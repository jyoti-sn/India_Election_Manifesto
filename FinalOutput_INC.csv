Introduction

 

At every stage of its 138-year journey, the Indian National Congress had identified itself with the problems, develop-
ment, aspirations and hopes of all the people of India. During the freedom struggle, its foremost aim was to win
freedom. It was guided by the wisdom and sacrifice of great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi. After independence, the
Congress’ article of faith was the Constitution of India of which Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar was the prime architect.

Since 1947, the Congress has been India’s beacon of hope. Our policies brought about rapid industrialisation in a
predominantly agrarian economy, transformed India from a famine-struck country to one that exports food grains to
countries around the world, laid the scientific and technical foundations for India’s rise as a global software
powerhouse, and built world class institutions in research and higher education whose graduates are seen as at par
with the world’s best. Even as liberalisation and reforms caused economic growth to boom under successive
Congress governments, our social welfare policies ensured that every citizen was able to participate in the India
story. The social welfare net created by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) such as the Mahatma Gandhi National
Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the National Food Security Act ensured that India was able to
absorb the shocks of the Global Financial Crisis (2008), the Taper Tantrum (2013), demonetisation (2016) and
COVID-19 (2020).

 

Five years ago, on the eve of the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had published a 54-page manifesto. Based on the
record of the first term of the Modi government, we had forewarned the people of the precarious state of our polity
and economy, and of the danger of re-electing the BUP/NDA government. Our assessment of the situation in the
country has, alas, proved true. Many of the weaknesses and woes have deepened in the last five years. The promises
and assurances that the Congress gave in its 2019 manifesto remain valid and doubly relevant today. Hence, we will
start with endorsing our 2019 manifesto and urge you to read the statements here as part of this manifesto.

We may recall our forewarning

¢ We had said, “Youth have lost jobs”. The unemployment rate is 8
percent; among graduates the unemployment rate is over 40%.

¢ We had said, “Farmers have lost hope”. Farmers had to come on to
the streets for 16 months to fight the three farm laws that would have
made them tenant-farmers of corporate houses; and the farmers are
back on the streets again.

* We had said, “Traders have lost business”. The Goods and Services
Tax (GST) laws have squeezed exorbitant tax revenues out of lakhs of
traders and constrained free trade.

© We had said, “Micro, small and medium enterprises have lost their
confidence”. Lakhs of MSMEs have shut down and are no longer
creators of jobs

¢ We had said, “Women have lost a sense of security”. Crimes against
women have increased by 31 per cent between 2014 and 2022.

© We had said “Deprived communities have lost their economic
rights”. Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other
Backward Classes (OBC) communities have been deprived of jobs
because of the unfilled vacancies in government and other public
institutions. Tribal people have been denied their rights under the
Forest Rights Act.

¢ We had said, “Institutions have lost independence”. Every institution,
including Constitutional bodies, has been undermined and, in some
cases, forced to become subservient to the government.

 

Our greatest concern was the prevailing ‘climate of fear, intimidation and hatred’. In the last five years, every section
of the people has lived in fear; laws and investigating agencies have been weaponised to intimidate people; and
through its words and actions the BJP and its affiliates have spread hatred among people belonging to different
religious, language and caste groups.

Today, the dangers that we had warned against have become a hard reality.

The economy is in a crisis. Despite the claim that India is the fastest growing large economy in the world, our growth
rate has fallen from an average of 6.7 per cent (new series) during the UPA period of 2004-14 to an average of 5.9 per
cent during 2014-24. As against the goal of doubling the economy (which the UPA did achieve), India’s GDP in real
terms will rise from € 100 lakh crore in 2013-14 to only = 173 lakh crore in 2023-24, far short of the target.

 

The decline in the growth rate has serious consequences for the people, especially for those who belong to the
poor and middle classes. The impact has fallen on per capita income, consumption of goods and services, and
standard of living. Household net assets have declined, household liabilities have increased and families have
borrowed more.

Inequality between the rich on the one hand and the poor and middle classes on the other have increased
sharply dealing a body blow to the goals of equality, equity, and social and economic justice. A report titled
“Income and Wealth Inequality in India, 1922-2023: The Rise of the Billionaire Raj” by leading global economists,
including Thomas Piketty, shows that India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is more unequal than even
under the British Raj. The share of national income earned by India’s top 1 per cent is today at its highest
historical levels and is among the highest globally. The rise of inequality has been particularly pronounced
between 2014 and 2023.

The numbers of registered and active workers under MGNREGA and the fact that 80 crore people depend on
free grain (5 kg per person per month) are definite indicators of widespread poverty. On the Global Hunger
Index, India’s rank is 111 out of 125 countries.

The gravest danger is that India may no longer be a truly free and democratic republic. Democracy in India has
been hollowed out and we are rapidly sliding to become a one-party and one-person dictatorship. The federal
structure is under attack with the central government appropriating most of the central revenues, passing laws
on subjects that were hitherto left to the state governments, and using its financial and executive powers to
reduce states to municipalities. Governors of non-BJP-governed states are encouraged to paralyse the working
of elected governments. Laws and investigating agencies are used to foist false cases against non-BJP leaders
to force them to submit to the BUP’s will. The media has been rewarded or intimidated to become a vehicle of
propaganda of the government.

Ask yourself two questions:
(1) Is your life better today than what it was in 2014?
(2) Is your mind without fear as dreamed by Rabindranath Tagore?

The choice is not Congress or BJP, but it is more than that. The choice is

Democratic government or Authoritarian rule
Freedom or Fear
Prosperity for All or Wealth for a Few
Justice or Injustice.

The 2024 general election presents an opportunity for radically changing the style and substance of gover-
nance that has been in evidence in the past decade of Anyay Kaal. We appeal to you to look beyond religion,
language and caste, choose wisely, and install a democratic government that will work for all the people of
India. We appeal to you to vote for the INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS.

Social Justice

Congress has been the most vocal and active champion of the progress of the backward and oppressed classes and
castes over the last seven decades. However, caste discrimination is still a reality. The people belonging to the SC, ST
and OBC communities have not yet been able to catch up with the rest and are still left behind. While OBC, SC and ST
constitute nearly 70 per cent of India’s population, their representation in high-ranking professions, services and
businesses is disproportionately low. No progressive modern society should tolerate such inequality or discrimina-
tion based on ancestry and the consequent denial of equal opportunity. Congress will bridge historical inequities by
implementing the following programme.

 

 

1.Congress will conduct a nation-wide Socio-Economic
and Caste Census to enumerate the castes and
sub-castes and their socio-economic conditions.
Based on the data, we will strengthen the agenda for
affirmative action.

2. The Congress guarantees that it will pass a
constitutional amendment to raise the 50 per cent cap
on reservations for SC, ST and OBC.

3. The reservation of 10 per cent in jobs and educational
institutions for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS)
will be implemented for all castes and communities
without discrimination.

4. We will fill all the backlog vacancies in posts reserved
for SC, ST and OBC within a period of one year.

5. Congress will abolish the contractualisation of
regular jobs in the government and public sector
enterprises and ensure regularisation of such
appointments.

6. We will enhance institutional credit to SC and ST for
home-building, starting businesses and purchasing
assets.

7. Congress will establish an authority to monitor the
distribution to the poor of government land and surplus
land under the land ceiling Acts.

8. The scope of the Public Procurement Policy will be
expanded to award more public works contracts to
contractors belonging to the SC and ST communities.

9. Funds for scholarships for OBC, SC and ST students
will be doubled, especially for higher education. We will
aid SC and ST students to study abroad; and will
double the number of scholarships for them to pursue
a Ph.D.

10. Congress will establish a network of residential
schools for the poor, especially SC and ST students,
and extend them to every block.

 

11. We will include in the curriculum of schools the life
and work of social reformers to spread the message of
social justice.

12. We will establish Ambedkar Bhavans-cum-Libraries
in every district to promote the habit of reading and
discussion.

13. We will enact a law with reference to Article 15(5) of
the Constitution to provide for reservation in private
educational institutions for SC, ST and OBC.

14. We will pass a law authorising allocation of resourc-
es for the Scheduled Caste Sub Plan and Tribal Sub Plan
within the annual budget and monitoring the execution
of the plans.

15. Congress will end the evil of manual scavenging.
Every manual scavenger will be rehabilitated, re-skilled,
provided a job and assured a life of dignity and safety.
The Prohibition of Manual Scavenging Act, 2013, will be
strictly implemented and any person employing anyone
for manual scavenging shall be punished. We will
provide compensation of ¥30 lakh to families of sanita-
tion workers (safai karamcharis) deceased while at
work. We will allocate sufficient funds to enable the
procurement of machines that will clean sewers and
septic tanks, and remove human waste. Free insurance
will be provided to all sanitation workers.

LINGUISTIC
MINORITIES

The plurality of religions represents the history of
India. History cannot be altered. All people living in
India and all children born in India are equally
entitled to enjoy human rights that includes the
right to practise one’s religion. Pluralism and
diversity constitute the ethos of India and are

COTS alaTat=reM [am taem eat=x-1anl°) (mom ual m econ ULL (eRe
India. Given the history and the democratic
traditions of India, the Congress believes that
there is no place for authoritarianism or majoritari-
anism.

 

Linguistic and religious minorities are granted

human and civic rights under the Constitution of
India. Congress pledges to uphold and protect
these rights.

    

16. The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 will be enforced
diligently. A helpline will be established in every State's
capital and legal aid and paralegal support will be
provided to the victims of such atrocities.

17. Congress is committed to notify as ‘Scheduled
Area’ all habitations or groups of habitations where ST
are the largest social group outside the present Sched-
uled Areas in all States and Union Territories.

18. A national mission will be set up for effective
implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006 through
a dedicated FRA division, a separate budget and action
plans.

19. The Congress will ensure settlement of all pending
FRA claims within 1 year and establish a process for
review of all rejected claims within 6 months.

20. Congress is committed to ensure that states enact
laws in conformity with the framework of the central
Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996
(PESA) to establish ‘Village Council’ and ‘Autonomous
District Council’ as envisaged in PESA.

21. We will enact the Rohith Vemula Act to address
discrimination faced by students belonging to the
backward and oppressed communities in educational
institutions.

22. We will implement the recommendations of the
Renke Commission. We will provide free education for
children belonging to the Nomadic Tribes and De-noti-
fied Tribes.

23. Congress will establish a Diversity Commission
that will measure, monitor and promote diversity in
public and private employment and education.

1.We will respect and uphold the fundamental right to
practice one’s faith and the rights guaranteed to
religious minorities under Articles 15, 16, 25, 26, 28, 29
and 30 of the Constitution.

2. We will also respect and uphold the rights of linguis-
tic minorities guaranteed under Articles 15, 16, 29 and
30 of the Constitution.

3. We will encourage and assist students and youth
belonging to the minorities to take full advantage of the
growing opportunities in education, employment,
business, services, sports, arts and other fields.

4. We will restore the Maulana Azad Scholarships for
study abroad and increase the number of scholarships.

5. The economic empowerment of minorities is a
necessary step for India to realise its full potential. We
will ensure that banks will provide institutional credit to
minorities without discrimination.

6. We will ensure that the minorities receive their fair
share of opportunities in education, healthcare, public
employment, public works contracts, skill development,
sports and cultural activities without discrimination.

7. Congress will ensure that, like every citizen, minori-
ties have the freedom of choice of dress, food,
language and personal laws.

8. We will encourage reform of personal laws. Such
reform must be undertaken with the participation and
consent of the communities concerned.

9. Congress promises to meet long standing demands
for inclusion of more languages in the Eighth Schedule
of the Constitution.

 

1. The central government's contribution to pensions for
senior citizens, widows and persons with disabilities
under the National Social Assistance Programme
remains a pitiful 200 - 500 per month. Congress will
raise this amount to 1,000 per month.

2. We will take measures to ensure easy access to legal
services for senior citizens especially in cases of
neglect, abuse, abandonment, eviction and financial
fraud.

3. Congress will review the Maintenance and Welfare of
Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, remove the
deficiencies and enforce the Act.

4. We will restore travel concessions in public transport
(rail and road) for senior citizens.

5. We will expand Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution
to prohibit discrimination on the ground of ‘disability’,
‘impairment’ or ‘sexual orientation’.

VM

Congress was the first political
party to acknowledge that health
of the people and healthcare are
the responsibility of the govern-
ment. Congress introduced the
first healthcare scheme in India
and firmly believes that all
citizens have the Right to Health.

\
\

1. We promise that healthcare will be universal and free
in public health centres such as hospitals, clinics,
primary health centres, mobile healthcare units, dispen-
saries and health camps. Free healthcare will include
examination, diagnostics, treatment, surgery, medicines,
rehabilitation and palliative care.

\

6. We will recognise the Braille script and Sign
Language as languages.

7. We will establish a National Centre of Research and
Excellence for Special Education to ensure that quality
education is imparted to children with special needs
and children with disabilities.

8. As was done in Chhattisgarh, Congress will provide
representation for persons with disabilities in local
government bodies.

9. We will strictly enforce the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities Act, 2016.

10. We will implement a scheme to establish Assisted
Living and Care Centres for the disabled in public-pri-
vate partnership throughout the country.

11. After wide consultation, Congress will bring a law
to recognize civil unions between couples belonging to
the LGBTQIA+ community.

   
 
 
 
  

‘

2. The Rajasthan Model of cashless insurance up to
%25 lakhs will be adopted for universal healthcare.

3. Primary Health Centres (PHC) will be upgraded
according to Indian Public Health Standards norms,
and diagnostics will be added in each PHC.

 

4. We will encourage the introduction of health
insurance schemes in the private sector and public
sector. The current universal healthcare programme will
be redesigned for different sections of the people and
will allow enlistment of private hospitals, non-profit
health facilities and health centres under the schemes.

5. Maternity benefits will be available to all women. All
employers shall mandatorily grant paid maternity leave
for their employees.

6. Budget allocation for Health will be increased step by
step every year to achieve 4 per cent of total
expenditure by 2028-29.

7. Congress will double the hardship allowance of
doctors serving in rural areas, and provide suitable
residence facilities.

8. The contribution of the Central government to the pay
of frontline health workers (such as ASHA,
Anganwadi, Mid-Day Meal cooks, etc.) will be doubled.

9. We will establish one government medical
college-cum-hospital in each district.

10. All vacancies in medical and paramedical posts in
public health institutions and all vacancies in medical
colleges will be filled in three years.

11. No hospital or medical college shall be permitted to
be opened or allowed to function unless 75 per cent of
the medical, paramedical and teaching posts are filled.

12. The National Medical Commission Act shall be
reviewed, and the anomalies and deficiencies removed.
NMC shall enjoy full autonomy to carry out the obliga-
tions under the Act.

13. A second ASHA will be appointed in villages with a
population of over 2,500.

14. All systems of medicine will be supported by the
government.

15. All manufacturers of medicines will be under strict
scrutiny for maintaining quality and following good
manufacturing practices.

16. The number of central government dispensaries
will be rapidly expanded. All central government
dispensaries will dispense brand and generic medi-
cines of good quality at reasonable prices.

17. A National Mission on Immunisation will be taken
up. Only 76 per cent of Indian children receive full
immunisation. Congress will ensure full immunisation
of 100 per cent of children within 5 years.

18. Nutritional deficiency among children will be
addressed to rapidly reduce the incidents of stunting
and wasting. We will expand the mid-day meal scheme
up to Class XII.

19. Congress will pass a law making it an offence to
commit acts of violence against doctors and other
health professionals while performing their duties.

YOUTH

Jobs

 

“The future lies in the youth of today” is particularly relevant for a young nation like India with a median age of just
28 years. The youth of India face joblessness as well as hopelessness. The root cause is massive unemployment
that has got worse every year under the BUP/NDA government. Congress will tackle this issue on a war footing with

a clear Yuva Nyay programme.

 

1. Congress guarantees a new Right to Apprenticeship
Act to provide a one year apprenticeship with a private
or a public sector company to every diploma holder or
college graduate below the age of 25. Apprentices will
get 1 lakh a year. The apprenticeship will impart skills,
enhance employability and provide full-time job opportu-
nities for millions of youth.

2. We will provide fast-track courts to adjudicate cases
of leaking question papers for job examinations and
provide monetary compensation to the victims.

3. We will fill the nearly 30 lakh vacancies in sanctioned
posts at various levels in the central government. We
will stipulate that vacancies in the

panchayats and municipal bodies shall be filled accord-
ing to a timetable agreed with state governments.

4. Congress will restructure the Fund of Funds Scheme
for start-ups and allocate 50 per cent of the available
fund, as far as possible equally among all districts, for
providing funds to youth below 40 years of age to start
their own businesses and generate employment.

cs rae OT TS

5. Government will give a one-time relief to applicants
who were unable to write the qualifying public exam-
inations during 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2021 due to the
pandemic.

6. We will abolish application fees for government
examinations and government posts.

7. Due to widespread unemployment, as a one-time
measure of relief, the amount due including unpaid
interest as on 15 March 2024 in respect of all student
educational loans will be written off and the banks will
be compensated by the government.

8. Congress will provide sports scholarships of
10,000 per month for talented and budding sportsper-
sons below the age of 21.

 

itera le)y

Education is a public good and every
student has the right to free, quality
education provided by the state. Schools,

colleges and universities should be
predominantly public institutions funded
by public resources. We recognise that
private educational institutions play an
important supplementary role.

 

1. Congress brought in the Right to Education (RTE) Act
in 2009 that transformed education for children
between the ages of 6 and 14. We will amend the RTE
Act to make education from Class | to Class XII in public
schools compulsory and free.

2. The New Education Policy (NEP) announced by the
BJP/NDA government has been opposed by education-
ists and several state governments. Education is a
concurrent subject and the rights of states to formulate
an education policy must be respected. Hence, we will
revisit and amend the NEP in consultation with the state
governments.

3. We will end the practice of charging special fees for
different purposes in public schools.

4. For greater equity, affordability and transparency in
school fees charged by private schools, we will encour-
age state governments to establish fee regulation
committees.

5. The quality of teaching is the most important deter-
minant of educational outcomes. Congress will work
with states to ensure that every class and every subject
has a dedicated teacher. Each class must have a
dedicated classroom.

6. Foundational learning emphasising literacy, numera-
cy, foundational science and Constitutional values in
schools is an important requirement for all children.
Congress will expand the budget for and scale up
government programmes for foundational learning.

 

7. School and college syllabuses will emphasise the
study of STEM subjects in order to develop a scientific
temper.

8. We will discourage the use of teachers for
non-teaching activities.

9. We will discourage the appointment of contractual
teachers in regular vacancies and ensure that such
appointments are regularised.

10. We will accelerate the integration of pre-primary
and primary education to ensure that all children
receive at least two years of pre-school education.

11. Annual surveys have revealed the huge gaps in
learning outcomes in school education. We shall take
urgent measures to address these deficiencies and
ensure wholesome learning outcomes within a period
of 5 years.

12. Congress will increase the number of Kendriya
Vidyalayas, Navodya Vidyalayas and Kasturba Gandhi
Balika Vidyalayas in consultation with the State
Governments.

13. We will restore the autonomy of colleges and
universities. Higher educational institutions will have
academic freedom and will be encouraged to experi-
ment, innovate and promote research. We will protect
and preserve students’ freedom of speech and expres-
sion and the right to have elected student unions.

12
ee

14. To reduce dropout rates, we will ensure that pre-ma-
tric and higher education scholarships for disadvan-
taged groups including SC, ST, OBC, EWS, denotified
tribes and minorities are restored, increased and fully
funded.

15. We will ensure that all central textbooks promote a
scientific temper and are aligned with India’s
constitutional values as contained in the Preamble and
other provisions of the Constitution of India. Textbook
revisions will not be done arbitrarily or driven by political
motives.

16. We will assist state governments to establish one
Government Community College in every tehsil/taluk for
students completing Class XII. These community
colleges will offer a broad range of degrees/diplomas
suitable for jobs in the service industry (e.g. hospitality,
tourism, digital marketing, paramedical, paralegal, etc.)
and for jobs in the manufacturing industry that require
basic technical skills.

17. Congress will revive the Education Loan programme
to college students implemented under the UPA govern-
ment and instruct banks to extend collateral-free
education loans up to *7.5 lakhs especially to students
belonging to the SC, ST, OBC, EWS and minorities.

18. Due to widespread unemployment, as a one-time
measure of relief, the amount due including unpaid
interest as on 15 March 2024 in respect of all student
educational loans will be written off and the banks will
be compensated by the government.

19. Congress will ensure that serving teachers are
represented in the governing bodies of colleges and
universities.

20. We will fill all teaching and non-teaching vacancies
in central universities and other central educational
institutions.

21. National accreditation bodies will be strengthened
and higher educational institutions will be accredited
based on stringent quality norms.

22. Online courses and digital learning have gained
importance. We will ensure that all students of classes
IX to XII have mobile phones to ensure equitable
access to learning. We will provide free and unlimited
Internet on college and school campuses to increase
accessibility and connectivity.

23. We will ensure that all coaching centres and
EdTech companies meet stringent quality standards.

24. We will ensure that all higher educational institu-
tions — central, state and private — meet the
prescribed standards for admitting students. We will
revisit the policy of centrally-conducted qualifying
examinations such as NEET, CUET, etc. and make it
optional for state governments to adopt these exam-
inations for admissions or conduct their own examina-
tions meeting the prescribed standards to state-funded
and state-approved higher educational institutions.

25. We will assist state governments to establish
state-of-the-art Internet-enabled public libraries in
state, district and taluk headquarters.

 

SPORTS

No government in India’s independent history
has politicised sports as much as the present
BJP/NDA government. From scheduling World
Cup games in select venues for overt political
purposes to turning a blind eye to harassment
of India’s Olympians by politically-aligned
persons in sports bodies, Indian sports is

arguably going through its worst phase.
Congress believes that Indian sport will soar
only when the autonomy of sports bodies is
restored, political bias is removed, and the
government is a strong and neutral supporting
force for sports development.

 

1. Congress will take suitable measures to ensure that
the constitution of each sports body is in accordance
with certain norms and principles, that elections are
held according to the constitution of that body and the
recommendations of the Justice Lodha Committee, and
that there is adequate representation in each sports
body for active players, former players and women.

2. Congress will enact a separate legislation for the
registration of sports federations/bodies/associations
which will ensure full compliance with the Olympic
Charter, allow for autonomy and full accountability, and
provide recourse for members and sportspersons
against discrimination, bias, sexual harassment, abuse,
wrongful termination, etc.

3. Congress will provide sports scholarships of ¥ 10,000
per month to talented and budding sports persons
below the age of 21.

4. Congress will ensure that there is at least one
community sports centre in every block and municipal
town and at least one multi-sport coaching centre in
every district.

5. We will establish a National Sports Science Institute
to promote research and development in sports scienc-
es and training.

 

6. In order to encourage talented youth to pursue
sports as a profession without fear of their future,
Congress will introduce a “Sporting Heroes Job Guar-
antee” programme to assure every sportsperson who
has represented India at the international level or the
national level a good quality job after the end of the
sportsperson’s sporting career.

7. We will allocate sufficient funds to promote sports
among girls and women, persons with disabilities, and
disadvantaged groups such as ST.

 

Mahalakshmi
Inequality of income and opportunity remains India’s ugliest truth. It is the moral and political responsibility of any
government to ensure that every Indian family is assured of a basic income every month.

 

1. Congress resolves to launch a Mahalakshmi scheme
to provide %1 lakh per year to every poor Indian family
as an unconditional cash transfer. The poor will be
identified among the families in the bottom of the
income pyramid.

2. The amount will be directly transferred to the bank
account of the oldest woman of the household.

Absent a woman, it will be transferred to the account of
the oldest member of the family.

3. The scheme will be rolled out in stages and reviewed
every year to assess the number of

beneficiary families and its impact on alleviating
poverty.

     

LEAD WITH
LOVE

 

1. The Constitution (106th) Amendment Act marks the
BJP’s great betrayal of women. The Amendment Act
contains sinister provisions that will allow the reserva-
tion of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies to
come into operation only beyond 2029. Congress will
delete the sinister provisions and bring the Amendment
Act into force immediately. The one-third reservation for
women will be applied to State Assemblies that will be
elected in the next round of Assembly elections in 2025.
The one-third reservation for women will also be applied
to the Lok Sabha that will be elected in 2029.

2. We will reserve one-half (50 per cent) of central
government jobs for women starting in 2025.

3. We will ensure that more women are appointed to
high positions such as judges, secretaries to govern-
ment, high ranking police officers, law officers and
directors on the boards of listed companies.

4. All laws will be scrutinised for gender discrimination
and gender bias. The offending provisions will be
removed or amended in the first year of the Congress
government.

5. We will ensure that the principle of ‘Same Work, Same
Wages’ is enforced in order to prevent discrimination in
wages for women.

6. The contribution of the Central government to the pay
of frontline health workers (such as ASHA, Anganwadi,
Mid-Day Meal cooks, etc.) will be doubled.

7. We will substantially increase the amount of institu-
tional credit that is extended to women. In particular, we
will vastly enhance the credit extended to Self Help
Groups by banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies
and Micro Finance Institutions.

8. The Labour Force Participation Rate of women is

an abysmal 25 per cent. We will embark on a massive
exercise to expand women’s participation in the work-
force through measures such as fair and equal wages;
safe places of work; childcare services; preventing
sexual harassment and violence; and extending materni-
ty benefits.

9. We will re-incorporate the Bhartiya Mahila Bank
(Women’s Bank) that had made a promising start under
an all-Women Board of Directors but was wound up by
the patriarchal BJP/NDA government.

10. In matters of marriage, succession, inheritance,
adoption, guardianship, etc., women and men should
have equal rights. We will review all the laws and ensure
equality between men and women.

11. We will ensure that laws intended to prevent
offences against women such as the Sexual Harass-
ment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition
and Redressal) Act, 2013 and the Protection of Women
from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 are strictly enforced.

12. The government will fund state governments to
build sufficient night shelters for migrant women
workers and adequate number of safe and hygienic
public toilets for women will be provided in towns and
cities. Free napkin vending machines will be installed in
public spaces, schools and colleges.

13. In partnership with the State governments, the
Central Government will double the number of working
women hostels in the country, with at least one Savit-
ribai Phule Hostel in each district.

14. We will appoint an Adhikar Maitri in every Pancha-
yats to serve as a paralegal to educate women and
assist them in the enforcement of their legal rights.

 

 

The farmers’ agitations ring the alarm bells to the deep crisis in the agriculture sector.

The BUP/NDA government's response has been callous and brutal. Farmers do not get fair and remunerative prices
for their produce; nor do the producers have adequate avenues to market their produce. Export controls have debili-
tated farmers. The plight of farm labourers is worse; the work available is irregular and the wages have stagnated for

nearly four years.

Agriculture

Congress is the only party that has lent its ear to the distress call of the farmers and farm labour and we are
determined to do everything possible to alleviate their pain and make agriculture a desirable livelihood.

—

 

1. Congress will give a legal guarantee to the Minimum
Support Prices (MSP) announced by the government
every year, as recommended by the Swaminathan
Commission.

2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices
(CACP) will be made a statutory body.

3. MSP payable to the farmer-seller at the procurement
centres and APMCs will be directly credited digitally to
the bank account of the farmer.

Agricultural Finance that will report periodically on the

settled within 30 days.

 

6. In consultation with farmers’ organizations, we will
make available to farmers three avenues for sale of
agricultural produce:

(a). Regulated Market under the prevailing APMC Act.

(b). E-market that will be operated by an autonomous
body with representation of farmers’ organizations,
Farmer-Producer Organizations (FPOs) and individual
progressive farmers.

(c). Freedom to the farmer to sell agricultural produce
at the farm-gate or at any other place of choice with an
option to upload the sale-and-purchase agreement on a
digital ledger.

7. We will establish farmers’ retail markets in large
villages and small towns to enable the farmers to bring
their produce and sell the same to consumers.

8. Congress will formulate and implement a sound
import-export policy for agricultural commodities, which
will give paramount importance to protecting the
interests and concerns of farmers.

9. We will revive the system of Agricultural Extension
Services to disseminate the best knowledge and best
practices to every agricultural holding. We will increase
the number of Krishi Vigyan Kendras and appoint more
scientists to each Kendra.

10. We will launch a major programme to install solar
panels connected to tube wells to generate energy.

11. Congress will implement a major initiative to
promote horticulture, pisciculture and sericulture, and
encourage farmers to diversify into these activities and
increase their income.

12. We will double the value of the output in dairying
and poultry in five years.

13. In co-ordination with state governments, we will
ensure that one agricultural college and one veterinary
college is established in every district of the country.

14. We will double the funding for R&D in agriculture in
five years.

 

 

aN Uwe

Kisan Credit Cards) by banks and extended credit.

5. Fishing communities will be enumerated in the caste
census and given identity cards by the Central Govern-
ment.

6. Inland fishing and aquaculture will be recognized as
‘agriculture’.

7. Congress will promote phytosanitary standards and
the exports of marine products that meet such
standards.

 

 

8. Fishing harbours will be developed along the coast
line for the use of the fishing community.

9. We will create cooperative banks for fishing
communities.

10. Congress will establish mechanisms with neigh-
bouring countries to resolve the problems faced by
fishing communities, to eliminate conflict, arrests,
seizure of boats and loss of lives, and to improve
livelihood opportunities for our fishing communities.

=

1. We will introduce reforms in industrial and labour
laws to restore the balance between labour and capital
to meet our twin goals of full employment and high
productivity gains.

2. We will address the issues of gender discrimination
and gender inequality in workplaces and in accessing
economic opportunities.

3. We will ensure that the principle of ‘Same Work, Same
Wages is enforced in order to prevent discrimination in

include pulses (dal) and cooking oil.

10. Sufficient funds will be allocated to PDS, ICDS and
the Mid-day Meal Scheme to fulfil the mandate of the
National Food Security Act, 2013.

11. We will collaborate with the state governments to
open Indira Canteens that will offer subsidised meals
as has been done in Karnataka and Rajasthan.

12. Appoint a second ASHA worker in all villages with a
population exceeding 2,500 persons.

13. Double the number of Anganwadi workers and
create an additional 14 lakh jobs.

14. The Congress guarantees a national minimum
wage at %400 per day.

 

DEFENDING THE
CONSTITUTION

Saving Democracy, Removing Fear, Restoring Freedom

Soe ‘ THE PEOPLE OF INDIA,
nin solemnly resolved to constitute India
into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST
SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
and to secute to all its citizens:

   
       
   

 
 

India’s democracy has been reduced to an empty shell. Every institution, including Parliament, is perceived to have
lost its independence and become subservient to the executive government. It is common knowledge that it is the
will of one person that prevails in the country. People’s trust in democratic institutions will be restored.

 

1.We promise you freedom from fear.

2. We promise to restore freedom of speech and
expression including full freedom of the media.

3. We promise to de-criminalise the offence of defama-
tion and provide, by law, a speedy remedy by way of civil
damages.

4. We promise to end the arbitrary and indiscriminate
suspension of the Internet.

5. We will review the Telecommunications Act, 2023 and
remove the provisions that restrict freedom of speech
and expression and that violate the right to privacy.

6. We promise to review all laws that interfere with the
right to privacy and make suitable amendments to
various laws to uphold the right to privacy.

7. We promise to uphold the people's right to assemble
peacefully and to form associations.

8. We promise not to interfere with personal choices of
food and dress, to love and marry, and to travel and
reside in any part of India. All laws and rules that
interfere unreasonably with personal freedoms will be
repealed.

9. We promise that the two Houses of Parliament will
each meet for 100 days in a year and the great
traditions of Parliament that prevailed in the past will
be revived and scrupulously observed. We promise that
one day in a week will be devoted to discuss the
agenda suggested by the opposition benches in each
House. We promise that the presiding officers of the
two Houses will be required to sever their connection
with any political party, remain neutral, and observe the
age-old norm that the ‘Speaker does not speak’.

 

10. We reject the ‘one nation one election’ idea and we
promise that elections to the Lok Sabha and the State
Assemblies will be held as and when they are due in
accordance with the Constitution and the traditions of a
parliamentary democracy.

11. We promise to restore the voters’ trust in the
election process. We will amend the election laws to
combine the efficiency of the electronic voting machine
(EVM) and the transparency of the ballot paper. Voting
will be through the EVM but the voter will be able to hold
and deposit the machine-generated voting slip into the
voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) unit. The
electronic vote tally will be matched against the VVPAT
slip tally.

12. We promise to strengthen the autonomy of the
Election Commission of India, the Central Information
Commission, the Human Rights Commission, the office
of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Commis-
sions for SC, ST, minorities and OBC, and other constitu-
tional bodies.

13. We promise to amend the Tenth Schedule of the
Constitution and make defection (leaving the original
party on which the MLA or MP was elected) an automat-
ic disqualification of the membership in the Assembly
or Parliament.

STE
THE DAMAGE

In the last 10 years tremendous damage was done
by the BUP/NDA by misusing the brute majority
enjoyed by it in Parliament to make laws that
violated the letter and spirit of the Constitution of
India as well as the fundamental principles of
law-making, namely, necessity, consultation,
reasonableness and proportionality.

We promise that all anti-people laws passed by the
BJP/NDA without proper parliamentary scrutiny
and debate, especially those relating to workers,
farmers, criminal justice, environment & forests
and digital data protection, will be thoroughly
reviewed and changed.

We will carry out complete investigations of the
Electoral Bonds Scam, the reckless sale of public
assets, the PM CARES scam, repeated intelligence
failures at the highest levels and corruption in
major defence deals.

14. We promise to restore the Planning Commission
and define its role and responsibilities that will include
formulating medium and long-term perspective plans
to meet the needs of the Nav Sankalp Economic Policy
described in Chapter VII.

15. We promise to ensure that the police, investigation
and intelligence agencies will function strictly in
accordance with law. They will be brought under the
oversight of Parliament or the state legislatures, as the
case may be.

16. We promise to put an end to the weaponisation of
laws, arbitrary searches, seizures and attachments,
arbitrary and indiscriminate arrests, third-degree
methods, prolonged custody, custodial deaths, and
bulldozer justice.

17. We promise to enact a law on bail that will incorpo-
rate the principle that ‘bail is the rule, jail is the excep-
tion’ in all criminal laws.

18. We will introduce comprehensive prison reform to
transform jails into institutions of rehabilitation, reform
and correction.

i
a

 

MEDIA

In the last ten years, significant sections
of the media have been robbed of, or

surrendered, their freedom. Congress will
help the media re-discover the freedom
that they enjoy under the Constitution.

1. Congress has always believed that self-regulation is
the best way to correct the misuse of the media.
Congress will amend the Press Council of India Act,
1978 to strengthen the system of self-regulation, protect
journalistic freedoms, uphold editorial independence
and guard against government interference.

2. Congress will amend the Press Council of India Act,
1978 to empower the Council to deal with the menace
of fake news and paid news.

3. Congress will defend independent journalism by
enacting laws to protect journalists from coercive action
by the State. This includes restricting the powers of the
government for surveillance of journalists, seizure of
their devices and exposure of their sources.

4. Congress will pass a law to curb monopolies in the
media, cross-ownership of different segments of the
media, and control of the media by business organisa-
tions. Congress will refer cases of suspected monopo-
lies to the Competition Commission of India.

23
ee

 

5. All media houses, irrespective of the size, will be
required to disclose their ownership structures (direct
and indirect), cross holdings, revenue streams, etc.
through their websites.

6. Congress will pass a law to preserve the freedom of
the Internet and to prevent arbitrary and frequent
shutdowns of the Internet.

7. Many new laws (e.g. the Broadcasting Services
(Regulation) Bill, 2023; Digital Personal Data Protection
Act, 2023; Press and Registration of Periodicals Act,
2023, etc.) give unbridled powers of censorship to the
government. The first named Bill will be withdrawn. The
restrictive provisions of the two Acts will be amended
or deleted to eliminate backdoor censorship.

8. Congress will amend the Cinematograph Act, 1952
to provide that the Central Board of Film Certification
grants graded certificates to according to transparent
and reasonable criteria.

ae A

Thanks to the misgovernance, weaponisation of
the laws, misuse of investigating agencies and
abuse of executive powers by the BJP/NDA

government in the last 10 years, the people have
come to look upon the judiciary as the last
bastion against anti-democratic actions and
authoritarianism. An independent judiciary alone
can uphold the Constitution of India.

1. The independence and quality of the judiciary is
reflected in the independence and quality of the judges.
Congress will unswervingly uphold the independence of
the judiciary. In consultation with the Supreme Court
and the Chief Justices of the High Courts, Congress will
establish a National Judicial Commission (NJC). The
composition of the NJC will be decided in consultation
with the Supreme Court. The NJC will be responsible for
the selection and appointment of judges of the High
Courts and the Supreme Court.

2. All vacancies in the High Courts and Supreme Court
will be filled within three years.

3. Congress will amend the Constitution to create two
divisions in the Supreme Court: a Constitutional Court
and a Court of Appeal. The Constitutional Court consist-
ing of the seven seniormost judges will hear and decide
cases involving the interpretation of the Constitution
and other cases of legal significance or national impor-
tance. The Court of Appeal will be the final court of
appeal that will, sitting in Benches of three judges each,
hear appeals from the High Court and National Tribu-
nals.

 

4. We will allocate sufficient funds for augmenting the
physical and technical infrastructure of the judiciary
and for the modernisation and maintenance of the
infrastructure.

5. More women and persons belonging to the SC, ST,
OBC and minorities will be appointed as judges of the
High Courts and the Supreme Court.

6. Congress will establish a Judicial Complaints
Commission consisting of retired judges of the
Supreme Court and retired Chief Justices of the High
Courts to investigate complaints of misconduct
against judges of the higher judiciary.

censor or intimidate artists will be dealt with firmly and
according to law.

2. Congress will commit resources and attention to
sustaining India’s living traditions, especially to the
flourishing of our distinct indigenous cultures.

3. We will empower the artisan economy and promote
crafts-based enterprises.

4. Congress will ensure the autonomy of national
cultural institutions, including financial autonomy. These
institutions will be administered by renowned artists
and experts in the field.

5. We will promote art education in schools and
colleges, and support institutions that exclusively teach
the arts.

6. We will intensify the efforts to retrieve India’s stolen
art and also support private efforts.

7. Congress will support government and private
efforts to establish museums, art galleries, libraries
and archives. This will include smaller institutions at
the district level, which are the repositories of local
knowledge about artists, artisans, folk culture and
communities. We will support measures to create
digital archives.

8. We will work with state governments to build a
national network of libraries. We will support mobile
and community libraries.

9. We will ensure that the National Mission on Monu-
ments and Antiquities is revitalised. The Archaeologi-
cal Survey of India will be provided more funds and
human resources.

10. We will offer grants for the translation of traditional
and contemporary expressions of Indian culture into
Indian and foreign languages to foster national integra-
tion and Indian soft power abroad.

11. We will review and strengthen the Copyright Act,
1957.

 

ECONOMY

 

Our Economic Policy

Economic justice is as important as political and social justice. Sound economic policies will ensure that India, a
developing country, will attain the status of, first, a middle-income country and, then, a developed country.

Congress’ economic policy has evolved over the years. In 1991, the Congress ushered in the era of liberalization and
steered the country toward an open, free and competitive economy with regulatory oversight. The country reaped
enormous benefits in terms of wealth-creation, new businesses and entrepreneurs, a huge middle class, millions of
jobs, important innovations in education and healthcare, and exports. Millions of people were lifted out of poverty. We
reiterate our commitment to an open economy in which economic growth will be driven by the private sector comple-

mented by a strong and viable public sector.

TIME FOR A RE-SET

After 33 years, the time is ripe for a re-set of economic
policy. We need a Nav Sankalp Economic Policy. The
cornerstone of the Nav Sankalp Economic Policy will
be JOBS. To create jobs, India must become a
producing economy. We must produce goods and
services for ourselves and for the world. There is a
huge opportunity for India to emerge as the world’s
biggest producer.

We reject jobless growth and the BUP’s legacy of
job-loss growth. We will address the issues of inflation;
extreme poverty among a significant section of the
people; hunger; nutritional deficiency among women
and children; and the growing inequalities of income
and wealth.

The three goals of our economic policy were, and will
be, work, wealth and welfare.

 

WORK

 

Work means there will be plenty of jobs and sufficient opportunities for self-employment and starting businesses.

1. We will create thousands of jobs as outlined in the
next chapter. The best creator of jobs is the private
sector. In particular, the MSME sector is the creator of
the largest number of jobs, especially for workers with
average education and average skills.

2. We will support the private sector and every kind of
enterprise — large, medium, small and micro — in their
endeavour to create jobs and produce goods and
services.

3. We will remove the current environment of distrust
and fear, and create a healthy eco-system where
private enterprises, regulatory authorities, tax authori-
ties and government will work in a spirit of mutual
cooperation and respect.

4. We will protect innovation and intellectual property
rights, provide access to finances, and ensure the
freedom to produce and sell anywhere in India or
abroad.

 

5. We will support free trade and rule-based internation-
al trade and commerce.

6. We will encourage and participate in bilateral and
multilateral trade agreements.

7. Regulatory oversight will be based on clearly enunci-
ated laws and rules that will be applied fairly and
without discrimination.

8. We will ensure a level playing field for all.

9. We are opposed to monopolies and oligopolies and
crony capitalism.

10. We will ensure that no company or person arrogates
to itself or himself the financial or material resources or
the business opportunities or the concessions that
ought to be available to every entrepreneur.

11. Our policy preference will be in favour of business
enterprises that create a large number of jobs.

12. Full employment is our goal and we will make every
effort to ensure that the large workforce is gainfully
employed.

13. We will introduce reforms in industrial and labour
laws to restore the balance between labour and capital
to meet our twin goals of full employment and high
productivity gains. The Labour Codes passed by the
BJP/NDA government will be reviewed and amended.

14. We will address the issues of gender discrimination
and gender inequality in workplaces and in accessing
economic opportunities.

15. We will ensure that banks offer low-interest loans
to Self-Help Groups.

16. Congress will undertake a comprehensive review of
various charges levied by banks, stop the exploitation
of customers, and rationalize the charges for bank
services.

17. We will launch an urban employment programme
guaranteeing work for the urban poor in reconstruction
and renewal of urban infrastructure.

18. We will make a law to specify and protect the rights
of gig workers and unorganised workers and enhance
their social security.

19. We will propose laws to regulate the employment
of domestic help and migrant workers, and ensure their
basic legal rights.

20. We will reorient the tax policies towards employ-
ment and wages as well as investments and profits.

 

 

21. We will address the growing inequality of wealth
and income through suitable changes in policies.

 

WEALTH

Wealth and wealth creation are the goals of any business.
Industrial and business policies and regulations will be
designed to facilitate the production of goods and services in
larger volumes and higher values. While production is import-
ant, productivity is equally important. Any impediment, legal
or administrative, to larger production or higher value will be
removed. We will facilitate access to finances, raw materials,
technology, intellectual property, and other resources both
from within India and through imports. Business enterprises
will have the liberty to sell goods and services within India or
through exports. All laws and rules that inhibit free and fair
trade will be reviewed and changed.

India’s GDP in 1990-91 was approximately €25 lakh crore in
constant prices. In 13 years, first under a Congress govern-
ment and later under coalition governments, the GDP doubled
and reached a value of = 50 lakh crore in 2003-04. In 10 years
under the UPA, the economy doubled again and the GDP was
at 100 lakh crore in 2013-14. A% 100 lakh crore economy
was inherited by the BJP/NDA government but it wasted the
golden opportunity. If the UPA had continued in office, the
economy would have doubled again and stood at 200 lakh
crore in 2023-24. Alas, due to the BUP’s mismanagement, the
GDP will reach a level of only 173 lakh crore by the end of
2023-24 falling short of a target that was unachievable.

The Congress is committed to rapid growth and generation of
wealth. We have set a target of doubling the GDP in the next
10 years.

 

WELFARE

Welfare of all is the goal of all work and the creation of wealth. Owing to the skewed policies of the BJP/NDA, the
people of India are divided in economic terms. There is a small class of very rich, a substantial middle class, a large
segment of people above the poverty line but not yet the middle class, and nearly 22 crore people who are poor.
Under a Congress government, the welfare of the poor will be the first charge on all government resources. It will be
the Congress’ endeavour to ensure that the 22 crore people below the poverty line are lifted above the line in the next
10 years; that they are able to enjoy the fruits of education, healthcare, housing, drinking water, sanitation, electricity
and, above all, opportunities for jobs/work; and are made strong and self-reliant to compete with others who are
higher on the economic ladder.

As people move up the economic ladder, their needs are for better infrastructure and better goods and services.
Besides, we must get the Indian economy and the Indian work force ‘future-ready’. The challenges of the future
include the changes in the global economy, advanced technology such as Artificial Intelligence, robotics and machine
learning, and climate change. The future of our energy is Green Energy. We will mobilize the massive capital required
for our green energy transition.

The Nav Sankalp Economic Policy will aim to build a fair, just and equal-opportunity economy and bring prosperity to
all sections of the people. Congress will herald a new beginning, just as we did in 1991, involving all sections of the
people in nation-building. The time has become to re-set and re-prioritize our roadmap for economic development in
the context of the twin challenges to our economy, namely, UNEMPLOYMENT and INFLATION.

We have made specific promises in different sections of this Manifesto. By implementing these promises, we hope to
achieve the paramount goal of ushering in a fair, just and equitable economy that will make India a rich country, and
that will be resilient to adapt to a changing world.

 

1.Fill the nearly 30 lakh vacancies in sanctioned posts
at various levels in the central government, teaching and
non-teaching posts in central educational institutions,
posts of doctors, nurses, paramedics and other support-
ing staff in central government medical institutions, and
vacancies in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF).

2. Publish a job calendar for each department, institu-
tion and public body with details of vacancies and the
timelines to fill the vacancies.

3. Abolish the Agnipath programme and direct the
Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard)
to resume normal recruitment to achieve the full sanc-
tioned strength.

4. Appoint a second ASHA worker in all villages with a
population exceeding 2,500 persons.

5. Double the number of Anganwadi workers and create
an additional 14 lakh jobs.

6. Create a new employment-linked incentive (ELI)
Scheme for corporates to win tax credits for additional
hiring against regular, quality jobs.

7. Launch a strategic mining programme to explore and
mine rare earths and critical minerals with the object of
increasing the share of mining to 5 per cent of GDP and
creating 1.5 crore jobs for unskilled and skilled workers
in the mineral-rich states.

 

The programme will be implemented consistent with
stringent environmental and labour safety standards.

8. We will launch an urban employment programme
guaranteeing work for the urban poor in reconstruction
and renewal of urban infrastructure.

9. Provide jobs for low-education, low-skilled youth by
launching a Water Bodies Restoration Programme and
a Wasteland Regeneration Programme that will be
implemented through village panchayats and munici-
palities.

10. Establish an autonomous non-profit society
involving the state governments, universities and
business organisations to establish at least one Skills
Training Institute in each district to impart skills
through short- and long-term courses to youth in the
age group of 18-29 years. Incentivise corporates to use
CSR funds for skill training in recognised skill training
institutes.

11. Incentivise panchayats to establish and maintain
solar grids that will generate power for common
purposes and create jobs at the panchayats level.

12. Amend the laws to make workplaces safer for
women workers and with facilities for care of small
children. Facilitate travel to such workplaces.

TAXATION AND
TAX REFORMS

Taxation forms the core of governance. The
last ten years of the BUP/NDA government is a
case of “taxation gone berserk”. The share of
taxes paid by the common person and the poor
through regressive indirect taxes has increased
significantly and the share of taxes paid by
corporates has decreased — the exact opposite
of what a people-friendly and progressive
taxation policy should be. Despite the tall
claims of increasing the tax base through
demonetistion and GST, India’s overall tax to
GDP has not increased in the last decade,
leaving very little room for increased expendi-
ture. Congress will undertake a complete
overhaul of India’s taxation system to make it
people-friendly and efficient, and to incentivise
private savings and investment.

1. Congress will enact a Direct Taxes Code that will
usher in an era of transparency, equity, clarity and
impartial tax administration of direct taxes.

2. Congress will maintain stable personal income tax
rates throughout its term. This will ensure that the
salaried class is not subjected to rising tax rates and
have clarity to plan their finances over the medi-
um-to-long period.

3. We will eliminate “Angel tax” and all other exploitative
tax schemes that inhibit investment in new micro, small
companies and innovative start-ups.

4. Congress will lessen the burden of tax on MSMEs
owned by individuals and partnership firms.

5. We will end the duplicitous “cess” raj of the Modi
government to deny states their rightful share of tax
revenues by introducing a law to limit Union cess and
surcharges to 5 per cent of gross tax revenues.

6. Congress will replace the GST laws enacted by the
BJP/NDA government with GST 2.0. The new GST
regime will be based on the universally accepted
principle that GST shall be a single, moderate rate (with
a few exceptions) that will not burden the poor.

 

7. GST will not be levied on agricultural inputs.

8. The GST Council will be re-designed. It will be the
final authority on policy and on all matters relating to
GST.

9. The administration of GST laws will be divided
horizontally between the central government and the
state governments. Small GST-payers below a thresh-
old will come under the purview of the state govern-
ments.

10. A portion of GST revenues will be allocated to
pnchayats and municipalities.

11. Shopkeepers and small retail businesses that face
intense competition from online businesses will be
given significant tax relief.

12. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), the
Goods and Services Tax Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT)
and the Customs Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) will be
autonomous judicial bodies without interference by the
government.

In order to become a developed economy and create good quality jobs for hundreds of thousands of youth, it
is critical that India transitions from a consumer economy to a producer economy. India must become a
manufacturing powerhouse that produces goods and services for itself and the world. To this end, beyond
economic and business factors, the most vital ingredient is social harmony that will attract investments and
a skilled labour force. It is thus no surprise that in the last 25 years, India’s manufacturing share of GDP has
been higher during the Congress rule. On the contrary, in the last 10 years (2014-24), the share of manufac-
turing has stagnated at 14 per cent.

‘a

1. Congress resolves to make India a manufacturing
hub by raising the share of manufacturing from 14 per
cent to 20 per cent of GDP in the next five years.

2. The most immediate objective will be to restore a
healthy, fearless and a trustworthy climate for business-
es. While a Congress government in 1991 abolished
industrial licensing and controls, the independent
regulatory regime that was put in place has deteriorated
into a system of overt and covert controls. We will
conduct a comprehensive review of the current rules
and regulations and repeal or amend them in order to
restore freedom to industry, business and trade.

3. Congress will aim for India attaining a position of
leadership in multiple industries such as steel, metals,
garments and textiles, cement, automobiles, electronic
goods, pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, petroleum
products, chemicals, and mining rare earths and critical
minerals.

4. According to the RBI, nearly 60 per cent of the large
central government projects have been stalled or
delayed and costs have risen by nearly <5 lakh crores.
Congress will address the problem in a mission-mode
and find ways and means to revive the stalled projects
with the help of the private sector.

 

5. Congress will reform the production-linked incen-
tives (PLI) scheme to target specific sectors that can
create thousands of jobs by making India one of the
top 5 producers in the world in that sector.

6. We will introduce a new employment-linked incentive
(ELI) Scheme for corporates to win tax credits for
additional hiring against regular, quality jobs.

7. We will give the highest priority to intellectual
property rights and to the registration, acquisition,
protection and use of IPR in small, medium and large
businesses.

8. Congress will create a level playing field for all
businesses. We are opposed to monopolies and
oligopolies. We will strengthen the Competition Com-
mission of India in order to ensure that India will be an
open and competitive economy.

9. Congress will simplify the corporate taxation struc-
ture and end tax terrorism. We will restrain the investi-
gating agencies from misusing their powers to reward
or punish corporates and ensure that they act within
the strict limits of the law.

10. We will encourage and support the use of Artificial
Intelligence, robotics, etc. which will create new and
frontline jobs. At the same time, we will ensure that
there are more job opportunities in sectors that use
conventional technology.

The hardware of an economy are roads, railways,
ports, airports and electricity. Capital expenditure

and modern technology have to be mobilized to
create infrastructure of world class quality. A
variety of models of building infrastructure must be
adopted according to the needs of the economy.

1. Congress will mobilize public and private capital,
increase the pace of construction, and augment infra-
structure. The focus will be on design, quality, speed of
implementation, maintenance and accountability.

2. Private capital must be attracted to create public
assets and infrastructure. The BJP/NDA government
has inverted this model and is using public money to
create assets that eventually find their way into private
hands. Congress will stop this loot of public money.

3. We will modernise the outdated railway infrastructure
but in doing so we will ensure that trains and stations
serve the needs of the common people and commuters.
The railway services and facilities available to the poor
and middle classes will be continued.

4. KAVACH, an anti-collision device, was developed
during the term of the UPA. KAVACH will be installed in
all train engines and routes to improve passenger safety
on Indian railways.

5. Transport facilities and connectivity between rural
areas and the nearby town/city will be augmented so
that people may live in rural areas and work in urban

areas.

6. Congress will implement a comprehensive plan for
multi-modal urban public transport.

 

7. Road tolls are perceived by the road-users as
excessive and exploitative. The policy on Road Tolls
will be reviewed and formulae will be applied to deter-
mine the toll amount and the period of levy for each
stretch of the road.

8. A regulatory regime for ports and airports will be
established to promote efficiency and competition
among ports/airports.

9. We will promote green energy. We will implement
renewable energy schemes that will make the
panchayats or municipality self-sufficient in electricity
as far as possible. We will promote solar-powered
engines for tapping groundwater for agriculture.

10. We will ensure that modern scientific methods for
exploration and extraction of natural resources are
followed to protect and preserve the local environment
and communities. Representatives from the concerned
panchayat or municipality will be consulted before
undertaking such projects.

Centre-State Relations

Federalism is the foundational principle of ‘India is a
Union of States’. India’s fabric of federalism stitched
together by mutual trust between the Union and States
has been systematically destroyed by the BJP/NDA
government. Congress affirms its belief that India
cannot be administered by the central government
alone. In most matters concerning the daily lives of the
people, it is the state government that is close to the
people and, in some matters, it is the local government
(panchayats or municipality) that is closer to the people.

1. We will review the distribution of legislative fields in
the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and build a
consensus on transferring some fields from List III
(Concurrent List) to List II (State List).

2. India is one and many at the same time. Its unity gets
strengthened when its diversities are accommodated
and celebrated. This has always been Congress’ stance
and will remain so. Article 1 of the Constitution begins
with the words “India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of
States.” This is the guiding principle of federalism in our
country.

3. Congress will end the duplicitous “cess” raj of the
BJP/NDA government to deny states their rightful share
of tax revenues. We will introduce a law to limit Union
cess and surcharges to 5 per cent of gross tax
revenues.

4. We will instruct the Finance Commission to take into
account factors such as demographic performance and
tax efforts in determining the shares of states in the
devolution of central tax revenues. We will work with
state governments to evolve a formula to devolve funds,
including a share of GST revenues, directly to pancha-
yats and municipalities.

5. Taking into account rapid urbanisation, we will amend
the laws to grant more executive, financial and adminis-
trative powers to the directly-elected Mayor/Chairperson
for effective governance in urban local bodies. The
administration will be accountable to the Mayor/Chair-
person and the Council.

 

6. Congress, as the author of the 73rd and 74th Consti-
tution Amendments, will prevail upon the states to
implement those provisions in letter and spirit and
devolve funds, functions and functionaries upon the
panchayat and municipality.

 

7. Congress will enhance the role and authority of Gram
Sabhas in matters concerning village panchayats. We
will enhance the authority of the Gram Sabha in the
administration of the following Acts:

(a.) The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas)
Act, 1996.

(b.) The Forest Rights Act, 2006.
(c.) The Land Acquisition Act, 2013.
8. Congress will enhance financial assistance to the

Autonomous District Councils in the North Eastern
states.

9. We will immediately restore full statehood to Jammu
and Kashmir. We will amend the Sixth Schedule of the
Constitution to include the tribal areas of Ladakh.

 

RURAL AND URBAN
DEVELOPMENT

The two realities that India faces are (1) that nearly 60 per

cent of the people live in rural areas and (2) urbanisation is
taking place rapidly. Hence, we have to pay equal attention
to rural development and urban development, and provide
adequate infrastructure in our villages and towns/cities.

10. We will give Special Category status to Andhra
Pradesh as promised on 20 February 2014.

11. We will amend the Government of National Capital
Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 and declare that the
Lieutenant Governor shall act on the aid and advice of
the Council of Ministers of NCT, Delhi on all matters,
including Services, except on matters concerning the
three reserved subjects.

12. We will grant full statehood to Puducherry.

 

Some issues like livelihoods, housing, water, electricity, habitat, pollution, climate change, transport and disaster

management are common to both rural and urban areas.

1. For rural areas, Congress will pass the Right to
Homestead Act, extend the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak
Yojana to all villages and habitations, and increase the
funds to and quicken the pace of implementation of the
National Drinking Water Mission.

2. We will increase the wage under MGNREGA to % 400
per day. MGNREGA funds and workers may also be
deployed to build public assets such as classrooms,
libraries and primary health centres.

3. We will launch an urban employment programme
guaranteeing work for the urban poor in reconstruction
and renewal of urban infrastructure.

4. To regulate the mindless expansion of existing
cities, Congress will support the construction of a twin
city near an existing city but separated by a clear green
and no-construction zone between the old and new
cities.

5. To improve urban governance, the Mayor/Chairper-
son will be directly elected for a fixed term of 5 years
along with a Council. Executive, financial and adminis-
trative powers will be conferred upon the Mayor/Chair-
person. The administration will be accountable to the
Mayor/Chairperson and the Council.

6. Transport facilities and connectivity between rural
areas and the nearby town/city will be augmented so
that people may live in rural areas and work in urban

areas.

 

7. Congress will implement a comprehensive plan for
multi-modal urban public transport.

8. Travel/transport will be made safer for women and
children, especially in towns and cities.

9. The menace of stray dogs has acquired alarming
proportions. Solutions will be found that will protect
humans (especially children) and that are consistent
with a humanitarian approach to animals.

Se
EASTERN
STATES

The North Eastern states within the
Union of India represent the pluralism
and diversity of India. We are proud that
we are a diverse country that is home to
many races, religions and languages.

1. We will assess the infrastructure deficit in the North
Eastern states and provide more funds for building
infrastructure.

2. We will support Border Trade and make every effort
to increase the volume and value of such trade.

3. Congress will revive the Autonomous District Coun-
cils (ADCs) in the North Eastern states and make them
an effective instrument of local government. We will
ensure that more funds are channelised through the
ADCs for developmental works.

4. We will ensure that tea garden workers receive fair
wages and other benefits in accordance with the
applicable laws and agreements.

10. We will prevail upon the states to implement the
73rd and 74th Amendment to the Constitution in letter
and spirit and ensure that funds, functions and
functionaries are devolved upon the panchayats and
municipalities.

 

5. The situation in Manipur has gone from bad to
worse due to the callous neglect of the BJP/NDA
government. Congress will remove the present state
government forthwith and heal the wounds between
the communities. We will appoint a Reconciliation
Commission to bring about a political and administra-
tive settlement that will be satisfactory to all the people
of the state.

6. We will ensure appropriate compensation and
redress for the victims and survivors of the conflict in
Manipur.

7. A final solution and agreement will be entered into
with the Naga groups on the basis of the preliminary
agreement that had been agreed in 2013-14.

Defence

 

The Chinese intrusions in Ladakh and the Galwan clash in 2020 represented the biggest setbacks to Indian national
security in decades. On 19 June 2020, PM Narendra Modi gave a clean chit to China that considerably weakened our
negotiating position. Despite 21 rounds of military-level talks, Chinese troops continue to occupy Indian territory and
deny Indian forces access to 26 out of 65 patrolling points, equivalent to an area of 2,000 square km in eastern
Ladakh. A Chinese buildup in Doklam threatens the Siliguri Corridor that connects northeast India with the rest of the

country.

 

1.The absence of a formal National Security Strategy
has led to ad hoc and personalised policymaking.
After detailed deliberations, Congress will issue a
comprehensive National Security Strategy.

2. The Raksha Mantri’s Operational Directive determines
the Armed Forces’ war planning. The UPA government
issued the last directive in 2009. Congress will bring a
new Operational Directive to deal with our current
two-front challenge.

3. The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) is a sensitive and
crucial post for military reform, preparedness and joint
operations. Congress will institutionalise the process of
appointing the CDS to ensure transparency and military
consensus.

4. We will reverse the decline in defence expenditure as
a proportion of total expenditure and will ensure that
sufficient funds are allocated and spent to meet the
requirements of the Armed Forces.

5. Congress will scrap the Agnipath Scheme and return
to the normal recruitment processes followed by the
Army, Navy and Air Force that will guarantee economic
and social security for our soldiers.

6. Congress will systematically expand the opportuni-
ties for women to serve in combatant and non-combat-
ant roles in the Armed Forces.

7. The National Security Council (NSC) and the office
of National Security Adviser (NSA) will be brought
under the oversight of a select committee of Parlia-
ment.

8. The concept of national security in the 21st century
has expanded beyond defence of the territory to
include hybrid warfare, data security, cyber security,
financial security, communication security and security
of trade routes. Congress will evolve suitable policies
to address each of these subjects.

 

9. Congress will establish a National Economic
Security Board under the NSC with the following objec-
tives:

(a.) to monitor possible risks to global supply chain
disruptions and suggest counter actions;

(b.) to suggest measures to reduce over-dependence
on large import sources;

(c.) to recommend future courses of action toward
inward and outward investments that will strengthen
India's footprint in the world;

(d.) to monitor global financial flows and identify
potential threats to India, along with actions required to
mitigate them in advance; and

(e.) to work on digital/cybersecurity issues that may
threaten India's digital financial infrastructure.

AE

In the aftermath of the Mumbai terror attacks in

2008, Congress revamped the internal security
system and implemented a number of radical
measures. Distressingly, gaps have emerged in
the system. Besides, the increase in hate
speeches, hate crimes and communal strife
has compounded the situation.

1.Congress will put down with a firm hand hate speech-
es, hate crimes and communal conflicts. According to
NCRB data, crimes against women, SC, ST and minori-
ties have increased. We will identify the perpetrators of
such crimes as well as their sponsors and punish them
in accordance with law.

2. Congress is firmly opposed to extra-judicial illegal
measures like mob lynching, police encounter killings
and bulldozer justice. We will stop them immediately
and punish the perpetrators in accordance with law.

3. The unfinished agenda of the 2008 reforms are:

*NATGRID and
*National Counter-Terrorism Centre.

Congress will take up the two subjects, complete the
work, and operationalise them within one year.

10. We will rapidly expand domestic capacity to
manufacture defence and security hardware and
equipment.

11. One Rank One Pension (OROP) will be implemented
in accordance with the order of the UPA government
dated 26 February 2014. Anomalies that have arisen in
the implementation of OROP by the BJP/NDA govern-
ment will be rectified. We will restore the disability
pension and make it tax-free.

 

4. The State police is the first responder to threats to
internal security. Congress will work with State govern-
ments to build, train and equip the State police forces
to maintain law and order and to punish offenders
without fear or favour.

5. Trafficking and selling of drugs will be put down with
a firm hand. Increasingly, ports are used to smuggle
drugs. The regulatory and penal provisions will be
strengthened, and drug smugglers and traffickers, and
their accomplices, will be dealt with sternly in accor-
dance with law.

6. The strength of the Central Armed Police Forces
(CAPF) will be augmented and modernized. Our goal is
that 33 per cent of these forces will be made up of
women. The Service Rules will be revised and updated.
The forces will be deployed having regard to the needs
of training, rest and recuperation.

7. We will fill the vacancies in the CAPF and achieve
the full sanctioned strength.

 

 

FOREIGN POLICY

1. Congress affirms and will uphold continuity in India’s
foreign policy. Our approach was profoundly shaped by
the freedom movement and developed through the
wisdom of visionary leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru.

2. There was a consensus on foreign policy since
Independence. Unfortunately, in many areas, foreign
policy under the BUP/NDA government has witnessed
marked departures from this consensus, notably on the
ongoing Gaza conflict. Congress pledges to restore
India’s global reputation as a voice of peace and moder-
ation in world affairs.

3. Congress re-affirms its firm belief in the continued
relevance of the established policy of peaceful co-exis-
tence, strategic autonomy in thought and action, and
increased bilateral engagement in its relations with the
countries of the world.

4. We will work to strengthen India’s role in multilateral
institutions, co-ordinate positions with other countries
of the Global South on vital issues, and continue to work
for reform and empowerment of international organisa-
tions to deal with the major challenges that transcend
borders.

 

5. Enhanced foreign trade will be an important element
of our foreign policy and we will make every effort to
conclude long-pending trade negotiations with other
countries in the interests of Indian producers and
consumers.

6. Congress is implacably opposed to terrorism
anywhere in the world. We will work with other coun-
tries to eliminate terrorist groups, terrorist acts and
cross-border terrorism.

7. Congress will work to repair India’s international
image that has been damaged by the present govern-
ment’s intolerance of dissent and suppression of
human rights.

8. Congress recognises that national security is not
enhanced by chest-thumping or exaggerated claims
but by quiet attention to our borders and resolute
defence preparedness. We will work to restore the
status quo ante on our borders with China and to
ensure that areas where both armies patrolled in the
past are again accessible to our soldiers. We will take
the necessary steps to adjust our policy towards China
until this is achieved.

 

9. Congress will pay greater attention to our immediate
neighbours. We will re-establish the primacy of our
special relationships with Nepal and Bhutan and
strengthen them to our mutual benefit. We will enhance
economic and cultural relations between India and
Bangladesh that are the two most populous countries in
South Asia. We will work with Sri Lanka to restore the
political and commercial relations between the two
countries and help Sri Lanka resolve its political issues
especially with the Tamils. We will repair relations with
the Maldives and work with Myanmar to protect the
political and human rights of the people of Myanmar.

10. Engagement with Pakistan depends fundamentally
on its willingness and ability to end cross-border
terrorism.

11. Congress will significantly increase the size of the
Indian Foreign Service, open more missions abroad,
leverage our economic strengths, and acquire a
position of leadership through the country’s values and
mutually beneficial economic relationships.

12. We will revive the position of a Minister of State
handling overseas Indians within the External Affairs
Ministry to provide this important constituency with a
one-stop window to address their concerns.

Environment, Climate Change and Disaster Management

Congress re-affirms its profound commitment to rapid, inclusive and sustainable development, and to protect its
ecosystems, local communities, flora and fauna. We recall that it was Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who first put in
place the laws, regulations and institutions for that purpose. The National Action Plan on Climate Change was
prepared under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Despite the BUP’s misinformed criticism of the
Action Plan, the BJP/NDA government subsequently acknowledged its relevance and validity. However, there have
been several departures from the previous policies and important components such as environment protection,
forest conservation, biodiversity preservation, coastal zone regulation, wetlands protection and protection of tribal

rights have been weakened.

 

Air pollution and water pollution continue to extract a heavy toll on public health. Livelihoods are being destroyed in
tribal and ecologically sensitive areas.

Congress will address the issues of environment and climate change with the seriousness they deserve.

1. We will constitute an independent Environment
Protection and Climate Change Authority to establish,
monitor and enforce environmental standards and to
enforce the National and State Climate Change plans.

2. We will launch a Green New Deal Investment
Programme focused on renewable energy, sustainable
infrastructure and the creation of green jobs.

3. We will strengthen the National Clean Air
Programme in order to urgently tackle the problem of
air pollution.

4. Congress will work with state governments to stop
the discharge of effluents into the rivers and water
bodies of India.

 

5. Congress will appoint a high-level committee to study
the issue of landslides in the hill districts, evolve
measures to prevent landslides and ensure citizens’
safety.

6. Congress will protect the coastal zones of the
country. The coastal zones will be preserved without
affecting the livelihood of fishing communities.

7. India experienced the biggest loss of forest cover
after Brazil between 2015 and 2020. We will work with
state governments to increase the forest cover, redefine
‘forest’ and ‘forest cover’ in accordance with modern
scientific standards, and involve local communities in
afforestation.

8. Congress will provide clean cooking fuel at affordable
prices to all households of the country. We will ensure
that the use of LPG cylinders is increased from the
current paltry average number of 3.7 per year among
Ujjwala beneficiaries.

1. Congress will expand the remit of the Ministry of Jal
Shakti and bring all water-related activities and depart-
ments under one authority.

9. In order to facilitate the funding required for Green
Transition and to achieve the goal of net zero by 2070,
we will set up the Green Transition Fund of India
together with state governments and the private sector.

10. We will not limit disaster management to humans
and will expand it to include other vulnerable lives such
as wild animals, domestic animals, pets and livestock.

11. We will increase the allocation to the National
Adaptation Fund and review the guidelines for use of
the Fund.

12. We will transition from the 2008 National Action
Plan on Climate Change to a National Climate Resil-
ience Development Mission to ensure that all sectors
of development provide protocols for action and
measurable targets.

13. Conflicts between humans and wildlife have
increased. We will intervene and find solutions that are
specific to the areas of conflict.

 

2. We will implement a nationwide plan to provide
potable water in all cities, towns and village
panchayats.

 

3. Water harvesting will be made mandatory. Desalina-
tion plants will be installed in all coastal areas. The use
of recycled water will be promoted for non-drinking and
industrial purposes.

4. Congress will pay special attention to access to
water and democratic sharing of water. We will
address these issues by focusing on storage in dams
and water bodies, replenishing groundwater and
creating a large participatory programme of water
management involving the state governments, civil
society organisations, farmers, panchayats and gram
sabhas, and municipalities.

5. Our rivers are polluted because of the discharge of
effluents into the rivers. Discharge of any kind of
effluent into rivers will be prohibited by law. Pancha-
yats and municipalities will be required by law to devise
and implement schemes for disposal of effluents and
waste.

6. Congress will end the evil of manual scavenging.
Every manual scavenger will be rehabilitated, re-skilled,
provided a job and assured a life of dignity and safety.
The Prohibition of Manual Scavenging Act, 2013, will
be strictly implemented and any person employing
anyone for manual scavenging shall be punished. We
will provide compensation of €30 lakh to families of
sanitation workers deceased while at work. We will
allocate sufficient funds to enable the procurement of
machines that will clean sewers and septic tanks, and
remove human waste. Free insurance will be provided
to all sanitation workers.

AN APPEAL

 

The ten years of the BUP/NDA government have been marked by exaggeration and publicity rather than substance
and performance. The economy has registered less-than-satisfactory growth. Widespread unemployment, high
inflation and falling consumption have debilitated even this modest growth.

While the poor and the middle classes have been hit below the belt, the atmosphere in the country has become
hate-filled and divisive. Constitutional values have been pushed to the background and majoritarianism has taken
over.

Inequalities have widened. Every section of the people lives in fear.

What India and the Indian people need at this time is a decisive break from the path of the last ten years. The people
yearn to walk on the road of all-round development, equality, equity, freedom and justice. Congress has the capability
to provide the leadership to the people to walk on this new road.

The lessons of history are there before you. Congress delivered Independence. Congress laid the foundations of
democracy. Congress steered the country’s economic development through the 1950s and 1960s. Congress govern-
ments fought the wars of 1965 and 1971 and protected the sovereignty and integrity of India. Congress brought
about a paradigm change in 1991 and ushered in an era of impressive growth. In the last ten years, the Congress has
been the bulwark against illiberalism and authoritarianism. Congress has stood with the people in their fight against
injustice and oppressive laws.

Bearing in mind the lessons of history, the Congress appeals to you to repose your faith once again in the Indian
National Congress.

We promise you greater freedom, faster growth, more equitable development and justice for all. We appeal to you to
vote for the ‘Hand’ symbol and for the candidates of the Indian National Congress

It is time to remind ourselves of Tagore’s immortal words in Gitanjali:

Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
Where knowledge is free

Where the world has not been broken up into fragments

By narrow domestic walls

Where words come out from the depth of truth

Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way

Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit

Where the mind is led forward by thee

Into ever-widening thought and action

Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

THE OPEN MANIFESTO PROCESS:
PATHBREAKING POLITICAL REFORM

The Indian National Congress has pioneered an entirely new way in which
political party election manifestos are prepared. It is our firm belief that the
Indian National Congress Manifesto must reflect the voice and aspirations of
the people and a new vision for the country.

There were several consultations held across the country over a five-month
period (from October, 2013 to March, 2014) with different stakeholders, to
get their inputs on India’s future growth, development and inclusion agenda.
The Congress Vice President Shri Rahul Gandhi participated in several of
these interactions including those with representatives from Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, minorities, women organisations,
youth, labour, industry, Panchayat representatives, ex-servicemen, railway
porters, rickshaw pullers, salt-pan workers and farmers. In addition to this a
dedicated website (www.incmanifesto.in) was established to invite suggestions
from all citizens for the Manifesto. A separate website for the “National Student
Manifesto” was also created.

We received tens of thousands of suggestions through these consultations, on
the websites and social media platforms, phones, emails, etc. These suggestions
were carefully considered and have been included, wherever feasible.

We believe this unique exercise has made the Manifesto inclusive and fully
reflective of the voice of the people of India.

The Indian National Congress has made
seminal contributions to India’s unity,
integrity, secular polity and democratic
federalism. We have championed the rights
of the weaker sections, created conditions for
faster economic growth and have been the
principal instrument of social and economic
change, the preferred political choice for
crores of women and men.

Our central values resonate the very idea of
India, that has come to us over the centuries,
an India that rejoices in and celebrates
its many diversities, and builds on these
diversities to strengthen the bonds of unity
through secularism, pluralism, inclusion and
social justice. This is the India that
Mahatma Gandhi envisaged. This

is the India for which our Freedom

Fighters gave their all. This is the

India that the Indian National
Congress has always dedicated

itself to. Ours is the one Party with

a history of a liberal philosophy

that has enabled the country to

build strong political and economic
institutions and transform itself.

In the 1950’s, the Indian National

Congress put India on the path of

industrialisation through the public sector,
ensuring both rapid and balanced regional
growth across the face of our country.
A massive infrastructure for science and
technology was also established. In the 1960’s,
the Green Revolution was launched to make

India self-sufficient in food grains and a direct
assault on poverty. In the 1970’s, further gains
were made through the Green Revolution and
a White Revolution was unleashed that was
to make India the world’s largest producer of
milk. In the 1980’s, economic reforms were
launched in response to new challenges, to

modernise the Indian economy and bring
about the information and conmunications
technology revolution. In the 1990’s, radical
economic reforms were instituted leading to
accelerated economic growth and widespread
economic and social transformation. At the
turn of the millennium, we brought about
a “Regime of Rights” marking a paradigm
shift in India’s politics and development.
Beginning with the Right to Information,
Right to Work (Mahatma Gandhi National
Rural Employment Guarantee Act), Right to
Education and the Right to Food, we have
launched a radical progressive economic and
social development discourse.

regional balance, progress in backward
areas and a strong conviction that in order
to prosper every citizen must have the
opportunity to evolve to the best of her or
his ability. Ours is a Nation of incredible but
often untapped talent that needs and deserves
to be unleashed.

We envision an India where power would
have been devolved to the grassroots and to
the marginalized so that they can shape their
own destiny.

We envision an India charting a new future
rather than rewriting its past; living in
harmony, not in turmoil; thriving in peace

CONG RESS
HE ONL Y CHOIC

The depth and breadth of its political and
administrative experience makes the Indian
National Congress most intrinsically aware
and closely associated with the beliefs, and
ptinciples and need of the people of India.
We are the Party that has always believed in
the idealism and leadership abilities of the
youth. We have remained connected with
their aspirations and have been inspired by
their restless vibrancy.

Our vision is one of inclusive and sustainable
growth fuelled by agricultural development,

rather than suffering in conflict; imbued with
humility, not with arrogance.

We envision an India where the government
setves the people rather than where people
serve the government.

We believe in a simple universal truth: equity
and opportunity for all.

The Indian National Congress is the only
Party that believes that economic growth and

 

communal harmony, and economic growth
and social justice, are two sides of the same
coin and must always go hand-in-hand.

The Indian National Congress is the only
Party that combines experience and youth,
wisdom and exuberance, achievement and
ambition.

The Indian National Congress seeks a renewed
mandate on the strength of its heritage, its
record of service, both in and out of power,
and its clear vision for the future.

 

Sas it formation, 128 years ago,
the Indian National Congress has

spoken for every section of Indian

society and has mirrored India’s “unity
in diversity”.

The Indian National Congress’s
secular and liberal ethos has a place
for each and every Indian.

Ours is an inclusive vision.

The Indian National Congress stands
in sharp contrast to the divisive and
disruptive ideology of the BJP. We have
always been the secular and progressive
force in this country and strived to unite
all religions, castes and communities in the
ideological battle against those who would
polarize and divide our society.

Our democratic Constitution and
institutions are the cornerstone of Modern
India. All of us, who wish to build a better
India and rid the country of poverty and

Aware of the challenges thrown up by the
undemocratic and exclusionary politics of
the BJP, particularly in the recent past, the
Indian National Congress is committed
to confronting these challenges with
determination.

We do not respond by subverting
democratic institutions and blocking
Parliament session after session, year after
year. We do not respond by turning people
against each other and lighting the fires of
communal hatred. We do not respond by

 

Congress is the only natural choice for the

WE LET THE RECORD SPEAK FOR ITSELF.

 

The Congress-led UPA has brought 14
crore people out of poverty in the last
ten years. The rate of poverty decline
has tripled as compared to the preceding
decade. This is the greatest achievement of
the UPA governments, and we ate proud
of it.

In the ten years of UPA-I and UPA-II,
India achieved an average annual growth
rate of 7.5%. During the NDA tenure the
average annual growth rate was 5.9%.

Today, we produce 263 million tonnes of
food grains. Ten years ago, at the end of
the NDA tenure its was 213 million tonnes
of food grains.

Today, the installed power capacity is
234,600 MW. Ten years ago, it was less
than half at 112,700 MW.

Today, the number of mobile subscribers
has crossed 95 crore. Ten years ago, it was
a mere 3.36 crore subscribers. Telephone
density in rural areas has increased 26
times.

Today, coal production is 554 million
tonnes per year. Ten years ago, it was 361
million tonnes per year.

Today, we have 389,578 km of rural roads
under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak
Yojana (PMGSY). This is more than 7
times the 51,511 km of rural roads ten
yeats ago.

Today, the Cental Government’s spending
on healthcare is Rs. 36,322 crore, 5 times

more than the Rs. 7,248 crore it was ten
yeats ago.

Today, minorities have 43,52,000 bank
accounts in 121 districts of the country.
The total volume of lending stands at Rs.
66,500 crore. Ten years ago, minorities had
14,15,000 bank accounts. The total volume
of lending was just Rs. 4,000 crore.

Today, 41,16,000 women  Self-Help-
Groups have been credit linked to banks.
Ten years ago it was only 9,71,182.

Today, the total credit to small businesses

expenditure on education is Rs. 79,451
crore. Ten years ago, it was Rs. 10,145
crore.

Today, the total value of India’s international
trade stands at US $ 800 billion. Ten years
ago, it was US $ 142 billion.

 

he Indian National Congress-led UPA
government has had an unmatched record

when it comes to the passage of significant,
historic and pathbreaking legislation. The
Indian National Congress is a Party that takes
its commitments to the people as sacred.
The Party has worked to realise almost all
the promises made to the people in its earlier
Manifestos and campaigns:

1.

The Indian National Congress led
the charge to enact a unique and
unprecedented law to safeguard food
secutity for the poorest. The National
Food Security Act marked the realisation
of over a decade of work and has been
hailed as a visionary

law by the people.

The seminal Right to
Fair | Compensation
and Transparency in
Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act,
2013 - a key campaign
promise of the
Indian National Congress in 2009 - was
enacted after two years of nationwide
consultations. This law was a historic
victory for our brothers and sisters
working in the agriculture sector. The
law ensures that land cannot be acquired
without the land owners consent,
promises up to four times the prevailing
market value as compensation and repeals
the Land Acquisition Act of 1894.

The Indian National Congress led the way
in bringing about historic reform with
regard to women’s rights in the form of
the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2013
and the salutary Protection of Women

from Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act,
2013. These laws made the system more
sensitive to the challenges faced by our
women. Penalties have increased and new
crimes were included to make the definition
more women friendly so that the law better
serves the interests of the aggrieved.

In a bid to bring greater clarity on
the subject, the Congress-led UPA
Government enacted a new Companies
Act, 2013. This new law, resulting from
comprehensive consultations with all
stakeholders brings about radical changes
that will stimulate entrepreneurship,
make it easier to start new businesses

and Lokayukta Act, 2013 was born out
of a determination to give the people
a strong, independent authority to act
as a watchdog against administrative
corruption. This authority empowers the
people by giving them a high-powered
forum to tackle corruption in the
bureaucracy and the political system.

In one earliest actions on being re-elected,
the Congress-led UPA government
passed the Right of Children to Free and
Compulsory Education Act in 2009. This
law, which guarantees free education
in primary schools, also puts in place

2009 -2014

and encourage
Responsibility.

Corporate — Social

Mindful that our Nation’s citizens, and
particularly our senior citizens, deserve
greater security with regard to their
pension funds, the Congress-led UPA
Government enacted the Pension Fund
Regulatory and Development Authority
Act, 2013, to establish a regulator to
ensure these funds are protected from
unscrupulous individuals.

The Indian National Congress has always
looked to the people for guidance in
the discharge of its duties. The Lokpal

provisions for minimum standards for
the establishment of new neighbourhood
schools.

The Indian National Congress, which
has been firmly dedicated to the cause
of protecting our nation’s environment
and forests, enacted the National Green
Tribunal Act, 2009 to establish a special
fast track court to hear disputes related to
these issues.

The Indian National Congress piloted and
passed the Street Vendors (Protection of
Livelihood & Regulation) Act, 2014. This

10.

 

Act will protect livelihood rights of lakhs
of street vendors.

The Prohibition of Employment
as Manual Scavengers and _ their
Rehabilitation Act, 2013 not only
prescribes stringent punishment for
employing manual scavengers but also
has provisions for rehabilitation of these
families. An age-old blot on our society
will finally be erased.

LANDMARK LEGISLATION:

 

1. We will endeavour to bring around two-

thirds of our population — the skilled hands
that build India — into the middle class,
through a package of basic rights for all
workers — formal and informal, organized
and unorganized, regular and contractual.
Our aim will be to provide them and
all low-income families with economic
security and a minimum standard of living
to uplift their condition. The charter of
minimum socio-economic rights we will
put in place includes:

Right to Health

Right to Pension

Right to Homestead or Housing

Right to Social Security
Right to Dignity and
humane working
conditions

Right to Entrepre-
neurship that will
protect and assist all
those who seek to
become entrepreneurs

ene me

These new rights

will supplement the

other rights established under UPA-I
and UPA-II - Right to Food; Right to
Information; Right to Education; Right to
Employment; Rights to fight corruption
(Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act as well as
Whistleblower Protection Act); Right to
Identity (Aadhaar) and the Right to direct
receipt of welfare benefits (Aapka Paisa,
Aapke Haath — Direct Benefits Transfers).
Together, these rights will provide an
economic platform for people below the
middle class to transform their lives and
to transform India primarily through their
own effort, not through any handouts of
the government.

Al5

2. To support the Right to Health, the

Indian National Congress will increase
health expenditure to 3% of GDP and
provide universal and quality health care
for all Indians (including free medicines).
To support the right to homestead/
housing, we will ensure affordable and
quality housing for all. The Indira Awaas
Yojana and the Rajiv Awaas Yojana will be
expanded to cover all poor rural and urban
households.

. Continuing our record of delivering India’s

highest growth rates, we will restore India
to 8% plus growth rate within 3 years:

India a world leader in agricultural
production and agro-industry, taking
advantage of our national endowments
and the genius of our farmers. We
will focus on increasing agriculture
productivity and farmer incomes by
increasing investments in irrigation,
agricultural value chains, cold storage
and warehousing, etc.

f. We will introduce the Goods and
Services Tax Bills and a new Direct
Tax Code Bill in Parliament and ensure
they are enacted within one year.

1. A NEW FUTURE FOR
THE HANDS THAT BUILD
THE NATION

It is because of the Indian National Congress
that employees in the organised sector have
been fully protected through legislation and
are entitled to social security in different
ways. While organised sector employment
must expand, the reality is that employment
in the unorganised sector contributes close to
94% of India’s labour force.

In recent years, with the expansion of
employment opportunities because of rapid
economic growth, this segment has expanded.
In recognition of
this, in 2008, the
Congress-led UPA
government passed
the Unorganised
Workers’ Social
Security Act, 2008.

The Indian

National Congress

believes that it is time to scale up these
programmes across the country so that all
workers derive benefits from both legislation
and programmes in the next five years. To
ensute a basic tights and welfare package
for all working people, the Indian National
Congress will ensure:

1. Enforcement of Minimum Wage laws;
2. Provision of Pension cover;

3. Provision of life and disability cover,
health and maternity benefits — free
medicine, old age protection, Provident
Fund, employment injury benefit,

housing, education schemes for children,
and old age homes;

4. Creation of a working environment that
enables all such workers to carry out
work without harassment. We will also
ensure humane working conditions;

5. Strengthening of collective bargaining;

6. Programmes for upgrading skills and
income including use of improved
technology.

2. ECONOMIC GROWTH

The Indian National Congress is committed
to achieving 8 % growth per year, within
3 years, to be sustained over the next two
decades.

DETAILED ACTION PLAN

annum, compared to 5.9 % delivered by the
NDA, even as poverty has declined three times
faster. The growth under the Congress-led
UPA has been faster and more inclusive than
any earlier period in India’s history. And it is
not just the acceleration of growth that gives
the Indian National Congress satisfaction. In
keeping with the long-standing tradition of
the Indian National Congress, we have made
the growth process more socially inclusive
than it has ever been.

The UPA governments’ record on growth is
unparalleled.

2014 -2019

The Indian National Congress’s agenda is
one of social and economic transformation.
Growth is essential for this transformation
to happen and for it to be truly meaningful.
It is economic growth that creates jobs for
our youth. It is economic growth that gives
us the resources to invest in our social welfare
programmes and infrastructure development.
The nature and quality of growth is equally
important to ensure that the gains of growth
are equitably distributed.

Over the last ten years, the Congress-led UPA
governments have pursued and delivered
rapid and inclusive economic growth. We
have delivered economic growth of 7.5 % per

However, given the economic slowdown
in the last few years, driven by the global
financial crisis, bringing India back on track
to achieve 8% inclusive growth will be an
overriding priority of the next Congress-led
government.

An Economic Roadmap for 2014-2019

The Finance Minister in his budget speech
earlier this year has laid out a roadmap of ten
important tasks to be undertaken by the next
government. The Indian National Congress
affirms its commitment to this roadmap
which is outlined below:

i. Fiscal Consolidation: We will achieve the
target of fiscal deficit of 3 % of Gross

ii.

iii.

 

Domestic Product (GDP) by 2016-17,
and remain below that level always.
Current Account Deficit: Our Current
Account Deficit can be financed only by
foreign investment, whether it is Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) or Foreign
Institutional Investors (FH) or External
Commercial Borrowing (ECB) or any
other kind of foreign inflow. Hence,
there is no room for any aversion to
foreign investment.

Price Stability and Growth: In a
developing economy we must accept that
when our aim is high growth there will
be a moderate level of inflation. Reserve
Bank of India must strike a balance
between ptice
stability and growth
while formulating
monetary policy.

iv. Infrastructure:
We will rebuild
out infrastructure
and add a huge
quantity of new
infrastructure.
Every proven
model must be adopted. The Public
Private Partnership (PPP) model must be
made mote transparent and competitive
and more widely used. New financing
structures will be created for long term
funds and pooling of investments.
Manufacturing: We will focus on
manufacturing and especially on
manufacturing for export. We propose
that all taxes, Central and State, which
go into an exported product should
be waived or rebated. We also propose
that there should be a minimum tariff
protection so that there is an incentive to
manufacture goods in India rather than
import them into India.

 

vi.

vii.

viii.

ix.

Reforms: The
Financial
Sector Legislative Reforms Commission
that require no change in legislation must
be implemented immediately and, for the
other recommendations, we must draw a
timetable for passing legislation.
Subsidies: Given the limited resources,
and the many claims on the resources,
we must choose the subsidies that are
absolutely necessary and give them only
to the absolutely deserving. We will
also consider introducing sensible user
charges because many more people are
willing to pay for better quality services,
for example, uninterrupted power and
better quality

train setvices.

We will use
this money
saved to

expand health,

education and

infrastructure.

Urbanisation:

Our cities

will become

ungovernable, and perhaps unlivable, if
we do not address the decay in our cities.
Cities have wealth, cities also create
wealth. That wealth should be tapped for
resources to rebuild the cities with a new
model of governance.

Skill Development: Skill development
must rank alongside secondary education,
university education, total sanitation and
universal health care in the priorities of
the government.

Sharing responsibility between States and
Centre: States have the fiscal space to bear a
reasonable proportion of the financial costs
of implementing flagship programmes and
must willingly do so, so that the Central

Sector

Financial
recommendations of the

government can allocate more resources
for subjects such as defence, railways,
national highways and telecommunications
that are its exclusive responsibility.

The Indian National Congress’s
100 Day Agenda for Growth

While the above presents a medium-term
agenda for reform, the immediate priority is
to ensure that the economy gets back on track
to the target of 8 % growth.

While consolidating on the announcements
and progress made over the last year, we
commit to implementing the following

DETAILED ACTION PLAN

and entrepreneurship opportunities for
our youth.

Amend the Fiscal Responsibility and
Budget Management (FRBM) Act to
codify a credible commitment of the
government to achieve fiscal deficit
of 3 % of GDP by 2016-17, and stay
below that always. Set up an independent
National Fiscal Responsibility Council
that will submit an annual report to
the Parliament on the progress made in
achieving our fiscal commitments.

Building on the success of the Cabinet
Committee on Investment and the Project

2014 -2019

agenda within 100 days of forming the next
government:

1. Introduce the Goods and Services Tax
(GST) Bills in Parliament and ensure they
are enacted within 1 year. GST is likely to
increase the aggregate revenue which will
be used to fund the extra investment in
infrastructure, health and education.

2. Ensure that we are on track to pass a new
Direct Tax Code Bill in the first year of
the new Lok Sabha.

3. Announce a detailed Jobs Agenda to
ensure that we create 10 crore new jobs

Monitoring Group in clearing stalled
investment proposals, set up a National
Investment Facilitation Authority, a
permanent body headed by the Prime
Minister, and supported by a full-time
secretariat, with the explicit mandate of
identifying delayed projects and resolving
inter-ministerial issues to enable rapid and
transparent approvals to large projects,
especially in the infrastructure sector.

Bring a Bill to set up a National
Environmental Appraisal and Monitoring
Authority to conduct rigorous and time-
bound environmental appraisals and

 

recommend environmental clearances
where appropriate in a time-bound and
transparent manner.

7. Set up a Regulatory Reform Task Force
for a review of all regulatory processes
of central government ministries with
the intent of repealing unnecessary
processes, streamlining the regulatory
structures and improving ease of doing
business in India.

8. Put outa clear policy on tax treatment of
foreign firms and Merger & Acquisitions
(M & A) transactions while ensuring
that taxes are paid by multinational/
foreign entities in
the jurisdiction in
which the profits
are earned.

9. Lay out a

clear roadmap

for dealing with

immediate issues

of public sector

banks, — including
recapitalisation, Non-Performing Assets
(NPAs), operational autonomy, human
resource development and succession
planning in each bank.

10. Implement the recommendations of
the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms
Commission that require no change
in legislation and lay out a timeline for
passing required legislation.

Accelerating Job Creation and Skill
Development

The landmark ‘National Manufacturing
Policy’ of the UPA government brought the

 

agenda of job creation and manufacturing led
growth on the policy landscape. This policy
incorporates the agenda of creating 10 crore
jobs in the manufacturing sector alone within
one decade.

Today, two-thirds of Indians, nearly 80 crore
Indians, are below 35 years of age. Getting
well paying, decent jobs or entrepreneurship
opportunities as they enter working age, is
their number one priority. While a number of
steps have been taken in this direction in the
last decade, this remains an overriding national
priority, requiring a lot more to be done. The
Indian National Congress will announce a
Jobs Agenda within 100 days of forming the
government. This
agenda will include
the following
elements:

1. The Indian
National
Congress is
committed
to creation
of — industrial
corridors
to catalyze
economic growth and give a focused
thrust to manufacturing in the country.

2. Create 100 new urban clusters around
existing small and emerging cities and link
them with power and transport facilities
to scale existing economic activities.

3. Increase India’s investment rate to
38 % to ensure more new investments
are made to create jobs.

4. Improving India’s ‘Ease of Doing
Business’ tanking from the current 134
to 75 within 5 years, by streamlining the
process for starting a business, getting

various permits, easing access to credit,
streamlining the tax enforcement system,
and various other interventions.

Create an enhanced framework to
promote exports. Waive off all taxes,
Central and State, that go into exported
products. Put a minimum tariff
protection so that there is an incentive to
manufacture goods in India rather than
import them.

The Congress-led UPA government,
being fully aware of the importance of
skilling to increase employability set up
the National Skills Development Agency

and a robust monitoring system will be
put in place to track the manner in which
skills are imparted and certifications given
at the ground level under this scheme.

9. Community colleges stand at the
crosstoads of higher education and the
real world. We have begun a programme
to convert 200 existing educational
institutions into community colleges.
This will be completed within 5 years.

10. The Indian National Congress is committed
to the creation of new and upgrading
of existing Industrial Training Institutes
(ITIs). Recognising the need to have

2014 -2019

to coordinate various disparate training
efforts of different Central government
ministries, State governments, industry,
etc. We commit to increasing the
resources at its disposal and enhance its
mandate.

Reform the Apprentice Act, 1961, to
encourage mote firms to hire apprentices
in their firms, which has proven to be a
very effective way of providing “on-the-
job training” to new employees.

The Standard Training Assessment and
Reward (STAR) Scheme set up by the
UPA government will be better funded

quality world-class training methods and
infrastructure, we will introduce incentives
for Public Private Partnership and engage
world class expertise to ensure our youth
are best equipped to take on demanding
jobs in today’s globalized world.

3. PROTECTING THE
INTERESTS OF LABOUR
The Indian National Congress will extend

social security to the entire labour class, both
organised and unorganised.

 

The Indian National Congress has stood
for the cause and rights of labour. We have

 

enacted several laws to protect their interests
including the Unorganised Workers’ Social
Security Act. We will ensure the effective
implementations of all such laws.

1. The Indian National Congress will ensure
health insurance as well as pension cover
for this group.

2. The Indian National Congress is
committed to the strictestimplementation
of Contract Labour (Regulation
and Abolition) Act of 1970, to end
exploitation of workers and to improve
their welfare and working conditions.

3. We will focus
specially on

for protecting
the interests of

plantations, particularly those relating
to housing, will be addressed through
ongoing programmes.

6. The Unorganised Workers’ Social
Security Act, 2008 has been enacted; this
will be implemented in letter and spirit.

 

7. We will set up a Commission to explore
the possibility of bringing all Labour
Laws under one comprehensive Law.

4. RIGHT TO HEALTH

The Indian National Congress will increase
health expenditure to 3% of GDP and
provide universal and quality health care for
all Indians.

The Indian National Congress has endeavoured
to provide quality public health services to all
citizens. Its forward-looking Schemes have
achieved great success. This is reflected in the
decline in the Maternal Mortality Ratio and
Infant Mortality Rate. The Janani Suraksha
Yojana, a scheme
started to encourage
institutional delivery
has achieved great
success in increasing
the number of
beneficiaries from
7.3 lakh in 2005-06,
to nearly 113 lakh
ptegnant women in
2010-11.

1. We were the first party to implement
development policies as human tights. To
strengthen this framework, we now pledge
to enact a Right to Health to ensure that
all people obtain easily accessible, quality
health services, based on a combination
of public provision and social insurance.
The new National Health Mission will
emphasize both rural and urban health care.

2. We will provide for 5 state of the
art mobile health care vans in every
district, equipped with x-ray and other
equipment, to provide health care check
ups including, mammography, blood
tests, etc.

7.

The Indian National Congress will
expand the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima
Yojana to enable access to a continuum
of comprehensive primary, secondary
and tertiary care.

The Indian National Congress commits
itself to increasing the Institutional
Delivery Rate. Maternal and child health
care will also continue to be a major
focus. We aim to reduce the Infant
Mortality Rate and Maternal Mortality
Ratio drastically.

Almost 56% of adolescent girls in India are
anaemic. Anaemia and malnutrition among

comprehensive care and support to all
persons living with HIV/AIDS.

8. We will launch focused intervention to
improve the Child Sex Ratio, within an
overall “National Strategy for Care and
Protection of the Girl Child” from birth
to adolescence.

9. Health and Family Welfare Programmes

will be strengthened to achieve a Total
Fertility Rate (TFR) of 2.1 between 2017
and 2020. Particular attention will be paid
to regions which still have a high TFR
(above 2.5).

mothers endanger the mother’s health and
causes growth retardation and vulnerability
to diseases in children. This is not just a
socio-economic challenge; it is a political
challenge to which the Indian National
Congress reaffirms its commitment.

Almost 60% of open defecation in the
world takes place in India. Poor sanitation
is a serious health hazard. We will
endeavour to provide a functional toilet
in every school and every household.

There has been a reduction of new HIV
infections in the country by 57%. We
aim to reduce this further and provide

10. India’s success in becoming polio-free
through vaccination will be replicated.
Our goal is to ensure universal coverage
of routine immunization through
campaigns and effective monitoring in
districts throughout the country.

11. To ensure effective implementation
of all health telated initiatives, we
will work to strengthen the primary
health workforce including Accredited
Social Health Activists (ASHAs),
Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs),
Male Multipurpose Workers (MMWs),

 

Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and
Community Health Officers etc. We
will work to fill the current vacancies
and improve their competencies
through nationwide capacity building
programmes linked to the National
Health Mission.

12. We will create 60 lakh new jobs in the
health sector by 2020 by training
and expanding the current teaching
programmes for healthcare professionals,
particularly in the public sector
institutions. We will start a three-year
Diploma Course in Public Health.

5. EMPOWERING SCHEDULED
CASTES, SCHEDULED TRIBES
AND OTHER BACKWARD
CLASSES

The Indian National Congress will continue
to work towards the empowerment of the
marginalised sections of society.

The principles of equity and inclusion have
been weaved into the very fabric of the
Indian National Congress. It is because of the
initiatives of the Indian National Congress
that the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes
and Other Backward Classes have seen

 

an improvement in key socio-economic
indicators. In fact the annual rate of decline

for poverty in the period between 2004—05
and 2009-10 has been much higher than
between 1993-94 and 2004-05 for Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

The Indian National Congress has enacted
several laws for the weaker sections including
the Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation
Act, 2013 to push for rehabilitation of
these families. The Constitution (117th
Amendment) Bill 2012 to provide reservation
in promotions for Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes has been passed by the Rajya
Sabha. We will continue to fight the deep-
seated prejudices,

traditional

hierarchies and
disparities faced
by these sections,

socially, politically
and economically.

1.

The Indian

National

Congress is

committed to

finding a way forward for introducing
reservation in education and employment
for economically weaker sections of all
communities without in any way affecting
existing reservations for Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other
Backward Classes.

We now pledge to enact central legislation
on the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes Sub Plans so that the development
of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes can be accelerated to become at
par with other Castes.

The Indian National Congress will
ensute the passage of the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention
of Atrocities) Amendment Bill, 2013.

With a strong focus on education and
vocational skills, we will endeavour to
establish one Navodaya Vidyalaya type
of school of high standards for weaker
sections, in every Block of the country.

We will continue to provide assistance
to fund the cost of education in both
ptivate and government institutions for
Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe
students, with priority to those students

pay for the appropriate skill development
coutse.

The Indian National Congress has ensured
the reservation of 4% of procurement
from small and medium Scheduled Caste
and Scheduled Tribe enterprises. We
will push for strict implementation of
this norm.

The Indian National Congress,
recognizing that dalit women are more
socially and economically vulnerable, has
endeavored to work for their upliftment
and welfare and will continue to ensure
dignity through economic and _ social
empowerment.

All Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe
students fulfilling the admission criteria
will be provided with universal access to
the Rajiv Gandhi Research Fellowships.
In addition, 1000 overseas scholarships
for eligible students will be provided
annually.

Every Scheduled Caste or Scheduled
Tribe unemployed graduate or post
graduate will be provided with a Skill
Development Voucher of Rs. 10,000 to

We will focus on development activities
for creating social and economic
opportunities for Scheduled Tribes. We
will ensure the stringent implementation
of PESA, 1996 and the Forest Rights
Act, 2006 to ensure that Scheduled
Tribes are empowered and brought into
the mainstream.

The Indian National Congress is
committed to creating national consensus
on affirmative action for Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the
ptivate sector.

We will take steps to ensure that all
reserved posts ate filled and a special drive
will be undertaken to fill all the backlog
vacancies in reserved posts in government
and Public Sector Undertakings.

The Indian National Congress is deeply
committed to developing a National
Action Plan for the Development of
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and
Other Backward
Classes. There shall
be a special survey,
which will be
undertaken once
evety five years
to estimate, on
select development
indicators, the gap
in the development
of these groups.

The Indian National Congress will
ensure that the existing Rajiv Gandhi
National Fellowship for Scheduled Caste
and Scheduled Tribe Candidates will be
extended to students belonging to Other
Backward Classes.

The Indian National Congress will
establish Special Commissions for
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes

and Other Backward Classes to identify
communities within each group which
have not benefited from reservations and
other affirmative action programmes and
which need to be given a special focus.

 

6. WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT
AND PROTECTION OF
CHILDREN

The Indian National Congress will ensure

the safety and security of our women and

children. We will provide them equal access to
social, economic and political opportunities.

The Indian National Congress is a party that
has gone beyond the rhetoric and hyperbole
relied on by most parties when it comes to
the empowerment of women and children.
The Indian National Congress has enacted
several women and child oriented Acts,
including the Criminal Law (Amendment)
Bill, 2013, the
Sexual Harassment
of Women at
Workplace (Prevention,
Prohibition and
Redressal) Act,2013,
the Criminal Law
(Amendment) Act,
2013, Commission
for Protection of
Child Rights Act,
2005, and the Protection of Children from
Sexual Offences Act, 2012. We have also
ensured that gender equality and child care
facilities are mainstreamed in government
schemes like MGNREGA. We will continue
to work for the development our women and
children.

1. The Indian National Congress will ensure
that all laws for the welfare of children
including the Child Labour (Prohibition
and Regulation) Act and the Protection
of Children from Sexual Offences Act,
2012, will be strictly enforced.

We will further strengthen and expand
the scope of the National Commission
for Protection of Child Rights, set up in
2007.

We will also ensure that the strongest
possible action is taken to prevent child
trafficking.

The quality of the Integrated Child
Development Scheme (ICDS)
programme will be vastly improved
and special incentives will be given to
Anganwadi workers.

Fast-Track Courts will be established
with ‘in-camera’ proceedings facilities
in State headquarters and in regional
centres. The purpose of these Courts
will be solely to address crimes against
women. Mandatory procedure for the
rapid conclusion of cases where custody
of children is involved shall be put in
place.

We will increase the number of girls
hostels, particularly in tribal areas and
hostels for working women, with day care,
to encourage women to become well-
educated and earn theit own livelihood.

2014 -2019

The Indian National Congress is
committed to the enactment of the
Women’s Reservation Bill to reserve
33 % of all seats in the Lok Sabha, and in
all State legislative assemblies for women.

We will initiate immediate action to
formulate a Citizens Charter for Women’s
Safety and Security.

The Indian National Congress has placed
a high premium on the education of
women. We will continue with this focus,
to achieve gender parity in literacy.

10. We will ensure that all measures are taken

11.

to make women feel safe and protected.
We will expedite such measures as the
creation of functional helplines in all
major towns and cities and rural areas for
prompt grievance redressal for women,
exclusive 24-hour transport facilities and
gender sensitivity classes for police men
and women, particularly in registering
and investigating complaints made by
women.

The Indian National Congress will open
“One Stop Crisis Centres” for women in
all hospitals to provide medical, legal and

12.

15.

 

psycho-social aid in cases of rape and
domestic violence against women.

The Indian National Congress, true to its
long-standing history, will take measures
to enable increased participation and
reservation for women at all levels within
the government. We will ensure that at
least 25% of the total police officers, sub-
inspectors and constables at every police
station in the country will be women,
over the next five years. We will ensure
the number of women police stations in
the country goes up from 500 to 2000 in
the next five years.

unorganised sector in peri-urban and
rural areas.

18. The Indian National Congress is deeply
distressed with the continued sexual
exploitation of tribal girls at various
places, such
as hostels,
and continued
trafficking in T H E
young women
belonging
to tribal
communities.
This matter
will receive
the highest
priority and will be taken up with all State
governments and special Schemes will be
introduced, like through the National
Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) for
securing their livelihoods.

19. The Indian National Congress will work
with women’s Self-Help-Groups for the
distribution of free sanitary napkins for
adolescent girls.

20. The Indian National Congress believes
that society should be more sensitive to
the rights of the transgender community.
This issue will receive separate and
continued attention.

21. Through the NRLM we will provide
low interest loans, of upto Rs. 1 lakh, to
women for livelihood activities.

7. SAFEGUARDING MINORITIES

The Indian National Congress will focus on
accelerating concrete, sustainable and long-
term plans for the welfare of the Nation’s
minorities.

The Indian National Congress has always
been at the forefront in promoting Schemes
for the welfare of minorities. A separate and
dedicated Ministry of Minority Affairs was
established under the Congress-led UPA-I

DETAILED ACTION PLAN

‘Priority Sector Lending’ disbursement
for minorities has steadily increased. We
will continue to ensure that members
of the minority communities have easy
access to credit and other incentives
like tax rebates etc, to encourage
entrepreneurship.

For the effective management of Waqf
properties and in realisation of the specific
promise made in 2009, the Congress-
led UPA government became the first
government to pass a law providing clear
guidelines to prevent the usurpation and
mismanagement of Waqf properties.
The Indian National Congress pledges to
continue with this programme.

2014 -2019

government. Since then many far-reaching
programmes in various sectors have been
implemented with significant results.

1. Numerous scholarships have been
distributed to children belonging to the
minority community. The Corpus of the
Maulana Azad Education Foundation has
been more than tripled to over Rs 700 crore
in an attempt to encourage candidates
from the minority communities to pursue
opportunities in higher education. This
work will be continued so as to ensure
that no child who applies for educational
support is denied it at any level.

The Prevention of Communal and
Targeted Violence (Access to Justice
and Reparations) Bill, 2013, which was
drafted and introduced by the Indian
National Congress will be passed as a
matter of priority.

The Congress-led UPA government has
taken steps to address the conditions
of backward minorities by aiming to
provide them reservation in educational
institutions and in government
employment. We will pursue this matter
closely in Court and ensure that the
policy is implemented through proper
legislation.

 

6. We will work to create a ready corpus,
along the lines of the Maulana
Azad Educational Fund for young
entrepreneurs. Skills development
programmes for minorities which have
been carried out successfully in various
districts, will be implemented across the
country.

7. While much work has been done to
implement the recommendations of the
Sachar Committee, the Indian National
Congress will work tirelessly to ensure
that every single recommendation is
reviewed and efforts are made for their
implementation.

8. YOUTH AND

STUDENT
AGENDA

The Indian National
Congress will

continue to focus
on youth capacity
building, education,
leadership and
development. Opening up the political system
and giving a voice to each and every young
Indian will continue to be a priority area.

The Indian National Congress believes our
youth is our biggest asset. In the past decade
not only have we actively encouraged young
leadership and political opportunities for all
but also remained committed to creating an
enabling and rewarding environment to build
the capacity of our youth to take on roles more
actively in our country’s future. We spend more
than Rs. 90,000 crore across various schemes
for the youth, and we will only increase this.

 

Building the Best Education System
in the World for our Students

The Indian National Congress has been
unequivocal in its emphasis and support for
providing affordable and quality education.
We will continue to keep education on the
very top of our development agenda.

Education is the backbone of human
development and is vital to ensuring equal
social, political and economic opportunities
for all citizens. We enacted the Right to
Education Act 2009, which provides for
free and compulsory education for children
between the ages of 6 and 14 years. As a
result, enrolment
of children at the
ptimary education

stage has now
reached near
universal levels.

1.98 lakh primary

schools and 1.1

lakh upper primary

schools have been

constructed. Under

UPA-I and UPA-

II, the per capita public expenditure on
education increased from Rs. 888 in 2004-05
to Rs. 2,985 in 2011-12. Our focus will now
be on improving the quality of education- we
will move from “Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan” to
“Shreshth Shiksha Abhiyan.”

1. The Indian National Congress will
strengthen the implementation of
the Right to Education Act to ensure
quality learning outcomes, adequate
infrastructure and facilities in schools,
regular teacher training and an optimal
Pupil Teacher Ratio. We will also ensure
quality in teacher training by making

suitable investments and amendments to
regulations, wherever required.

We will enhance focus and resources
on the implementation of the Rashtriya
Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, to improve
quality of secondary education. We will
achieve near universal enrolment in
secondary education.

The Indian National Congress will place
a special emphasis on reducing the
drop-out rate particularly in middle and
secondary levels.

7. The Indian National Congress will take
systematic steps to address issues relating
to discrimination against students from
the North East and Jammu and Kashmir.

8. We will continue to place a special focus
on ensuring educational access to civil
sttife affected areas and the North East
region.

9. To focus on higher education, we

launched the Rashtriya Uchhatar Shiksha
Abhiyan (RUSA) to provide strategic
funding to improve college and university
infrastructure. RUSA will help create 70
new universities, provide infrastructure in

disabilities. We will also award priority to
developing infrastructure for differently-
abled persons.

current universities, upgrade autonomous
colleges to Universities, and create a new
model of general degree colleges and
professional institutions.

10. The Indian National Congress will set up
a “National Commission for Students’, a
body which will protect and promote the
interests of students. This Commission
will review Constitutional and legal
safeguards for students, recommend
remedial legislative measures, facilitate
redressal of grievances and advise
the government on all policy matters
concerning students.

 

11. The Indian National Congress will
continue to expand its support to
providing interest-free educations loans
to students at all levels especially to the
weaker sections of society.

12. The Indian National Congress is
commited to exploring the possible
partnerships with the private sector in
the delivery of education. New Public
Private Partnership models will be
explored and appropriate regulatory
systems, accreditation —_ procedures,
policies and incentives will be developed,
to enable private education providers
to take on the challenge of expanding
and improving secondary education, in

particular.

13. Indian National
Congress will
establish a “National
Youth Commission’,
which will be a
professional and
dedicated focal
point for youth
development in all
aspects.

14. We will establish a centralised students
exchange ptogramme to encourage
National unity.

Promoting Sports

The Indian National Congress remains
committed to ensuring that sports
opportunities are expanded and made more
available and accessible to the youth.

We will strive to be a Nation where sport in
all its forms is promoted and encouraged.

1. Due to the UPA-II’s recent efforts, India
has been reinstated as a member of the

 

International Olympic Committee. The
Indian National Congress will continue
to clean up sports administration. We
will ensure active involvement of former

sportspersons in sports administration.

2. The Rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan launched
by the Congress-led UPA government
will be implemented to ensure high
quality sporting facilities in every block
of the country.

3. A“National Sports Education University”
will be set up to educate students of
exceptional talent. There would be a team
of experts who would be continuously
scouting for
talent in every
sport across
the country in
the age-group
of 8-15 years.
It will have

world class
coaches and
facilities.

Other Youth Issues

The Indian National Congress will promote
social inclusiveness, employability and
entrepreneurship development among the
youth,

1. The Indian National Congress will
provide a special youth development
package (entrepreneurship/employment)
for Left-Wing Extremism affected
areas with special focus on women and
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

2. Wewillstart a special drive for recruitment
of North East and Jammu & Kashmir

youth in Railways, Indian Army and other
Central government departments.

The Indian National Congress remains
committed to eradicating the problem of
drug abuse. A nation-wide assessment of
the prevalence of this problem will be
undertaken. Funding will be adequately
provided for drug-rehabilitation centres
which will be set up in each district.

The National Service Scheme, launched
by the Congress-led UPA government
for graduates, aims to enhance IT literacy,
financial literacy, english communication
and other soft skills; to make the youth

9. RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND
PANCHAYATI RAJ
The Indian National Congress will continue

to work progressively to ensure the prosperity
of rural India.

 

In the ten years of UPA-Iand UPA-II, the rural
areas of the country have seen unprecedented
economic development and improvement in
quality of life. For the first time in over two
decades, the increase in rural consumption, at
18%, has outpaced urban consumption. Rural
poverty declined at 0.7 percentage points
per year between 1993-94 and 2004-05. It
declined more than three times faster at 2.3

2014 -2019

more employable. The Indian National
Congress is committed to increasing
funding and reach of this Scheme while
prioritising its implementation.

We will seek to ensure priority to
differently-abled youth with respect to
education and employment opportunities.
We will set up government run
employment exchange/ facilitation
centers for youth seeking foreign
employment opportunities. These will
help curtail middlemen/fraudulent
recruiting agencies. The Ministry of
Overseas Indian Affairs will be the nodal
agency for this.

percentage points per year in the UPA period
between 2004-05 and 2011-12.

Farm wages in teal terms increased
impressively after 2004 to teach Rs.184.7
per day in 2012-13. Our flagship and
historic programme, the Mahatma Gandhi
National Rural Employment Guarantee
Act (MGNREGA) has been a significant
contributor in this; on an average 1 in every
4 rural households has sought work under
MGNREGA every year.

1. All development functionaries at the
village level who perform vital nation-
building tasks like Anganwadi workers,
Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs),

 

Accredited Social Health Activist
(ASHA) workers and various others,
must have their contributions recognised
in a meaningful manner. The Indian
National Congress will ensure that they
are compensated adequately for their
services and have access to high quality
training and decent working conditions.

The Indian National Congress fulfilled its
promise and implemented the National
Food Security Act, a statutory guarantee
to ensure adequate quantity and quality
of food at affordable prices to people
to live their life with dignity. The Indian
National Congress will attempt to

expand the focus

of the current food

security Schemes to

THE DETAILED ACTION PLAN | #25

oil for beneficiaries
of Antyodaya Anna
Yojana.

3. The Indian
National Congress will implement a
Universal Pension Scheme, for the elderly,
destitute, widows and other similar
groups (based on certain exclusions).

We will expand the current Pradhan
Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)
to ensure that an all-weather road will
connect all habitations with a population
of 125 persons and above.

To promote effective access to clean
drinking water and water for irrigation,
we will set up a legal and institutional
framework, in discussion and with
consensus of States, for water. We will

 

also ensure 100% coverage of rural
habitations for drinking water in the next
five years.

We will continue to support Self-Help-
Groups (SHGs) and assist the poor
to set up small businesses. We will set
up more branches of the Bharatiya
Mahila Bank and women only branches
of other public sector banks. Our
target is to ensure the formation of
7 crore SHGs by 2019.

The Indian National Congress will ensure
100% modernisation and digitisation of
land records to ensure transparency in

land titles.

The Indian
National
Congress will
substantially
increase
Panchayat
funding,
especially of
untied funds. We
will also encourage Panchayats to raise
their own resources so that Panchayat
representatives, in consultation with Gram
and Ward Sabhas, can themselves decide
how and on what to spend their money.

We will set up a “National Panchayati

Raj Commission”, with branches in each

State and Union Territory, so that:

a. Probity and transparency is ensured
in the functioning of Panchayats and
their elected representatives;

b. Panchayati Raj functions in line with
the Constitution and the laws of the
land, especially in tribal areas covered
by Panchayat Extension to Scheduled
Areas Act (PESA);

c.Gram Sabhas are strengthened and
legally mandated to secure responsible
and responsive local government;

d. The individual citizen is empowered to
secure, through the local Panchayat,
his or her tights and entitlements and
other benefits provided for in the
Constitution.

 

10. AGRICULTURE AND FARMER

WELFARE

The Indian National Congress will continue
to provide an impetus to agricultural growth,
productivity and incomes. We will also stay
focused on providing all possible support for

facilities and ware housing. It will ensure
that the farmer gets a much higher value
for her or his produce.

We will continue to nurture Public
Private Partnerships for increasing
investments in value-chains, cold storage
facilities, grading and standardisation,
quality certification and warehouses. This
will greatly aid in increasing agriculture
productivity and exports.

We will add 1 crore hectares to irrigated
area by completing the radical Water
Reforms Agenda of the 12th Plan, which
is based on Irrigation Management

our farmers, in particular women and small
and marginal farmers.

The Indian National Congress has instituted
schemes like the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas
Yojana. As a result of these measures, the
agriculture GDP growth went up from 2.6%
(under the NDA) to 3.1% under UPA-I and
further to 4% under UPA-II.

1.

The historic decision by the Congtress-
led UPA government to allow Foreign
Direct Investment in multibrand retail
will transform the agrarian economy as
it will create a beneficial value chain from

farm-to-fork, creating rural infrastructure
for sorting, grading, packing, cold storage

Transfer to Water Users Associations of
farmers. This will ensure Gross Irrigated
Area crosses 10 crore hectares in India.

The current water use efficiency in
irrigation is 40%. The Indian National
Congress will actively support more
efficient water use technologies including
reuse and recycling of water. We will
complete the historic aquifer-mapping
and the groundwater management
programme launched by UPA-II over
the next five years, to ensure sustainable
utilisation of groundwater to secure
the livelihoods of lakhs of our farmers,

 

particularly in regions where groundwater
depletion has taken place.

Small and marginal farmers own more
than half the country’s total cattle and
buffalo. However, only 12% of the total
expenditure on agriculture is on livestock
development. The Indian National
Congress will place a special emphasis on
livestock, fisheries, opening of veterinary
schools and centres, fodder development
through animal husbandry programmes
and schemes’ like MGNREGA.
MGNREGA will also be harnessed to
support the construction of poultry
shelters and water bodies for fisheries.

6. The Indian
National Congress
willincrease spending

to ensure access and
quality in agriculture
education, including
increasing the
amount for and
number of  post-
matric scholarships
and research fellowships for veterinary
students.

The Indian National Congress will
increase coverage of crop insurance
schemes, particularly among the small
and marginal farmers and non-loanee
farmers. Settlement of claims on time,
better crop yield estimation to determine
premiums etc., and involvement of
private sector will be other areas of focus.

The Indian National Congress will
allocate special funds for agricultural
research to develop new technologies

13. The Indian National Congress has more
than doubled the Minimum Support
Prices (MSP) for farmers for wheat and
paddy from 2004-05 to 2013-14. The MSP
for other cereals increased three-fold. We
will continue our endeavour to provide
higher MSP to increase profitability of
agriculture for our farmers.

14. The Indian National Congress will
provide concessional loans to groups/
collectives of small and marginal farmers
and women farmers upto Rs. 5 lakh to

that the interface between government
and industry is simplified and will usher
in comprehensive regulatory changes in
this regard. This will include optimising
the use of electronic platforms and
minimising human interface wherever
possible. Redundant procedures will be
weeded out and the E-biz Project will be
implemented across the country, which
will ensure ‘single window electronic
clearances’ platform for all investors,
embracing in its fold all regulatory
approvals of the Central and State
governments.

strengthen multilateral trade systems and
investment flows for future prosperity.
The Congress-led UPA government has
embarked on a path of greater economic
integration. The trade in goods and
services has exceeded US$ 1 trillion and
we will ensure that this gets doubled
within a period of 5 years.

12. INFRASTRUCTURE

The Indian National Congress is of the

in tural areas. We will continue to invest

in creating an extensive and world-class
transportation network which will connect
people across the country.

1. The Indian National Congress will launch
a “National Road Transport Safety
Programme”. Road Accidents will be
halved within five years by strong willed
political commitment to this Programme.
The Programme will make every possible
effort to change the road safety culture
while establishing clear road safety norms.

2. The Indian National Congress recognizes
that the Indian Railways is the lifeline of
the Nation and is committed to railway

2014 -2019

firm belief that infrastructure will serve as
the backbone of India’s growth. We pledge
to spend $1 trillion on upgrading India’s
infrastructure in the coming decade.

‘Transport

India is growing very rapidly and transport
is a foundational pillar of that growth. The
Indian Railways is the world’s largest rail
network and currently carries 822.4 crore
people a year. During the UPA government,
the total goods carried by the railways doubled
to 1 billion tonnes. The Congress-led UPA
governments have built or upgraded 17,394
km of highways. There has been a ten-fold
increase in investment in road construction

modernisation. We will ensure effective
implementation of the recommendations
of the Sam Pitroda Committee.

3. The Indian National Congress will ensure
that all million-plus cities ate covered by
High Speed Rail.

4. We have begun work on the Western and
Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridors,
which will revolutionise freight, transport
in India, making it more efficient. The
Indian National Congress is committed
to ensuring these projects are completed
in a time-bound manner.

 

5. We have over the last decade, used the
Public Private Partnership model to unveil
world-class airports in Delhi, Mumbai,
Hyderabad and Bangalore and _ the
Airports Authority of India has upgraded
several others. As the demand for air
travel is increasing tremendously, we will
upgrade and create new infrastructure for
ait travel across the country.

6. The Indian National Congress will ensure
adequate funding and timely development
of Regional Rapid Transit Systems.
The work of preparation of Feasibility
Studies of Regional Rapid Transit System
(RRTS) corridors for the three prioritized

corridors: Delhi-

Sonipat-Panipat,

Delhi-Gurgaon-

Rewari-Alwar, Delhi-

Ghaziabad-Meerut is

already being done.

We will ensure these

are fast-tracked.

7. Weare committed

to investing in

and upgrading the
logistics, infrastructure and development
of the port sector in India. We will
continue to work in this direction.

8. The Indian National Congress will
emphasise development of India’s inland
waterways, which totals about 14,500 kms
in length, along with coastal shipping.
We will work to set up terminals at major
ports and providing adequate road and rail
connectivity to inland water and coastal
terminals and non-major coastal ports.

Energy

India’s power generation capacity more than
doubled to 2.34 lakh MW over the past

 

decade. To promote equitable and inclusive
access to energy, we have recently increased
the number of subsidised cooking gas
cylinders per household to 12 per year. The
Indian National Congress will continue to
enable the provision of clean, efficient and
affordable energy for all.

1. The Indian National Congress is
committed to the establishment of a
clearly defined policy for fair, transparent
equitable and time bound development
of natural resources. The Indian National
Congtess will immediately put in place a
Special Purpose Vehicle for this which will
be responsible for a judicious allocation,
of resources on the basis of usage and
not arbitrarily,
while striking
a balance
between
ptesent
requirements
and future
demands.
We will also
ensure that an
independent
regulator monitors the process of natural
resource allocation, in a manner that best
serves the interests of the Nation.

2. We will effectively implement the
National Mission on Energy Efficiency to
improve energy efficiency in all areas of
the economy including power, transport,
urban housing, consumer goods and in
rural housing,

3. We will work to ensure greater access to
electricity; 100% access in urban from
current 94% and 90% access in rural
areas from current 67.3% under the Rajiv

Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana

(RGGVY).

4. We are mindful of the fact that while
we have worked to increase access to
electricity, its availability remains an
atea of concern. The Indian National
Congress will work to improve the quality
and unit consumption of electricity in
rural areas.

5. Women being the main energy users
and primary energy suppliers are worst
affected by restricted LPG supply. There
still exists a strong disparity between
urban and rural areas. We need to work

commitment to creating inclusive cities,
revamping urban governance, increasing
low-income housing, and making large
investments in infrastructure.

With the 74th Amendment to India’s
Constitution devolving power to urban
local bodies, and through the Jawaharlal
Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission
(JNNURM), we have given a major impetus
to urban development in India.

30 crore Indians currently live in towns and
cities. Within 20-25 years, another 30 crore
people will get added to this. Recognising the
challenges of urbanisation ahead, the Indian

to LPG and kerosene, especially the
availability to rural households.

6. We will give a new thrust to new and
renewable energy, including hydel, solar
and nuclear energy.

7. We will ensure accelerated implemented
of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar
Mission and launch a “National Wind
Energy Mission”.

13. URBAN DEVELOPMENT

The Indian National Congress affirms its

National Congress is committed to adopting
a proactive approach to address them.

1. The Indian National Congress will ensure
that Mayors and Municipal Chairpersons
have fully functional powers, so that they
can operate as Chief Executives Officers
of cities with executive powers and
responsibilities and not just ceremonial
positions. We will also increase the tenure
of Mayors.

2. Urban constituencies are rapidly growing
in population and the disparity between
constituencies is increasing. This
undermines the principle of equality of

 

vote and also results in under-franchise
of urban areas. We will ensure this issue
is revisited so that constituencies can be
adjusted to reflect population changes.

3. JNNURM was a landmark initiative
undertaken by the Congress-led
government; it put the urban agenda
centrestage with major investments in
urban infrastructure. We also launched
a revamped JNNURM-II with more
funding and more powers to local
governments. JNNURM-II is giving
priority to the strengthening of humanand
institutional capabilities, local planning

and improvement
in governance. We
continue to

14. HOUSING

The Indian National Congress will continue
to work towards providing affordable and
quality housing for all sections

 

1. The Indira Awaas Yojana will be expanded
to cover all poor rural households.
Financial assistance for this will include
money to not only construct a pucca
house but also individual sanitary toilets
and drinking water connections.

2. For urban areas, the Rajiv Awaas Yojana
will be expanded to cover all poor urban
households. The Scheme is expected to

 

cover 250 cities by the end of the 2017.
Funds have already been released to
162 cities for undertaking preparatory
activities under Slum Free City Planning
Scheme. Our priority will be time-bound
implementation of this initiative.

3. We will endeavour to ensure a Right to
Homestead for all poor households.

4. We will endeavour to ensure Title Deeds

are given to those who have been living
on lands for more than two decades.

15. ENVIRONMENT

 

The Indian
National Congress
is committed
oO sustainable

development in its
tue spirit. We will
continue to accord
he highest priority
oO — environmental
protection and
o ensure that all
people in India have the right to a clean
environment, which secures their health,
ivelihood and nutritional well-being,

The Indian National Congress has always
prioritised conservation of our national
environment. It was Smt. Indira Gandhi
who raised the importance of this agenda
as the only visiting Head of State at the UN
Conference on Human Environment, 1972.
The Indian National Congress has enacted
vatious laws for envitonmental protection,
including the National Green Tribunal Act,
2010.

 

1. The Indian National Congress will bring
a Bill to set up a National Environmental
Appraisal and Monitoring Authority

(NEAMA) - a professional agency
to conduct figorous and __ time-
bound environmental appraisals and
recommend envitonmental clearances,
where appropriate, in a time-bound and
transparent manner.

We will put water conservation at the heart
of our programmes for agriculture, rural
and urban development. This will be done
by focusing all current programmes on
augmenting water through decentralized
systems, conserving water through all
means and promoting recycling and reuse
of water in all sectors. Water is a public
right, but also a public responsibility.

An overwhelming number of women,
especially in rural India still use polluting
biomass for cooking, which puts an
unbearable health burden on them. The

Indian National Congress is committed
to providing clean cooking fuel across
the country in an accelerated manner in
order to address this.

We will launch “Green National
Accounts” by 2016-17, to ensure that
the costs of environmental degradation
are clearly reflected in India’s national
accounts. We will also develop indicators
that will provide data to the public on the
state of our natural resources.

THE DETAILED ACTION PLAN

2014 -2019

We believe that while pricing of water
must ensure that users internalise ethics
of conservation, it is also imperative
that it be sustainable and affordable.
We will promote these principles in all
our programmes for water and waste
management.

The Indian National Congress will take
up the cleaning of rivers on a large
scale. The National Ganga River Basin
Authority has begun the ambitious task
of cleaning the Ganga River. We will use
similar models of creating empowered,
well-funded agencies to clean other
major rivers in the country.

We will engage tribal and forest-dwelling
communities more centrally in forest
management, and ensure they get
benefits from forest produce, including
bamboo and other non-timber forest
produce. We will ensure that revenues
from forest-based activities, including
from wildlife tourism, are shared with
local communities. This will serve as a
bedrock for making forest conservation
more durable and effective.

We will continue to implement the various
missions under the National Action Plan
on Climate Change with purpose and
determination.

 

8. The Congress-led government launched
the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar
Mission under which we set the ambitious
target of deploying 20,000 MW of
gtid connected solar power by 2022.
We will ensure this target is met well
in advance.

9. We will also launch a major new “National
Mission on Wind Energy” to harness
the power of this clean and renewable
soutce of energy, which has tremendous
untapped potential in India.

10. India is one of the world’s mega

biodiverse countries. We will continue
to give the highest
pPtiority to protecting
this biodiversity.

11. We will continue
to strongly advance
and protect India’s
interests in  intet-
national climate and
other environmental
negotiations.

16. INNOVATION,
INFORMATION AND
COMMUNICATION
TECHNOLOGY

The Indian National Congress will give a
renewed thrust to use of Information and
Communication Technology (ICT).

Under the Indian National Congress’s
leadership, the country is moving towards
transformation through “‘Democratisation of
Information’. Efforts are underway to use
ICT tools to herald transparency, efficiency,

 

accountability and accessibility to create more
inclusive and responsive structures, which
are in tune with the needs of 21st century
India. In fields such as agriculture, financial
services, commerce, education and health,
this ICT-led Democratisation of Information
is revolutionising service delivery, citizen
interface and accountability through
innovative practices. New tools under this
will be the biggest game changer for bringing
about larger systems reform.

1. The Indian National Congress will ensure
that all Indian residents have a unique
Aaadhar number. This will serve as a
proof of identity and proof of residence.
It will also enable access to services (like
opening a bank
account) for a
vast majority
of Indians.

2. The Indian
National
Congress is
committed
to using the
Aapka  Paisa
Aapka Haath platform for all government
programmes. Direct Benefit Transfer will
ensute time-bound delivery of benefits
at the individual’s doorstep, and remove
corruption and leakages.

3. The Indian National Congress will
increase the annual expenditure on
science and technology to at least 2 %
of GDP. This has to come from both
government and industry. Steps will be
taken to encourage the corporate sector
to invest in Research and Development.

4. The Indian National Congress will
connect all 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats
with high-speed broadband connectivity
within 18 months, with a view of

improving public delivery mechanism.
The vision is to transform governance
and service delivery in areas such as
health, education and agriculture, and
unleash local innovation capacity.

We will ensure the passage of the
Electronic Delivery of Service Bill 2011.
We will, in accordance with the Bill, work
to effectively deliver all public services
(like passports, ration cards and driving
licenses) electronically.

We will work to establish a Rapidly
Deployable  Multi-Protocol Wireless
Communication system; interoperable

17. FIGHTING CORRUPTION

The Indian National Congress re-emphasizes
it’s commitment to better delivery of services
while eliminating corruption and leakages.

The Indian National Congress gave the
people of India the Right To Information
(RTI). The RTI has been our most powerful
weapon in the fight against corruption. Few
governments have had the courage to enact
legislation that rendered their processes
more transparent and open to scrutiny. In
recognition of a widespread public concern
over the issue of corruption we passed the
Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.

THE DETAILED ACTION PLAN

2014 -2019

across all the services engaged in disaster
management.

We will ensure effective implementation
of the India Inclusive Innovation Fund
so that innovative enterprises can
profitably, scalably, and competitively
engage citizens at the bottom of the
economic pyramid. We recognize the
need for grassroots innovation and will
ensure this initiative is well funded.

We currently import popular branded
hardware in the IT sector. We will give
special tax incentives for setting up
manufacturing for such products in
India.

With the passage of the Right to Information
Act, 2005 the Indian National Congress
empowered the people with the biggest tool
to fight corruption and ensure transparency
of public service delivery systems. The recent
landmatk Whistleblowers Protection Act,
2014 is another step in our efforts to create
a society free of corruption. The Indian
National Congress will give the highest priority
to the passage of the following Bills:

1. The Right of Citizens for Time Bound
Delivery of Goods and Services and
Redtessal of their Grievances Bill, 2011
has the potential to be the second RTI.
We will ensure its passage. Redressal
of public grievances at the grassroots

 

level within a specified period of time is
necessary to ensure good governance.

2. Prevention of Bribery of Foreign
Public Officials and Officials of Public
International Organizations Bill 2011
to criminalise bribes offered by foreign
officials and organisations.

3. The Prevention of Corruption
(Amendment) Bill, which enlarges the
definition of taking a bribe and covering
commercial organizations.

4. The Public Procurement Bill, 2012

regulates public procurement by all
Ministries and
Departments of the
Central government,
Central Public Sector
Enterprises and
bodies controlled
by the Central

government to
ensure transparency,
and fair and

equitable treatment of bidders. This
will promote competition and enhance
efficiency in procurement processes.

18. GOVERNANCE REFORMS

The Indian National Congress will give the
highest priority to ensuring accessibility and
transparency in governance systems.

The Indian National Congress will ensure
that the recommendations of the second
Administrative Reforms Commission are
implemented in letter and spirit and monitored
at every step.

 

Electoral Reforms

We will ensure appropriate electoral reforms
to make the political process mote transparent
and accountable.

The Indian National Congress has always
demonstrated its steadfast commitment to
electoral reforms. This includes strengthening
the legal and judicial framework for
disqualifying those convicted of specified
crimes, disqualifying persons convicted of
crimes against women and weaker sections
and disqualifying those who subvert the
integrity of the electoral process.

1. The Indian National Congress is fully
in favour
of a_ special
monitoring
system for timely
disposal of all
cases involving
elections, for
introducing
transparency
in financing of
political activities
and in expanding
state funding for elections.

2. The Indian National Congress will
continue its efforts to enact the Women’s
Reservation Bill to ensure one-third
resetvation for women in Parliament and
State legislatures.

Police Reforms

The Indian National Congress will continue
the process of police modernisation. We will
ensure our police forces ate well-trained and
sensitive to the needs of the citizens.

The Indian National Congress believes that
police administration must become more

THE

progressive and sensitive to the needs of
people, particularly the poor and the weaker
sections of society. Many recommendations
have been made from time to time. The
Judiciary has also made suggestions. We will
accord the highest priority to instituting these
reforms.

Legal and Judicial Reforms

We will bring ina new wave of far reaching legal
and judicial reforms aimed at transforming
the current legal system.

The Indian National Congress considers an
independent judicial system as a corner stone
of our Constitutional democracy and the

A sound judicial system is also central to our
economic growth and social transformation.

In the last ten years, UPA-I and UPA-II have
delivered the largest and fastest expansion
of our legal and judicial system ever in our
history. The government has produced a clear
road map for judicial reform and established a
National Mission for Justice System Delivery
and a National Court Management Systems
Committee housed in the Supreme Court and
operating under its auspices. The funding of
the judicial system, including through funds
made available by the Finance Commission,
has witnessed a quantum increase. The number

of appointing judges through a Judicial
Commission. The Bill will be enacted
after consultation and consensus building
over the mechanisms proposed in the
Bill.

4. We will support all initiatives to make
the higher and lower judiciaries truly
representative of the diversity of our
society, especially with respect to gender,
caste, religion and region. This will be
done in consultation with and with the
guidance of the Chief Justice of India and
his/her companion judges and without
derogation from the independence of
the judiciary.

Judicial

Accountability

different social backgrounds.

8. We will continue to promote and
strengthen Gram Nyayalayas across the
country.

19. INTERNAL SECURITY

The Indian National Congress will continue
to deal firmly with internal security threats.

The Indian National Congress has always given
the highest priority to internal security. Over
the last few years, spending has been increased,
intelligence has
been strengthened
and more personnel
have been recruited
in police and
paramilitary forces.
As a result, overall
incidence of crime
has reduced. We
will continue to
pursue our internal security agenda with
determination.

1. The Indian National Congress recognises
the fundamental need to give a sense
of security to every Indian. It vows to
mobilize all the resources of the State
to maintain law and order and provide
maximum possible security to all Indians,
against both external and internal threats.

2. We will ensure that our police forces are
fully equipped with the modern weapons
and technology. Deployment of specialist
battalions and recruitment of additional
personnel will also be pursued.

3. We will continue to address the challenge
of Left Wing Extremism with a firm hand.
We will strengthen the numbers, equipment
and infrastructure for our security forces
posted in these areas, even as we continue to

flows to terroris
outfits, and stopping money laundering,
to address the issue of terrorism.

 

4. India has emerged as a critical bridge
between the developed world and the
developing world, along with Brazil,
China and South Africa. At the same time
we have our own unique position that

dismantling of the infrastructure of
terrorism on Pakistani soil.

On Sri Lanka, we will engage with
that country to ensure that the Tamil-
speaking people and other minorities
have full equality and equal rights under
the law. We will continue to press the
Government of Sri Lanka to implement
the 13th Amendment and _ create
autonomous provinces, especially the
provinces of the North and the East.

 

For the Indian National Congress, a Manifesto is more than a catalogue
of promises and pledges to be forgotten after elections are over.

It is an agenda for governance to be followed diligently and meticulously.

It is an agenda for good governance on which progress must be reported
to the people of the country, regularly, in a transparent manner.

It is in this spirit that the Congress-led UPA government has been releasing
a “Report to the People” every year. This will continue.

The 2014 Lok Sabha elections will offer stark choices.
On the one side is the Indian National Congress with its long track record of

achievements and accomplishments, with its vision and values bequeathed to it
by a most remarkable generation of Indians led by Mahatma Gandhi.

AN APPEAL

On the other side is an ideology of hate, bigotry and prejudice, an ideology that
negates the very idea of India that has been cherished by us for centuries.

On the one side is the Indian National Congress, which celebrates and rejoices
in the multitude of diversities of India.

On the other side is an ideology that seeks to impose uniformity
in the name of unity.

A vote for the Indian National Congress is a vote for fulfilling the aspirations
of the youth of our nation, for ensuring that women lead a life of dignity.

Economic growth, social harmony, empowerment of weaker sections and
strengthening of democratic institutions have to all go hand-in-hand.

It is only the Indian National Congress that will, by its very character,
ensure that this happens.

Elections 2019 present a stark choice to the people
of India.

Will India be a free and democratic country and will
the Indian people be free from fear, free to live and
work and pray and eat and love and marry according
to their wishes, free from poverty and free to pursue
their ambitions? Or will India be governed by a perni-
cious ideology that will trample upon people’s rights,
institutions, conventions and the healthy differences
that are the essence of a multi-cultural country?

Will India be able to lift all our people with the tide
of growth and will it get rid of poverty or will India
become a country marked by gross inequalities of
income, wealth and power?

The last 5 years have been disastrous for the people
of India. Youth have lost jobs. Farmers have lost
hope. Traders have lost business. Micro, small and
medium enterprises have lost their confidence.
Women have lost a sense of security. Deprived
communities have lost their traditional rights.
Institutions have lost independence.

The harshest blow is that our citizens have lost
their faith in the words of the Prime Minister and
his Government. He has given us only grandiose
promises, empty slogans, failed programmes, false
statistics and an overall climate of fear, intimidation
and hatred.

In this time of deep crisis, the Indian National
Congress promises a clean break from the past

5 years. With this manifesto, the Congress offers to
you the only national alternative: a distinct alterna-
tive that is unwavering in its commitment to truth,
freedom, dignity, self-respect and prosperity for our
people. We promise to make India strong and united,
and a just and prosperous society.

Our manifesto process reflects our commitment to
a higher vision, that of listening to the Jan Awaaz.
It is not the ‘mann ki baat’ of one individual but
the collective voice of lakhs of people.

We have used all possible tools—website, WhatsApp,
email, online petitions, and meetings with citizens,
experts, stakeholders and grassroots activists.
Between October 2018 and February 2019, many

of you engaged in a conversation with the Congress,
in at least 16 languages, through the medium most
easily available to you. Our Manifesto Committee
organised 121 consultations with the public and

53 consultations with experts such as farmers, entre-
preneurs, economists, students, teachers, women’s
groups, doctors, lawyers and many others. We held
consultations in over 60 locations across 24 States
and 3 Union Territories. We also met with NRI repre-
sentatives from over 12 countries.

| have personally been listening to our people’s
voices from all corners of our country. Every single
word in the Congress manifesto reflects your
voices and the aspirations of crores of Indians.

It is an action plan for the future of India. You
inspired this manifesto. It is a living manifesto.
Now, it needs your support and your vote.

We will present a report to the people of India, every
year, on the status of implementation of our mani-
festo. We will also set up an independent social audit
group, which will make its own assessment of how
and to what extent we have fulfilled our promises.

This is our commitment.
Congress promises.
Congress delivers.

Rahul Gandhi
President, Indian National Congress

Foreword by Rahul Gandhi / 5

The 2019 general elections will be held during
Mahatma Gandhi's 150"" birth anniversary year. This
reminds us that these elections are mainly between
2 ideologies. On the one hand is the Indian National
Congress which has worked tirelessly to “wipe every
tear from every eye,” while building a strong, har-
monious, prosperous and modern India. On the other
hand is the ideology of the RSS and its affiliates,
which is working to destroy the very idea of India
that the Mahatma gave his life for.

Over the last 5 years of the BJP government, India
has suffered under the ‘Modi model,’ which has
devastated our economy, impoverished our farmers,
destroyed jobs, divided communities, stoked hatred
and spread fear. It is a model that has stripped the
average Indian of dignity, voice and trust. This is not
the model India deserves. This is a model that all
Indians must reject.

The Congress model is in stark contrast to the BJP
model. The Congress has always provided transfor-
mative development, inclusive growth, responsive

 

governance and reforms that strengthen the
foundations of our Republic.

The 2019 elections are crucial for India’s future and
our children’s future. The choices before our citizens
are crystal clear.

Do we choose freedom or fear?

Do we choose harmony or hatred?

Do we choose inclusion or exclusion?

Do we choose dignity or oppression?

Do we choose prosperity for all or wealth for a few?
Do we choose results or jumlas?

Do we choose justice or injustice?

Our allies and other progressive political parties
across the country recognise the importance of
this moment. We have, therefore, come together
to defeat the BJP-led coalition and set our nation
on the right course. In this Manifesto, we present
to you the only national alternative—the Indian
National Congress.

 

Why Congress Again?

Our record speaks for itself. We have delivered
prosperity for the people of India before. We will
do it again!

Ahead of us lies an electoral battle that will decide
the fate of our nation for decades to come. India has
faced many such grave challenges before. The Indian
National Congress has been at the forefront of many
such battles, and India has always triumphed.

Congress led and won India’s struggle for freedom.
We established and nurtured parliamentary democra-
cy. We led India to adopt a visionary Constitution that
ushered in peaceful socio-economic transformation,
established institutions that safeguarded our Repub-
lic, and provided the nation its moral compass that
has stood the test of time. On the other hand, under
the BJP government, every independent institution
has suffered an unprecedented loss of credibility.
Congress will restore India’s faith in our institutions
and Constitution. We have done it before. We will

do it again!

Congress built a modern India marked by prosper-
ity and productivity. We built the IITs, IIMs, AIIMSs,
CSIR institutions and laboratories, and educational
and scientific research institutions that harnessed
the brilliance of Indian minds and talent. Congress
ushered in the Green Revolution and the White Rev-
olution that transformed lives in rural India. We built
the public sector that was the foundation upon which
industrialisation and technological progress reached
commanding heights. We made India a nuclear and
space power. We led the Electronics and Telecom
Revolutions and made India a global leader in Infor-
mation Technology.

On the other hand, the BJP government has ensured
that farm prices are at a 10-year low, credit growth
is at a 20-year low and unemployment is at a

45-year high. Exports and investment are at histor-
ical lows, projects are stalling at an increasing rate,
and factory closures have led to a stagnating manu-
facturing sector. Digital India, Startup India and Make
in India have been colossal failures. Petrol, diesel
and gas prices have sky-rocketed. Consumers are in
despair and have lost confidence in the government.
Farmers are under extreme stress and have lost
hope. An aspirational India has become a desperate
India. Congress will once again bring India on track
to be among the leading economies of the world in
the 21% Century. We have delivered before. We will
do it again!

Congress launched liberalisation and economic
reforms. It is the Congress that created India’s
successful middle class and the new entrepreneurial
class. It is the Congress that passed rights-based
legislation and created a social safety net for the
very poor. It is the Congress-led UPA government
that lifted an unprecedented 14 crore Indians out
of poverty between 2004 and 2014.

On the other hand, Mr. Modi, arbitrarily and single-
handedly, devastated India’s economy through
demonetisation. It cost the people of India at least
Rs. 4 lakh crores in lost output, lakhs of jobs and
greater indebtedness. Then, a poorly designed GST
was implemented in a hasty and careless manner,
with rules being changed haphazardly almost every
day. Arbitrary powers given to authorities brought
back the ‘Inspector Raj.’ Tax terrorism has crushed
the animal spirits of our entrepreneurs. Together,
these moves have destroyed the lives and livelihoods
of farmers, traders, small business owners and work-
ers in the unorganised sector. Congress will ensure
that the excesses and mistakes of the past 5 years
are reversed. We will usher in an economy that works
for all and we will ensure that no one is left behind.
We have delivered before. We will do it again! -+++s+ssserers

 

Do we choose inclusion or exclusion?
Do we choose prosperity for all

or wealth for a few?
Do we choose results or jumlas?
Do we choose justice or injustice?

 

The Choice Before You / 7

seeeeeeeeeeeeee Inspired by the slogan ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan,’ the Congress
government led India to victory in the 1965 war with Pakistan.
In 1971, we decisively defeated Pakistan and liberated
Bangladesh. We crushed secessionist forces, healed differ-
ences, and ensured the unity and integration of our people.
Congress leaders Mahatma Gandhi, Smt. Indira Gandhi, Shri
Rajiv Gandhi and Shri Beant Singh made the ultimate sacrifice
for India.

On the other hand, the BJP Government’s policies have been
based on the whim of one man, sidelining the Ministry of Ex-
ternal Affairs and the entire diplomatic corps. The BJP Govern-
ment is solely responsible for cancelling the gains made under
the UPA years, the widening of fault lines, the total alienation
of the people of Jammu & Kashmir, and a worsening of the
security situation in that State. Pseudo-nationalism is on the
rise and the success of the armed forces is politicised. The
BJP Government's political boasts have come even as the
defence budget, as a percentage of GDP. has been reduced

to its lowest levels in 50 years. The Congress will once again
restore the pride of our armed forces, insulate them from
politics, entrust the conduct of foreign policy to professional
diplomats and strengthen India’s hard power.

We have delivered before. We will do it again!

Jobs

Unemployment is the gravest challenge to the country and job creation is the highest priority
for the economy. In the last 5 years, there has been a dramatic rise in unemployment. Today,
unemployment is touching a 45-year high of 6.1 per cent according to the government’s own
figures. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy puts the number at 7.2 per cent. At the
end of this February, 3.1 crore people were actively looking for jobs. Data indicates that total
employment has declined, the labour participation rate has declined and existing jobs have
been destroyed. Every section of society has been affected by growing unemployment and the
destruction of existing jobs: youth, families, women, small business persons, traders, farmers,

daily-wage workers and agricultural labourers.

Congress pledges to give the highest priority

to protecting existing jobs and creating new jobs.
In order to underline the link between the growth
of the industry and services sectors and rapid cre-
ation of jobs, Congress will create a new Ministry
of Industry, Services and Employment.

All of the 4 lakh vacancies as on 1 April 2019

in the Central Government, Central Public Sector
Enterprises, Judiciary and Parliament will be filled
before the end of March 2020. As a condition for
devolution of funds to the healthcare and educa-
tion sectors and to Panchayats and Municipalities,
Congress will request State Governments to fill all
vacancies, estimated at 20 lakh, in the 2 sectors
and in local bodies.

We will work with State Governments to create
new Seva Mitra positions (estimated at 10 lakh)
in every Gram Panchayat and every Urban Local
Body to ensure the effective delivery of govern-
ment services to citizens.

Application fees for government examinations
and government posts will be abolished.
Congress pledges to create lakhs of new jobs for
qualified teachers, doctors, nurses, paramedics,
technicians, instructors and administrators through
a massive expansion of the education and
health sectors.

Para-state workers such as Anganwadi workers,
ASHA workers, rozgarsahayaks, preraks, and anude-
shaks, form the backbone of the public service
delivery system. We will increase funding for the
relevant programmes and work with State Govern-
ments to ensure that all arrears are paid imme-
diately. We will also work with State Governments
and attempt to address all pending contentious
issues regarding their salaries and work conditions.
In addition, we will expand the ASHA programme
and appoint a second ASHA worker in all villages
with a population exceeding 2500 persons.

We will trigger rapid growth of the manufac-
turing sector, particularly of MSMEs, through the
provision of world-class infrastructure in industrial
hubs and cluster towns in order to aid the expan-
sion of current units and the creation of new units.

MSMEs account for 90 per cent of all employment
outside agriculture. The definition of MSMEs based
on capital employed is biased against labour.
Congress will link the definition of MSME to
employment. A business employing 10 persons
or less will be ‘micro;’ between 11 and 100 will
be ‘small;’ and between 101 and 500 will be
‘medium.’

We will create an Enterprise Support Agency

to help entrepreneurs, including start-ups, with
all-round business support including counselling,
incubation, access to technology, funding, domestic
and export markets, and the creation of new prod-
ucts, services and intellectual property.

We promise regulatory forbearance for Micro
and Small Enterprises. They will be exempt from
all applicable laws and regulations (except the
Minimum Wages Act and tax laws) for a period

of 3 years from 1 April 2019 or, in the case of
new businesses, the date of commencement of
business. This means freedom from ‘Inspector Raj’
until they stabilise.

Congress will promote ‘Mass Entrepreneurship’
and support entrepreneurs to replicate tried and
tested models of businesses in order to meet the
growing demand for such goods and services.

The main job-creating sectors are construction,
textiles, leather, gems & jewellery, entertainment,
tourism and retail businesses. We will reward
businesses that create new jobs by lowering
the effective direct tax rates and by lowering
contributions to the CSR fund.

We will provide fiscal incentives to businesses
that employ a certain percentage of women.
Exports create jobs. We will reward export-
oriented industries through tax rebates

and incentives.

Tourism creates jobs. Congress promises an ade-
quately capitalised Tourism Development Bank
to provide low-cost, long-term funds for invest-
ment in tourism-related businesses. We will also
offer lower rates of corporate and personal
income tax on tourism-related business income.

We recognise the need to create lakhs of low-
skilled jobs in order to absorb young men and
women who have completed only a few years in
school. Congress will launch 2 major programmes
to be implemented through Gram Sabhas and
urban local bodies that will create 1 crore jobs:
a. Repair and restoration of water bodies
(‘Water Bodies Restoration Mission’); and
b. Regeneration and afforestation of wasteland
and degraded land (‘Wasteland Regeneration
Mission’).
Congress will require businesses employing
100 persons or more to start an apprenticeship

19.

programme, impart skills, pay a stipend, and
employ from among the trained apprentices
whenever a job is created or becomes vacant

in that business. We will amend The Companies
(Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules,
2014 to include ‘Apprenticeship’ as an additional
activity.

We will identify new kinds of jobs that will emerge
with the advent of new technologies and will offer
opportunities to youth to acquire the skill-sets
necessary for these jobs.

 

Industry

Congress initiated liberalisation in 1991 with a new Industrial Policy. Taking note of the
changes in the global economy and the Indian economy, Congress promises another radical,

forward-looking Industrial Policy.

The BJP Government mouths empty slogans. Its record is dismal in terms of the growth rate
of Industry sector GVA and gross capital formation in the Industry sector. Congress promises

to reverse these disappointing trends.

Congress promises to increase the share of
India’s manufacturing sector from the current
level of 16 per cent of GDP to 25 per cent within
a period of 5 years and to make India a manufac-
turing hub for the world. Congress believes that
anything that can be made in another country can
be made in India. Congress promises that it will
adopt policies, formulate rules, levy taxes and
reward entrepreneurship that will make India a
renowned centre of manufacturing.

Congress will work with State Governments to set
up New Industrial Towns with the required infra-
structure and turn them into manufacturing hubs
for a variety of industrial products.

We will announce policies that will help India
retain its leading position in the manufacture
of engineering goods, petroleum products, gems
& jewellery, drugs & pharmaceuticals, garments

& textiles and chemicals.

We will announce policies that will help India gain
a leadership position in steel, metals, cement,
machinery, electronic goods, computer hardware,
automobiles etc.

Congress will announce a ‘Make for the World’
policy under which foreign and Indian companies
will be invited to invest in ‘Exclusive Export-only
Zones’, manufacture and export their entire pro-
duction, pay no indirect taxes and pay a low rate
of corporate tax.

06.

07.

08.

09.

10.

As the UPA did from 2004 to 2014, we will make
a determined effort to revive stalled projects
and bring locked-up capital to use and generate
employment.

We will promote the manufacture and export of
India’s traditional products like handloom prod-
ucts and handicrafts that employ lakhs of persons.
Congress will acquire patents, create a patent pool
and make advanced technologies available to small
and medium businesses.

Controls have crept into the system in the name
of regulations. Congress promises to do a quick
review of the rules and regulations made by
the BJP Government in the last 5 years and repeal
as many of them as are necessary to free industry
and business from the ‘Control Raj.’

In the last 5 years, tax authorities have been
given extraordinary discretionary powers that have
throttled industry and come to be described as
‘tax terrorism.’ Investigative agencies have mis-
interpreted the laws and have instilled fear among
businesspersons. Congress will review these
discretionary powers and arbitrary actions and
take steps to allow industry and business to
function with a large degree of freedom.

Infrastructure
A basic weakness of the Indian economy has been infrastructure. Flawed design, inefficient
execution, insufficient capacity and poor maintenance of infrastructure have dragged India’s

growth rate down.

Congress promises to address these deficiencies with a combination of planning, technology,
quality and accountability.

All available models and instrumentalities will be used to build infrastructure—public sector,
private sector and public-private partnership.

Roads, railway and electricity are among vital infrastructure. They are also crucial public goods.

Congress promises to augment the total length
of national highways and increase the pace of

investment, enhanced production, transparency,
efficiency, risk-reward concerns, environmental sus-
construction. The focus will be on improved design tainability, inter-generational equity, accountability,
and quality, maintenance and accountability. competition and appropriate sectoral regulation.

Cities, Urbanisation and Urban Policy

India is fast urbanising. Nearly 34 per cent of our population lives in towns and cities and the
number is growing. As in the rest of the world, India’s cities can become engines of growth.

The Smart Cities Mission of the BJP government, which replaced the successful JNNURM,
was a colossal failure and a waste of money with no visible results.

Congress promises to formulate a comprehensive to do urban planning and implement

policy on Urbanisation after wide consultation. municipal works.

We will address the issues concerning towns 04. We will enforce the 74° Amendment to the

Congress promises to formulate and implement a
policy on urban transport with emphasis on met-
ro rail, suburban rail, electric vehicles, public bus
transport, hired vehicles and shared vehicles. We
will encourage non-motorised transport, namely,
walking and cycling.

 

Rural Development

Congress promises to enhance infrastructure in rural areas and improve the quality of
public goods such as roads, bridges, water supply, sanitation, electricity and schools.

01. In order to fill the gaps in sector-specific schemes
as well correct any unintended bias, we will
empower Panchayats and Municipalities
to design and execute infrastructure projects.
Congress promises to establish a non-lapsable
Rural Infrastructure Fund that will provide
loans and grants to specific infrastructure projects
undertaken by Panchayats and Municipalities.

02. We will launch MGNREGA 3.0 to address issues
of water security, soil quality and similar issues
that aggravate farmers’ distress. To this end,
we will:

a. Increase the guaranteed days of employment up
to 150 days in cases where 100 days have been

achieved in a block/district;

b. Use MGNREGA labour in the Waterbodies Resto-

ration Mission and the Wasteland Regeneration
Mission; and

c. Use MGNREGA funds to build public assets such

Congress promises to connect all villages and

habitations with a population of 250 with a road

under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.

Broadband connectivity will be provided to all

village Panchayats by the year 2021.

The allocation to the National Drinking Water

Mission that has suffered neglect under the BJP

government will be increased.

We will pass the Right to Homestead Act to

provide a homestead for every household that

does not own a home or own land on which a

house may be built.

 

Informal and Unorganised Sector

Congress promises a fair deal for the crores of workers and the self-employed who toil

every day in the unorganised and informal sector.

01. We will encourage and support micro and
small enterprises that collectivise unorganised
sector workers including waste pickers and scrap
collectors.

02. Congress will ensure that notified minimum wag-

es are paid to workers in the unorganised sector.

03. Congress will ratify ILO Convention 87 (Freedom

of Association) and [LO Convention 98 (Right to
Organise and Collective Bargaining).

04. The Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and
Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014 will be

05. Congress will guarantee portability for the ration

card possessed by a migrant worker and right to
access ration articles at the place of work.

06.

Congress promises to establish Aajeevika
Kendras (Livelihood Centres) in all major cities
and towns where a migrant worker may register
himself/herself in order to:
a. Access government services;
b. Access basic healthcare;
c. Access créches and schools for his
or her children;
d. Access skill development and training
centres; and
e. Access legal services.

To ensure that no Indian is left behind, Congress will provide a Minimum
Income Support Programme (MISP) or Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY) under
which Rs. 72,000 a year will be transferred to the poorest 20 percent
families in India. We will provide special respite to farmers and farm
workers, not just through “Karz Maafi” or a loan waiver but by setting
farmers on the path to “Karz Mukti,” or Freedom from Indebtedness.

Agriculture, Farmers and Farm Labour

Many years ago, Jawaharlal Nehru said, ‘Everything can wait but not agriculture.’

In the last 5 years, under the BJP Government, the agriculture sector has been driven into

deep crisis. Adequate MSP was denied for 4 years; the procurement machinery was non-existent
or weak; debt of farmers mounted; prices of inputs increased steadily; credit was inadequate;
demonetisation devastated the cash-based agricultural economy; co-operative credit societies
and apex co-operative banks were denied the right to convert their deposits, thereby choking
co-operative credit to the farmer; the terms of trade moved decisively against agriculture; the
crop insurance scheme robbed the farmer and enriched the insurance companies; and with little
or no support from the government farmers and farm labourers were left to fend for themselves.

Congress has heard the cry of anguish of farmers and feels the pain of their acute distress.

Immediately after forming the governments in
Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, as
promised, the 3 Congress Governments waived the
loans of farmers. Congress promises to waive the
outstanding farm loans in other States as well.
We will not stop with just providing “Karz Maafi”
or a loan waiver. Through a combination of remu-
nerative prices, lower input costs, and assured
access to institutional credit, we will set our Kisans
on the path to “Karz Mukti,” or Freedom from
Indebtedness.

Debt is a civil liability and we will not allow
criminal proceedings to be instituted against

a farmer who is unable to pay his/her debt.

In order to ensure priority to the issues affecting
the agriculture sector, we will present a separate
“Kisan Budget.”

Congress promises to establish a permanent
National Commission on Agricultural Devel-
opment and Planning consisting of farmers,
agricultural scientists and agricultural economists
to examine and advise the government on how to
make agriculture viable, competitive and remuner-
ative. The recommendations of the Commission
shall be ordinarily binding on the government. The
Commission will subsume the existing Commission
for Agricultural Costs and Prices and recommend
appropriate minimum support prices.

Congress also promises to establish a Commission
on Marginal Farmers and Agricultural Labour
to advise on policies and programmes that will
help them earn income from higher wages and
from non-crop based agriculture such as horticul-
ture and floriculture, dairying and poultry.

We will completely re-design the BJP government’s
failed Fasal Bima Yojana (Crop Insurance
Scheme) that has only enriched the insurance
companies at the cost of the farmers. We will
direct insurance companies to offer crop insurance
and charge premiums on the principle of ‘no profit,
no loss.’

Congress promises to work with State Governments
to digitise land ownership and land tenancy
records and, in particular, recognise ownership
and tenancy rights of women farmers and
ensure women get the benefits of agriculture-
related schemes.

Congress will promote Farmer Producer Compa-
nies/Organisations to enable farmers to access
inputs, technology and markets.

We will review the prices of agricultural inputs,
extend subsidies where necessary, and establish
facilities to hire farm machinery.

Congress will repeal the Agricultural Produce
Market Committees Act and make trade in
agricultural produce—including exports and
inter-state trade—free from all restrictions.

We will establish farmers’ markets with
adequate infrastructure and support in large
villages and small towns to enable the farmer to
bring his/her produce and freely market the same.
Congress will formulate a policy on export and
import of agricultural products that will support
farmers and Farmer Producer Companies/Organisa-
tions and enhance their income.

Congress promises to formulate a policy to enable
the construction of modern warehouses, cold
storage and food processing facilities in every
block of the country.

. We will revive, strengthen and improve the old

system of ‘Agricultural Extension Services’

and bring the best knowledge and best practices
to every agricultural holding in the country.
Congress will encourage farmers to diversify into
the production of local varieties of millets and
pulses that can be procured for the PDS, Mid-Day
Meals Scheme and the ICDS programme.
Congress promises a major programme to promote
horticulture, pisciculture and sericulture for
diversification and greater income for farmers. We
will launch a national project to double the value
of production in 5 years in dairying and poultry.

Congress will promote organic farming, encour-
age farmers to use mixed fertilizers and pesticides,
support verification of organic products, and help
them secure better prices for organic products.
Congress promises to double the funding in

5 years for teaching, R&D, agriculture-related
pure sciences and applied science and technol-
ogy in the agricultural sector. We will establish a
College of Agriculture and a College of Veterinary
Sciences in every district of the country.

Congress promises that the distortions that have
crept into the text and the implementation of the
Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Reset-
tlement Act, 2013 and the Forest Rights Act,
2006 will be removed and the original purposes
of the Acts restored and enforced.

21. The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 belongs
to the age of controls. Congress promises to
replace the Act by an enabling law that can
be invoked only in the case of emergencies.

22. Building on past experience, Congress will
re-design MGNREGA and provide for:

a. Increasing the guaranteed days of employment
up to 150 days in cases where 100 days have
been achieved in a block/district;

b. Use of labour in the Waterbodies Restoration
and the Wasteland Regeneration Missions;

c. Building village-level assets such as primary
health centres, classrooms, libraries etc.

 

Economic Policy

India is a developing country aspiring to be a middle-income country by the year 2030.
Wealth creation and the welfare of our people are our 2 principal goals.

Congress economic philosophy is based on embracing the idea of an open and liberal market
economy, creation of wealth, sustainable development, reduction of inequalities and assurance
of welfare of all sections of the people. Such growth will be driven by the private sector and a
viable public sector and underpinned by a robust system of social security.

Our economy is still over-regulated. Structural problems remain. Government control and
bureaucratic interference are aplenty. Regulators have morphed into controllers. There is
growing interference by the courts in economic policies. The BJP Government has reversed
the clock of reforms. Congress promises to undo these distortions and restore an open,

liberal market economy.

 

01.

02.

03.

04.

Fiscal stability is the starting point. Congress
promises to reverse the BJP Government's fiddling
with the target of fiscal deficit. Congress promis-
es to achieve the target of 3 per cent of GDP by
2020-21 and remain under that limit. The revenue
deficit will be contained, as far as possible, under
1 per cent of GDP. Off-Budget and extra-Budget
borrowings will be faithfully reported with the jus-
tification for such debt and the means of servicing
and repaying such debt.

Monetary policy is the province of the Reserve

Bank of India. Congress promises to reverse

the unwarranted and illegal interference by the

BJP government into the functioning of the RBI.

Congress will respect the autonomy of the RBI

in matters reserved to the RBI under the Reserve

Bank of India Act, 1939, including the formulation

of monetary policy. However, the Governor shall pe-

riodically render an account to a committee of Par-
liament. Congress promises that the government
will work closely with the RBI to ensure that fiscal
policy and monetary policy are aligned to achieve
the common goal of growth with price stability.

Sustained economic growth is the path toward

creating wealth. Millions of people produce goods

and services and they must have a large degree

of freedom, unfettered by excessive regulations.

Congress will provide a conducive policy climate

that will recognise the contributions of the pri-

vate sector and the public sector, promote entre-
preneurship, encourage innovation, and employ
advanced technology and reward risk-taking.

We are the party that first declared the criticality

of high and sustained economic growth mea-

sured by GDP. Congress reiterates its firm belief in

a high rate of growth of GDP. Hence, the 4 drivers

of economic growth are important and the Con-

gress wishes to state its position on each of these:

a. Private Investment: In an open, market econo-
my, the private sector must play the lead role in
identifying opportunities, mobilising resources,
adopting advanced technology, producing goods
and services, and securing domestic and foreign
markets. Congress promises to extend full
support to the private sector and to revive the
animal spirits of our entrepreneurs.

b. Government Expenditure: Government expen-
diture must play a lead role in the creation and
provision of public goods. Congress promises
adequate expenditure on roads, railways,
waterways, drinking water, sanitation, healthcare,
education, national and internal security.

c. Domestic Consumption: In a developing
country, rise in consumption is a sign of healthy
economic growth. It is important that the poorer
sections of our people consume more. Supply of

05.

10.

goods and services must be abundant and prices
must be reasonably stable. Congress will repose
faith in the trading community and create a
policy environment that will encourage domestic
consumption.

d. Exports: No country has achieved high eco-
nomic growth without high growth of exports.
An example is India during the Congress period
from 2004 to 2014. Congress will adopt a
policy on foreign trade that will ensure that
exports become, once again, a key driver of
economic growth.

Congress promises to encourage saving, especially

household saving, through suitable rewards for

savers. Savings provide the resources for invest-
ment. Our goal will be to achieve a savings level
of 40 per cent of GDP and a Gross Capital For-
mation level of 35 per cent of GDP. We will work
with banks and insurance companies to introduce
simple financial products for households.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plays a crucial

part in development. FDI will be welcomed in all

sectors, subject to exceptions on the ground of
national security. Rules and regulations will be
minimal. FDI will be accorded national treatment
and there will be a level playing field for foreign
and domestic investors. There will be no expropria-
tion and no retrospective taxation.

Investments have to be prudently distributed

among the different sectors—agriculture and

allied activities, industry, and services with special
emphasis on education and healthcare. Congress
believes in the crucial role played by market in
allocation of resources. Where it is absolutely
necessary, there will be policy intervention to
prevent misallocation of resources.

Congress promises to review all laws, rules

and regulations governing investments within

3 months. Instruments that are inconsistent with

a market economy or outdated or obstructionist

will be repealed.

Foreign Trade Policy will be reviewed and restat-

ed within 3 months. Exports and imports shall be

free and consistent with WTO rules. Any instrument
that has the effect of altering this guiding principle
will be supported by sufficient justification and its
operation will be limited to a sunset date.

Every sector of the economy needs credit. A ro-

bust and healthy banking system, supplemented

by non-banking finance companies, is critical to
delivery of credit. While the RBI is the regulator of
banks and NBFCs, the government has the respon-
sibility to ensure that there is adequate liquidity,
cash in circulation and flow of credit. The BJP

Government denied adequate credit to MSMEs,

agriculture, trade and exports. They created the

Minimum Income Support Programme or
Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY)

The abolition of poverty remains the foremost goal of the Congress. We recall with pride that
the Congress-led UPA government lifted 14 crore people out of poverty between 2004 and
2014.

It is true that rapid and broad-based growth will reduce poverty and, in the medium to long

term, eliminate poverty. On the other hand, decisive and focused intervention has the capac-
ity to eliminate poverty within a decade. Congress, therefore, sets the goal of elimination of

abject poverty by the year 2030.

 

01.

01.

Congress believes that the size of India’s GDP and
the level of Total Expenditure (Central and State
Governments) allow us to undertake an ambitious
programme of cash transfer to the poorest sec-
tions of the people without in anyway affecting the
goal of fiscal prudence. The main features of the
Minimum Income Support Programme (MISP)
or Nyuntam Aay Yojana (NYAY) will be:

a. The target population will be 5 crore families
who constitute the poorest 20 per cent of all
families. They will be the beneficiaries of MISP
or NYAY;

. Each family will be guaranteed a cash transfer of
Rs. 72,000 a year;

As far as possible, the money will be transferred
to the account of a woman of the family who
has a bank account or who will be urged to open
a bank account;

. There will a Design phase (3 months) followed
by a Pilot and Testing phase (6-9 months)
before roll-out;

a

a

 

e. The rollout will be implemented in phases;

f. The estimated cost will be <1 per cent of GDP
in Year 1 and <2 per cent of GDP in Year 2 and
thereafter.

g. As the nominal GDP grows and families move
out of poverty, the cost will decline as a propor-
tion of GDP.

02. Congress will appoint an independent panel

of eminent economists, social scientists and
statisticians to oversee the design, testing, roll-
out and implementation of the programme. The
programme will move from one stage to the other
only after a ‘go ahead’ from the panel. Congress
intends to implement NYAY as a joint scheme

of the Central and State Governments. The
scheme will be funded through new revenues and
rationalisation of expenditure. Current merit sub-
sidy schemes that are intended to achieve specific
objectives will be continued.

03. The Congress goal is that ‘No Indian Family Shall

Be Left Behind.’

To eliminate abject poverty by
2030, Congress will introduce

Nyuntam Aay Yojana to provide
Rs. 72,000 a year to the poorest
20 per cent families in India.

 

 

Taxation and Tax Reforms

The 2 major taxes that will be the backbone of the economy are Income Tax and Goods and
Services Tax. Congress reiterates its firm belief that the principles underlying these taxes
should be simplicity, transparency and progressivity. Besides, a good tax administration
must place trust in, and enjoy the trust of, taxpayers. Congress will put an end to the tax
terrorism unleashed by the BJP government that has put uncertainty and fear in the minds

of individuals and businesses.

Direct Taxes Code

Congress promises to enact the Direct Taxes Code
in the first year of our government. It will usher in
an era of simplicity, transparency, tax equity, easy
compliance and impartial administration.

02. Congress promises that the Direct Taxes Code
will levy taxes at reasonable and progres-
sive rates having regard to the level of current
incomes, income inequalities and the principles
of tax equity.

Goods & Services Tax 2.0

. Congress promises to review and replace the
current GST laws with the GST 2.0 regime that
will truly reflect the intent and purpose of a
non-cascading, value-added, indirect tax.

. The GST 2.0 regime will be based on a single,
moderate, standard rate of tax on all goods
and services. The rate will be revenue neutral to
the current indirect tax revenues of the Central
and State Governments and will take note of the
potential of GST 2.0 to boost their tax revenues.

. The GST 2.0 regime will levy a special rate of
duty on demerit goods.

. GST 2.0 will be easy to administer, easy to
understand by the taxpayer, and easy to comply
with. We are confident that GST 2.0 will promote
growth, new businesses and employment. The
website under GST 2.0 will be re-designed and
made user-friendly with inputs from the taxpayers.

. Congress promises that Real Estate (all sectors),
Petroleum Products, Tobacco and Liquor will be
brought within the ambit of GST 2.0 in a manner
and time period not exceeding 2 years agreed to
in the GST Council.

. Essential goods of mass consumption (such as
food grains, lifesaving drugs, vaccines, etc.) and
essential services will be exempted from GST 2.0
or zero-rated.

. All goods and services that are exported will
be zero-rated and not subject to GST 2.0.

Congress promises that threshold exemption for
small businesses will not be affected by inter-state
supply of goods or services.

In order to support small, unregistered business-
es that supply goods and services, there will be
no GST liability on the purchaser through the
reverse charge mechanism.

Congress promises to abolish the e-way bill. Tax
evasion will be detected through the risk manage-
ment mechanism and strengthening the intelli-
gence machinery.

Congress will endeavor to allocate a share of GST
revenues to Panchayats and Municipalities.
Congress promises that a taxpayer will be required
to file a simple, single quarterly return for his/
her business and an annual return. Every tax payer
will be subject to assessment by a single authority
based upon turnover.

The GST Council will be the policy-making body
and will be served by a permanent secretariat of
tax economists, tax policy experts and tax pro-
fessionals. Its minutes will be put in the public
domain.

Congress promises that the DTC and GST 2.0

will be essentially civil laws and any violations
will attract civil penalties that will be proportionate
to the tax evaded. Prosecution under DTC and GST
2.0 will be only in cases of criminal conspiracy or
corruption or fraud.

Banking and Financial Sector

Congress affirms its belief in a competitive banking and financial sector.

The BJP government has considerably weakened the banking sector in the last 5 years; there has
been a sharp rise in non-performing assets; crony capitalism has thrived; and deserving sectors
and individuals have been denied credit. Congress promises to reverse these developments.

Congress promises a comprehensive review of
the concept, role and functions of Public Sector
Banks (PSBs) in order to make PSBs robust and
competitive with healthy balance sheets.
Congress will amalgamate 2 or more PSBs so
that there will be only 6-8 PSBs with a national
presence and reach. Each of the amalgamated
PSBs will be adequately capitalised.

. We will undertake a comprehensive review of the

governance structure of PSBs and implement
changes to make the PSB an independent com-
mercial banking organisation that is competitive,
healthy, efficient and profitable. We will abolish
the redundant Banking Board Bureau.

Congress promises that PSBs will continue to im-
plement policies to serve the larger public interest
including lending to priority and other disad-

vantaged sectors that are denied adequate credit.

We are concerned by the recent failure of some
NBFCs that has affected the bond market, mutual
funds and the flow of credit. Congress promises

to review and strengthen the regulatory regime

of NBFCs in order to prevent such failures and to
restore investor confidence.

We will take the necessary policy and administra-
tive measures to develop a robust, deep and liquid
corporate bond market, municipal bond market
and infrastructure investment trusts.

Congress promises to promote new Development
Banks in order to provide long-term credit to
development and infrastructure projects.
Indian-owned new technology companies face a

up to global size and standards. Congress will
set up an India Global Companies Fund and
create a policy environment to support Indian-
owned companies to become global companies.
Congress will encourage the establishment

of State-level and Regional-level institutions,
including small banks, to provide bank credit
to MSMEs. Congress will also encourage State
Governments to revive State Financial Corporations
to provide long-term credit and risk capital to
MSMEs.

. We will strengthen and technologically-enable

Regional Rural Banks and Banking Correspon-
dents to accelerate financial inclusion so that
citizens are provided banking services in their
neighbourhood.

Congress will work with the RBI to simplify the
KYC process, avoid repetitive verification, and
use a wider range of documents for the purpose.
Congress promises to take necessary measures to
develop a deep and broad securities market that
will offer products that will attract more investors
to the securities market, give them safe and ade-
quate returns and offer investment solutions

to their long term needs.

We will adopt policies to attract more
investment—Indian and foreign—in our
financial markets.

We promise to take hard measures to prevent
fraud in the banking, securities and financial
markets (including money collection schemes)
and deliver swift and deterrent punishment

to offenders.

Congress will encourage the
establishment of State-level

and Regional-level institutions,
including small banks, to provide
bank credit to MSMEs.

National Security

National security is dependent on a sound defence policy, a sound foreign policy and wise
leadership. National security is not enhanced by chest-thumping or exaggerated claims.

Congress will reverse the trend of declining de-
fence spending under the NDA government, and
will ensure that defence spending is increased

to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces.
We will expedite all modernisation programmes
of the armed forces in a transparent manner.
Congress promises to take strategic and hard
measures to defend the territorial integrity

of India and ensure the safety of our people.

The concept of national security in the 21% century
has expanded beyond defence of the territory to
include data security, cyber security, financial
security, communication security and security of
trade routes. Congress promises to evolve suitable
policies to address each of these subjects.
Congress will establish the office of Chief of De-
fence Staff (CDS) to be the principal adviser to
the Government on matters relating to defence.
Congress will provide a statutory basis to the
National Security Council (NSC) and the

06.

07.

office of National Security Adviser (NSA). Their
powers and functions will be defined under the law
and both authorities, and the agencies under them,
will be accountable to Parliament.

The BJP government left the National Security
Advisory Board in limbo between January 2015
and October 2016 and then truncated the body.
Congress will re-establish the NSAB, provide a
statutory basis to the body, appoint experts from
different disciplines and ensure that it will function
as a permanent, professional advisory body advis-
ing the NSC and the government.

Congress promises to rapidly expand domestic
capacity to manufacture defence and security
equipment. We will create manufacturing capac-
ities in the public sector and in pre-qualified,
security-cleared private sector companies.

 

Internal Security

Congress promises that it will keep a vigilant eye on the security situation and take every
measure that is required to maintain law and order and to provide a sense of security for every

citizen and for every visitor to India.

. The key to internal security is intelligence, analy-

sis and quick response. Congress had put in place

the Multi-Agency Centre and the NSG regional

hubs. Congress had also proposed to establish
the National Counter-Terrorism Centre and

NATGRID. The BJP government dismantled the

preparatory work and wasted 5 years. NCTC was

put in the cold storage and NATGRID is yet to be
made operational. Congress promises that NCTC
will be set up within 3 months and NATGRID will

be made operational by December 2019.

The most serious threats to internal security

emanate from (1) terrorism, (2) infiltration

of militants, (3) Maoism or Naxalism and (4)

caste or communal violence. Congress believes

that each of these threats deserves a separate and
distinct response.

a. We promise an uncompromising approach and
hard measures to put an end to terrorism and
to the infiltration of militants.

b. In the case of Maoism, the Congress will reso-
lutely fight violent activities. At the same time,
Congress will address developmental challenges
in the areas concerned, enlist the support

03.

of the people and win over the Maoist cadres.
c. In the case of caste or communal violence,
Congress will put down such violence with a
firm hand using the police forces at its com-
mand, apprehend the instigators and bring
them to justice. There will be no room for
self-appointed vigilante groups and moral
policing brigades.
Congress will work with State Governments to
increase the strength of State police forces,
fill all vacancies, equip and train them, and deploy
them impartially to maintain law and order and
to detect and punish violators and instigators.
Congress promises to take strong action with
respect to crimes against women, Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled Tribes and minorities. The
law will be applied on the perpetrators without fear
or favour. They will not be allowed to walk on the
streets with a sense of impunity.
Congress will hold the District Administration
responsible for riots, caste or communal violence,
large scale crimes against women, and for the
widespread breakdown of law and order.

India’s foreign policy was profoundly influenced by the freedom movement and was devel-
oped through the collective wisdom of far-sighted leaders. Unfortunately, foreign policy under
the BJP has been reduced to the whim of one man, has become transactional and has been
marked by outrageous flip-flops. Our national interest has been the casualty. We promise to
reverse these damaging developments and repose faith in our diplomatic corps to advise on,

formulate and conduct foreign policy.

Congress affirms its firm belief in the continued
relevance of the policy of friendship, peaceful
co-existence, non-alignment, independence

of thought and action, and increased bilateral
engagement in its relations with other countries

of the world.

Congress promises to establish a National Council
on Foreign Policy consisting of members of the
Cabinet Committee on Security, scholars, domain
experts and diplomats to advise the Government
on matters concerning foreign policy.

We will work closely with all countries of the world,
and particularly India’s neighbours and the G-20
countries, in various multi-lateral forums and
institutions.

Foreign Trade will be an important element of our
foreign policy and we promise to make every effort
to significantly increase trade with other countries.
It was a Congress government that opened

India’s economy to other countries of the world.
Congress promises to strengthen its relations

with other countries through enhanced economic
co-operation, two-way investments and closer
relations between businesspersons.

Congress is implacably opposed to terrorism any-
where in the world and promises to work with oth-
er countries to eliminate terrorist groups, terrorist
acts and cross-border terrorism. We will persuade
the United Nations to constantly review the list of
terrorists and to expand the scope of sanctions.

end its support to the terrorist groups that it
shelters.

Congress promises to pass a Law on Asylum con-
sistent with international treaties and conventions.
We will re-double the efforts to win for permanent
membership India in the UN Security Council and
the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

Congress will work with SAARC and ASEAN coun-
tries to enhance the volume of trade, investments,
tourism and cultural exchanges and reap the bene-
fits of geographical proximity.

Congress promises to establish effective mecha-
nisms with neighbouring countries, especially Sri
Lanka and Pakistan, to resolve the problems faced
by fishermen, to eliminate conflict, coercive action
and loss of lives, and to improve livelihood oppor-
tunities for our fishing communities.

We will strengthen the Indian Council of
Cultural Relations, expand its engagement with
other countries and encourage the Council to in-
crease the projection of India’s soft power globally.
Congress promises to increase significantly the size
of the Foreign Service, induct domain experts and
scholars, open more missions abroad, participate
more effectively in international organisations,
leverage our growing economy and acquire a
position of leadership in the world.

Congress is implacably opposed
to terrorism anywhere in the
world and promises to eliminate

terrorist groups, terrorist acts
and cross-border terrorism.

Border Security

India’s borders must be secure. Secure borders protect the sovereignty and integrity of India.

Congress promises to enhance border security by undertaking a number of measures.

We will increase the strength of border guarding
forces—BSF, SSB, ITBP and Assam Rifles—and
post them on or close to the border to prevent
infiltration, illegal immigration and smuggling.

We will construct modern, well-equipped Inte-
grated Border Outposts to provide good working
and living conditions for the forces. The distance
between 2 border outposts will be reduced. The
period of posting in high altitude border outposts
will be reduced to 3 months at a time.

03.

We will accelerate the construction of border
roads along all borders of India, especially, the
India-China border. We will enhance the capacity of
the Border Roads Organisation and create separate
divisions to build roads along the India-China and
the India-Myanmar borders.

 

Ex-Servicemen

. Under the UPA Governments, Congress accepted

the principle of One Rank One Pension (OROP)
and took 3 steps in 2006, 2010 and 2013 to-
wards implementing the same. In February 2014,
the UPA Government decided to close the gap for
all retirees in all ranks. Ex-servicemen believe that
the BJP Government has not implemented OROP to
their satisfaction. Congress promises to remove the
anomalies in the implementation of OROP.
Congress promises to formulate and implement

a policy of compensation to the families of
martyrs that will include full pay and allowances,
funding children’s education, a government job

for a member of the martyr’s family and suitable
monetary compensation.

Congress will formulate and implement a policy
that will allow Armed Forces personnel, who

We will also allow Armed Forces personnel who
retire before the age of 40 years to enter the
Central Armed Police Forces at suitable levels
based on their qualifications and physical fitness.
Congress promises to substantially expand the
capacity of the Armed Forces medical corps and
hospitals to cater to the needs of ex-servicemen
and their families.

Congress will revise the procedure to determine
the disability of injured armed forces person-
nel and make the determination final subject to
an appeal only at the instance of the disabled
person. All pending appeals filed by the Ministry
of Defence will be withdrawn.

Congress promises to substantially
expand the capacity of the Armed

Forces medical corps and hospitals

servicemen and their families.

 

 

 

Central Armed Police Forces

19

The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) are our first line of defence at our borders. They are
also the force of choice when there is a breakdown of law and order. Thousands of jawans have
sacrificed their lives in the discharge of their duties. Congress promises to enhance the capa-
bilities of the force and to improve the welfare of our jawans.

01. We will increase the strength of the CAPFs to
meet the growing requirements of border security
and internal security

02. At any given time, an adequate number of battal-
ions will be on rest, recuperation and training
and will not be deployed on operational duties.

03. Congress promises to ensure increased repre-
sentation of women to achieve a minimum of
33 per cent in the force strength of CISF, CRPF
and BSF. Every effort will be made to induct more
women into the other border guarding forces,
namely, ITBP. SSB and Assam Rifles.

We will enhance the facilities of health, educa-
tion and housing for the personnel of the CAPFs
and their families to bring them on par with the
facilities provided for the Armed Forces. We will set
up schools on the model of Sainik schools to en-
hance educational opportunities for their children.

. Congress promises to enhance the status of the

jawan and the benefits to the families of jawans in
cases were the jawan dies in action.

We will set up a Committee to draft new Service
Rules for personnel of the CAPFs.

 

Art, Culture and Heritage

20

Art, culture and heritage constitute the identity of a people. A multi-cultural country like India
can be truly proud of our many identities, which deserve to be protected and preserved.

0

. Congress is committed to protecting the rich
diversity of India’s art and culture and to ensuring
it flourishes in an atmosphere of freedom and
creativity. We will resolutely oppose censorship
as well as any attempt to denigrate the art and
culture of any group.

02. Sufficient support and funds will be provided

to preserve and promote the art, culture and

heritage of the groups of people whose identities

are unique and are of anthropological significance.

03.

04.

We will provide fellowships to artists and crafts-
people working in the field of traditional arts and
crafts.

Congress will guarantee artistic freedom. Artists
and craftsmen will enjoy the freedom to express
their views in any form without fear of censorship
or retribution. Attempts by vigilante groups to
censor or intimidate artists will be viewed seriously
and action against them will be taken according

to the law.

ed and empowered to achieve the objects of the
Copyright Act.

The Archaeological Survey of India deserves and
will be provided more funds and human resourc-
es. More historical monuments will be brought
under the care and control of ASI.

 

Tourism

Foreign tourist arrivals in India in 2018 is estimated at about 1 crore. Comparing this number
with the numbers of comparable countries, it indicates substantial under-performance.
Congress will take measures to achieve an annual growth of 20 per cent in tourist arrivals.

Tourism is important for many reasons, the most important being its capacity to create jobs

for people with different levels of education.

Congress promises a special tax regime

for tourism-related businesses and income.

We will establish an adequately capitalised
Tourism Development Bank to provide low-cost,
long-term funds for investment in tourism-related
businesses.

Congress will work with State Governments to
provide, and improve, the infrastructure in

and around places of tourist interest.

Congress will work with State Governments to cre-
ate young volunteer groups to guide and assist
visitors at important places of tourist interest.

India’s Missions abroad will be tasked with
encouraging more visitors to India from the country
to which each Mission is accredited.
Visa-on-Arrival Scheme will be expanded to
include more countries and more categories of
visitors. No fee will be charged for tourist visas

for a period of 3 years.

 

Non-Resident Indians

Congress affirms its belief that non-resident Indians, wherever they live and work,

are an inseparable part of India.

Congress promises to re-establish the

Ministry of Overseas Indians that will be tasked
to address the concerns of NRIs including their
safety, conditions of work, social security and
health benefits, education of their children, need
for financial services and safe return to India.

special attention to work safety and work condi-
tions of Indian citizens in foreign countries. We will

We will review and expand the opportunities for
higher education and review the fee structure for
the children of NRIs in colleges and universities in
India.

Invest Scheme to offer more opportunities and
options to NRIs to invest in India. We will establish
a single point of contact and simplify the proce-
dures to enable NRIs to invest in businesses in
India.

Engaging With Citizens and Civil Society

Congress affirms its belief that civil society organisations and groups are an important pillar of
a parliamentary democracy. During the tenure of the UPA Governments, civil society played a
key role in developing our rights-based agenda. We will continue to engage with civil society
activists and organisations and draw on their experience and knowledge.

Congress promises to re-constitute the National
Integration Council to promote unity, solidarity,
communal harmony, fraternity and reconciliation.
Congress promises to work with the Council to fight
divisive and communal forces that are a danger to
the unity and solidarity of the country.

Congress will set up an Inter-faith Council
consisting of leaders of all religions in order to
promote respect for all religions, mutual toler-
ance and fraternity, to hold inter-faith dialogues,
and enhance cultural exchanges between people
belonging to different religions.

03. We will encourage citizens to form civil society

organisations. We will create an institutional
framework under which Central and State Govern-
ments may consult civil society organisations on
formulating policies, implementing programmes
and obtaining feedback on outcomes.

. Congress will use modern technology along with

traditional brick-and-mortar service centres to
increase the role of civil society organisations
in policy and in decision-making.

Congress will create an institutional
framework under which Central and

Congress will restore the dignity, authority and autonomy of our public
institutions, which has been eroded by the NDA government, while making
them accountable to Parliament. We believe that self-regulation is the
best way to correct the abuse of media freedom. We will amend the Press
Council of India Act, 1978 to strengthen the system of self-regulation,
protect the freedom of journalists, uphold editorial independence and
guard against government interference.

Institutions

Never before have the institutions that underpin a parliamentary democracy been so brazen-
ly undermined, denigrated and captured as in the last 5 years. Examples of this include the
Reserve Bank of India, Central Vigilance Commission, Election Commission of India, Central
Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate, Central Information Commission, National
Statistics Commission and National Human Rights Commission.

Congress promises to restore the
of these institutions while
making them accountable to Parliament. Congress
promises that selection and appointment to these
bodies will be transparent and will be with due
regard to the importance of institutional integrity.
Congress promises to amend the

Federalism and Centre-State Relations

A basic feature of the Constitution of India is the principle of federalism. Congress acknowledges
that, over the last 5 years, this principle has been eroded to the detriment of the States.

Congress believes that a large country like India cannot be administered by the Central
Government alone. In fact, in most matters concerning the daily lives of the people, it is the
State Government that is close to the people and, in some matters, it is the Local Government
(Municipality or Panchayat) that is even closer to the people.

We will review the distribution of legislative fields
in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and
build a consensus on transferring some legislative
fields from List III (Concurrent List) to List II

(State List).

We will reduce the size of Ministries and
Departments in the Central Government in such
areas where sufficient capacity has been built by
the State Governments.

Congress promises to give primacy to State
Governments in subjects such as school educa-
tion, primary and secondary health care, child nu-
trition, drinking water, sanitation and distribution of
electricity, and ensure that the Central Government
plays a supportive role to State Governments.
Congress promises to take forward the idea of

the GST Council of Ministers and establish such
Councils for Agriculture, Education and Healthcare.
We will implement the recommendations of the
Fifteenth Finance Commission and will urge the
States to implement the recommendations of their
respective State Finance Commissions.

Congress, as the author of the 73"" and 74""
Constitution Amendments, will prevail upon the
States to implement those provisions in letter and
spirit and devolve funds, functions and functionar-
ies upon the Panchayats and Municipalities.

We will work with State Governments to empower
Panchayats and Municipalities through devolution
of funds including a share of GST revenues. We
will explore the possibility of direct central grants
to Panchayats and Municipalities that was tried
successfully in 1988-89 under the Government

of Shri Rajiv Gandhi.

Review of Laws, Rules and Regulations

Freedom is the hallmark of our open and democratic Republic. The purpose of law is
regulation in order to strengthen freedom. Laws must be just and reasonable and reflect
our Constitutional values.

Congress believes that we are an over-legislated and over-regulated country. Laws, Rules and
Regulations have proliferated and restricted freedoms. Consequently, there are severe restric-
tions on innovation, enterprise and experimentation, and economic growth has suffered.
Congress will initiate a total and comprehensive review of all laws, rules and regulations to:
a. Repeal instruments that are outdated or unjust or unreasonably restrict the freedoms
of the people;
b. Amend instruments to bring them in accord with the Constitutional values
of a democracy; and
c. Codify and reduce the number of instruments that must be complied with by a citizen.

Specifically, Congress promises to:

Decriminalise laws that are essentially laws direct-
ed against civil violations and can be subjected to
civil penalties;

Perspective Planning and The New Planning Commission

In a federal system comprising States and a Central Government with numerous ministries
and departments administering specific subjects, it is necessary to have an expert body to

a. Independently evaluate competing claims;

b. Mediate between the Central and State Governments and between the Ministry of Finance
and the various departments regarding allocation of funds;

c. Monitor the utilisation of funds; and

d. Assess and evaluate the gap between expenditure and outcomes. The Planning Commission
performed these functions besides other functions. The BJP Government's decision to abol-
ish the Planning Commission was thoughtless and absurd.

, which has
proved to be a noisy and incompetent intermed-
dler. Congress promises to constitute a Planning
Commission with re-defined responsibilities such
as to formulate medium and long-term perspective
plans and to function as an independent expert
body to perform crucial functions in a federal
system.

02. Congress promises that the new Planning Commis-

sion will be a with renowned
economists and financial experts as members as-
sisted by a small but high-quality team of scholars
from different fields and support staff totalling a
maximum of 100 persons.

Congress will pass the Constitution (Amendment) Bill to provide for
reservation of 33 per cent of seats in thé Lok Sabha and State Legislative
Assemblies in the first Session of the 1/7"" Lok Sabha and in the Rajya
Sabha. We will amend the Service Rules to,reserve for women 33 per cent
of appointments to posts in the Central Government.

Women’s Empowerment and Gender Justice

Historically, Congress has been at the forefront of the struggle for women’s rights, equality
and empowerment. India’s only woman Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, belonged to the
Congress. We passed many laws that empowered women. We mainstreamed gender in

government schemes.

Congress promises to pass the Constitution
(Amendment) Bill to provide for reservation of

33 per cent of seats in the Lok Sabha and State

17"" Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha.

We will amend the Service Rules to reserve for
women 33 per cent of appointments to posts

ment for the economic empowerment of women,
to increase livelihood opportunities and to usher
in transformative social change.

We will work with State Governments to imple-
ment a programme to provide single, widowed,
divorced, abandoned or destitute women a

a créche in every Anganwadi based on need

Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other

Backward Classes

The Constitution of India provides for reservation in employment and educational institutions
for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. We must do even
more to ensure justice to the historically disadvantaged sections of our people.

Congress promises a holistic agenda of affirmative
action for SCs, STs and OBCs who constitute a little
more than 75 per cent of the population. Hence,
Congress promises to set up an Equal Oppor-

Special attention will be paid to the educational
and health needs of the Scheduled Tribes.

Component Plan for SCs and Tribal Sub-Plan
for STs and to prohibit diversion of such funds.

 

Jammu & Kashmir

Congress has stood witness to the developments in Jammu & Kashmir since the Instrument

of Accession was signed on 26 October 1947. Congress affirms that the whole of Jammu &
Kashmir is part of India. We also acknowledge the unique history of the State and the unique
circumstances under which the State acceded to India that led to the inclusion of Article 370 in
the Constitution of India. Nothing will be done or allowed to change the Constitutional position.

Congress has long held the view that dialogue is
the only way to understand the aspirations of the
people of the 3 regions of Jammu & Kashmir and
find an honourable solution to their issues. We will
take that path.

We will adopt a two-pronged approach: first-

ly, uncompromising firmness on the border and
ending infiltration; and secondly, absolute fairness
in dealing with the demands of the people and
winning their hearts and minds.

Congress promises to review the deployment of
armed forces, move more troops to the border to
stop infiltration completely, reduce the presence
of the Army and CAPFs in the Kashmir Valley, and
entrust more responsibility to the J&K police for
maintaining law and order.

04.

06.

The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and
the Disturbed Areas Act in J&K will be reviewed.
Suitable changes will be made in the text of the
laws to balance the requirements of security and
the protection of human rights.

Building a Union of States that is India is a project
of inclusiveness. Jammu & Kashmir and its prob-
lems deserve a large-hearted approach that will
eschew muscular militarism and legalistic formu-
lations and look for an innovative federal solution.
Congress promises to find such a solution through
patient dialogue and talks with all stakeholders in
the State.

Congress promises the people of J&K talks without
pre-conditions. We will appoint 3 interlocutors
drawn from civil society to facilitate such talks.

We are deeply concerned about the cases of
discrimination and harassment of students,

and their right to study or do business.

 

North Eastern States

Congress affirms that the North Eastern States (NES) are a unique and valued part of India
that bring into our Union many diverse and rich cultures, languages, traditions and bio-diver-
sity. We are committed to defending and protecting the interests of the NES and their people
and to ensuring the rapid economic development of the region.

ry status to the NES.

Congress promises an industrial policy for the
NES.

We will withdraw immediately the widely resented
Citizenship Amendment Bill introduced by the
BJP Government against the wishes of the people
of the NES.

We will ensure that no citizen of India is denied in-
clusion in the final National Register of Citizens.
We will address the issue of illegal immigra-
tion into the NES through consultation with the
NES and evolve a consensus on the legislative
measures that will secure the identity of the
indigenous communities. We will also engage the
neighbouring countries, Bangladesh and Myanmar,
to address and resolve the issue of illegal immi-
gration into India.

Congress will strengthen the security of the bor-
ders of the NES with Bangladesh, Myanmar and
China, resolve any border issues through dialogue
with the neighbouring countries and make the bor-
ders ‘borders of prosperity and growth;’ and

We will resolve the pending inter-state issues,
including boundary issues, in the NES through
dialogue or mediation.

The importance of border trade to the economy
of the NES cannot be overstated. Regular export
and import trade will also create huge economic
opportunities, including more jobs, in the NES.

We promise to take bold and innovative measures
to enhance trade in general, and border trade in
particular, with neighbouring countries and other
countries further to the east.

Religious And Linguistic Minorities

The strength and vibrancy of a true democracy are often judged by the rights and protection
accorded to its minorities. In the last 5 years under the BJP Government, hate crimes and
atrocities against the minorities and other vulnerable sections of the people have increased
manifold. The perpetrators of these crimes walk on the streets with impunity.

Congress promises to uphold the rights of reli-
gious minorities: to non-discrimination, to equal
opportunity in employment, to religious freedom
and to establish educational institutions guaran-
teed under Articles 15, 16, 25, 26, 28, 29 and 30
of the Constitution.

We also promise to uphold the rights of linguistic
minorities: to non-discrimination, to equal oppor-
tunity in employment and to establish educational
institutions guaranteed under Articles 15, 16, 29
and 30 of the Constitution.

ensure that the decennial census accurately
enumerates the number of people claiming a lan-
guage as their mother tongue or as their preferred
spoken language.

Congress promises to support the promotion of all
the languages of our country including languages
not included in the Eighth Schedule of the Consti-
tution. We will encourage, as far as possible, the
use of such languages, including the languages

of Scheduled Tribes and Nomadic Tribes, in the
administration of areas where such languages are
widely spoken by the people.

We support the use of Sign Language that is
used by millions of people with disabilities.

tion is best imparted in the mother tongue of the

tongue as the preferred medium of instruction.
We will also support the efforts of State Govern-
ments to teach the official language(s) of the
State, as well as Hindi and English to children of
that State.

. We will pass a new law in the first session of the

17"" Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha to prevent
and punish hate crimes such as mob-engineered
stripping, burning and lynching. The law will con-
tain provisions to compensate the victims and to
hold accountable the police and district administra-
tion for proven negligence.

The Waqf Properties (Eviction of Unauthorized
Occupants) Bill, 2014 will be re-introduced and
passed. Waqf properties will be restored to the
legal trustees.

Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia
Islamia as minority educational institutions.

Congress promises to ensure the effective imple-
mentation of the judgment in the Navtej Singh
Johar case. We will protect the rights of the

Healthcare

Healthcare, is a public good. Full healthcare is the right of every citizen—

child, adult and senior citizen.

Providing healthcare is a shared responsibility of the Central and State Governments. We
recognise that the principal responsibility for providing primary and secondary healthcare
lies with the State Governments and the principal responsibility for providing tertiary and
super-specialty healthcare lies with the Central Government.

. Congress promises that the total government

expenditure on healthcare will be doubled to

3 per cent of GDP by the year 2023-24. The
Annual Budgets will indicate the step up in each
year in order to achieve the target in 2023-24.
Congress promises to enact the Right to Health-
care Act that will guarantee to every citizen

the right to healthcare services, including free
diagnostics, out-patient care, medicines and
hospitalisation through a network of public
hospitals and enlisted private hospitals.

promises to vigorously promote and implement
the free public hospitals-model to provide
universal healthcare.

Congress will substantially expand the free
Dial-an-Ambulance service and put on the
road more ambulances in all the districts of India.

. Trauma and Emergency Centres will be estab-

lished on all National and State Highways to cater
to the travelling public as well as the population
in the surrounding area.

Act, 2010 to bring accountability to the function-
ing of private and public clinical establishments.

mandate, the digitisation of medical records
on the foundation of a robust ICT infrastructure
with suitable provisions for privacy, mobility and
inter-operability.

We promise to formulate a National Telemedi-
cine Policy based on international best practices.

10.

India’s current doctor to population ratio is 1:1681
and government doctor to population ratio is
1:11,528. Congress promises to increase the

colleges, increasing the capacity of medical
colleges and providing scholarships and loans

to medical students.

. Congress promises to license pre-qualified

institutions in the public sector and private sector
to teach and certify medical professionals such
as nurses, paramedics and medical technicians.

. We will promote AYUSH, the Indian systems of

medicine, in the provision of healthcare services
and especially in preventive healthcare.

. Congress will implement a programme that will

enable State Governments to revamp and equip
the network of primary health centres (PHCs).

Education

Education is a merit good and must be available to all children as a public good. Congress
promises that State and Central Governments shall be responsible for providing educational
opportunities to all children. Schools, colleges and universities shall be, mostly, public institu-
tions funded through public resources. Private educational institutions may supplement public

educational institutions.

Congress will propose that School Education

be transferred to the State List in the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution while retaining the
subject of Higher Education in the Union List.
Congress promises that school education from
Class | to Class XII in public schools shall be
compulsory and free. Suitable amendments will
be made in the Right to Education Act, 2009. We
will end the practice of charging special fees for
different purposes in public schools.

We are deeply concerned about the quality of ed-
ucation and poor learning outcomes as reported
in the Annual Survey of Education Report (ASER).
Congress promises to attach the highest impor-
tance to learning outcomes.

The teacher is the pivot around whom the entire
system of education revolves. Teacher training

and the continuing education of teachers are the
key to quality instruction. Congress promises to
increase the capacity, number and quality of Teach-
er Training Institutes set up by the government.
Regulation of Teacher Training Institutes will be the
responsibility of the National Council for Teacher
Education and their funding will be the responsi-
bility of the University Grants Commission or its
successor. A scheme for the periodic and continu-
ing education of teachers will be implemented and
teachers will be required to mandatorily participate
in the scheme.

Congress promises to double the allocation for
Education to 6 per cent of GDP in the 5 years
ending 2023-24. A path forward will be laid down
in the regular Budget for 2019-20 and specific
annual targets will be set.

The Right to Education Act brought to the fore criti-
cal deficiencies in the school systems across the
country. In States where the Act was implemented
well, many of these deficiencies were rectified. But
much remains to be done, especially in the educa-
tionally backward districts of the States. Congress
promises increased expenditure to provide basic
and adequate infrastructure in every school from
Class | to Class XII that will include classrooms,
library, laboratory, playground, toilets, drinking
water, etc. Hostels will be constructed based

on demand.

Congress promises to increase the number of

based on demand and with the co-operation
of the State Governments.

. It is a matter of grave concern that children drop

out of school. We promise to arrest this trend and
ensure that every child completes 12 years of
school education.

In order to ensure a uniform quality of education
and to improve learning outcomes, Congress prom-
ises to employ technology-enabled teaching
methods and technology-driven, personalised and
adaptive learning tools in all schools.

Most children stop with school education. In

order to make children ready for employment or
self-employment, Congress promises to introduce
vocational training as a compulsory component
of school education in Classes IX to XII.

Congress will support the establishment of
special schools for children with special needs.
India needs more Universities. Congress promises
to establish more public universities in the country,
especially in under-served areas.

We promise to restore the autonomy of colleges
and universities.

We will entrust the Regulation, Grading and
Funding of colleges and universities to sepa-
rate organisations. We will provide The University
Grants Commission or its successor with sufficient
funds to make liberal grants to colleges and uni-
versities, based on need and merit.

We promise to take suitable measures to include
Guest, Temporary and Contract Teachers in the
regular establishment of Universities so that they
receive the benefits due to them.

We promise to restore the 200-point roster
system for appointments to central universities
and other central institutes of higher learning.
Congress deeply respects teachers and will
ensure that serving teachers are represented in
the governing bodies of colleges and universities.
Congress promises to establish more Institutes
of Higher Learning in subjects such as medicine,
engineering, commerce, management and pure
sciences.

. We will increase the Gross Enrollment Ratio

(GER) in Higher Education from the current level
of 25.8 to the level of at least 40 in a period of
5 years.

The NEET examination is discriminatory against
students from certain States. In addition, it inter-
feres with the State Government's right to admit
students domiciled in the State to medical colleges
in that State. Hence, we will take measures to
dispense with the NEET examination and substi-
tute it with a State-level examination of equivalent
standard, approved by the competent authority for
admission to medical colleges in that State.
Colleges and Universities will be encouraged to
award Deprivation Points to students seeking
admission based on gender, permanent residence
in rural districts, first generation learner, etc. and
to admit such students to ensure diversity in the
classroom.
College and University education must be fund-
ed in multiple ways. We promise to increase the
amount earmarked for grants to colleges and
universities.

. Congress promises to increase the number of
scholarships offered to students. Colleges and
universities will be encouraged to build endow-

. We will revive, redesign and expand the Education
Loan programme. Applications will be received,
examined and sanctioned on a single portal and
then assigned to the branch of a bank located
near the applicant’s residence or place of study for
documentation and monitoring. No interest will be
charged during the period of study and until the
student finds a job or earns through self-employ-
ment. Outstanding interest dues on old education
loans as on 31 March 2019 will be waived.

. Congress will pass a Students Rights Bill to
codify the rights and obligations of students
in colleges and universities.

 

Food and Nutrition Security

The passage of the National Food Security Act, 2013 by the UPA Government was a revolu-
tionary step that linked Wealth (the Green Revolution) to Welfare (assurance of food security).

Congress promises to work tirelessly to assure
food security to all.

Some Tribal communities and groups are partic-
ularly vulnerable. We will pay special attention to
them and ensure that food grains are delivered to
them through mobile fair price shops.

We will review and update the list of beneficia-
ries within 6 months. Care shall be taken to in-
clude the homeless, destitute persons and migrant
workers. No eligible person shall be excluded.
Congress promises to take special measures to
enroll vulnerable tribal groups and tribal com-
munities.

Congress will ensure that the linking of Aadhaar
will be voluntary but encouraged. No one shall

be excluded because of non-linking of Aadhaar.

06.

07.

The quality and delivery of the Mid-Day Meal
Scheme will be improved. Milk and eggs shall be
included in the meal. The cost allowed for a Mid-
Day Meal shall be increased. There will be a social
audit of the scheme at the block and district levels
and the outcomes, in terms of nutrition levels of
the children, will be measured and monitored.
The public food distribution programmes
(Mid-Day Meal Scheme, ICDS etc.) will rely, as

far as possible, on fresh produce. This will
encourage local production and provide a fillip

to local markets.

 

Child Welfare

Children are the most valuable human resource of a country. Congress believes that it is the
duty of the Central and State Governments to ensure that every child enjoys all the rights of

a child, especially complete education and full health.

Congress promises to expand the ICDS pro-
gramme, increase funding support and increase
the number of Anganwadis. Anganwadi workers
shall be paid atleast the State minimum wage.
Based on need and demand, Anganwadis will
include a créche to provide day care to small
children and to empower working mothers.
Nutritious food is the mainstay of the ICDS
programme. We will closely monitor the coverage
and quality of the programme. There will be a
social audit of the outcomes pertaining to the
improvement of children’s nutrition levels.

. We will ensure that every child is vaccinated.

Complete education is dependent on learning

of school education. The ASER Report is an indict-
ment of the quality of instruction in many schools.
Congress will work with State Governments to en-
sure that a child receives a good quality education
and that this is reflected in learning outcomes.
Crimes against children, especially sexual
violence, are crimes against humanity. Congress
promises to take a serious view of such crimes. The
number of POCSO courts will be increased, trials
will be put on fast track and the guilty punished.
Congress promises to revamp and improve

Child Protection Services with a focus on
vulnerable groups of children, the prevention

of crimes against children, and the after-care

and rehabilitation of child victims.

 

Water Management, Sanitation and Hygiene

Access to water and sanitation are basic human rights. Congress promises to address
the challenges of water and sanitation through advocacy, technology and legislation.

Congress promises universal access to potable
drinking water. The National Drinking Water
Mission will be reviewed and strengthened.

Budget allocations will be substantially increased.
Congress recognises the challenge of water scarcity
and promises to create a Ministry of Water to
bring all water-related activities and departments
under one authority.

03.

We will pay special attention to access to water
and democratic sharing of water. We will address
these issues by focusing on storage in dams and
water bodies, replenishing ground water and
creating a large participatory programme of water
management involving the State Governments,
civil society organisations, farmers, other users,
Panchayats and Gram Sabhas.

Congress promises to double the budget allocation
for cleaning rivers, including the Ganga. Congress
promises to review the current methodology for
cleaning rivers and to strengthen efforts by em-
ploying the latest advances in science and technol-
ogy. We will convert the Ganga Action Plan into a
People’s Programme and implement the same.
Congress will review and re-introduce the Nirmal
Bharat Abhiyan (NBA) to ensure universal access
to a clean, functioning toilet with water. Instead of
chasing numbers, Congress promises that NBA will
support the construction of individual toilets (that
will be the responsibility of the household) as well
as community toilets (that will be the responsibili-
ty of pre-qualified NGOs).

We will implement a comprehensive plan for

the treatment and safe disposal of sewage.

07.

08.

Congress promises to focus on hygiene, including
menstrual hygiene, by promoting hand washing,
use of disposable tissue paper and low-cost
sanitary napkins. Panchayats, Municipalities and
NGOs will be supported to install sanitary napkin
vending machines in schools, colleges and select
public places.

Congress promises to end the evil of manual
scavenging in 3 years. Every manual scavenger
will be rehabilitated, re-skilled, provided a job and
assured a life of dignity and safety. The Prohibition
of Manual Scavenging Act, 2013 will be strictly
implemented and any person employing anyone
for manual scavenging shall be punished. We will
allocate sufficient funds to enable the procurement
of machines that will clean sewers and septic tanks
and remove human waste.

 

Environment And Climate Change

Congress was the first Indian political party to acknowledge the consequences of
Climate Change (Smt. Indira Gandhi in Stockholm on 14 June 1972).

It is a bitter truth that India’s environment has deteriorated. The 2018 Global Environmental
Performance Index placed India at rank 177 out of 180 countries. The BJP Government has
done virtually nothing in the last 5 years to arrest this decline.

Congress promises an action agenda that will place
India at the forefront of the battle against global
warming and for the protection of the environ-
ment. At the same time, Congress will defend and
advance India’s interests in international negotia-
tions on Climate Change and the Environment.

We will constitute, by law, an independent, em-
powered and transparent Environment Protection
Authority (EPA) to establish, monitor and enforce
environmental standards and regulations. The EPA
will replace all other bodies that currently exercise
jurisdiction and powers.

Congress recognises that air pollution is a
national public health emergency. We will
significantly strengthen the National Clean Air Pro-
gramme in order to urgently tackle the problem of
pollution. All major sources of emission will be
targetted, mitigated and reduced to acceptable
levels. Sectoral emission standards will be set.

We will formulate a comprehensive land and
water use policy and plan that will include
measures for the conservation of ecosystems

and the bio-diversity and wildlife contained
therein, without affecting the legitimate rights

of local communities.

We will work closely with the State Governments
concerned to preserve the rich bio-diversity of

the Himalayan range and the Western Ghats.
However, the livelihood opportunities of the people
living in these mountains will be protected.
Congress will join hands with State Governments to
stop, fully and finally, the discharge of effluents
into the rivers and to clean all the rivers of India.
Congress promises to protect the coastal zones

of the country. Recent steps that diluted the coast-
al zone regulations will be reversed. The coast

will be preserved without affecting the livelihood
opportunities of fishing communities.

We will impose a complete ban on the import

of all types of waste.

We will allow the import of sand for construction
and stop the illegal mining of sand in riverbanks.
We will implement a solid waste management
plan in every habitation, village, town and city
employing modern technology and machinery.
Those engaged in waste management and disposal
will be assured appropriate equipment, dignity and
safe working conditions.

Congress will confer legal and financial powers
upon Panchayats and Municipalities to enable
them to partner with State Governments in envi-
ronment protection and management and to
convert the total effort into a grassroots movement
involving youth, women, communities and NGOs.

Climate Resilience and Disaster Management

It is not possible to eradicate poverty without tackling the dual threats of climate change
and natural disasters. It is the poor who suffer most on account of natural disasters and
climate change.

Disaster Management Act, 2005 and incorporate

sports policy will aim to inculcate in our citizens, especially students and youth, the culture of
sports and fitness and will encourage sports as a career.

India has suffered terribly over the last 5 years.

We are stuck in a sluggish economy; we are stuck in
joblessness; we are stuck in an unprecedented rural
crisis; we are stuck in a divided society; and we are
stuck in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.

We have a lot of work to do to correct the harm
done in the last 5 years to our people, our freedoms,
our economy, our institutions, and our spirit of
togetherness. The Congress is once again ready

to take on this challenge and this responsibility.

We promise to repair the damage caused by
a callous, divisive and deceitful BJP Government.

We promise to put India back on the path of
growth and development, not take her backwards.

We promise to empower every man,
woman and child, not inflict distress.

 

We promise to provide leadership that brings
people together, not one which divides.

We are a party that lives up to its promises, not
one that deceives you with hollow jumlas at election
time. With us, you will be sure of a bright future
filled with hope for you and your children.

It is now time for you to make a choice.

With utmost humility, faith in our capacity to deliver,
and unflinching courage to take on every challenge,
we appeal to you to join hands with the Congress.
Let us rebuild India. Together, let us get India
moving again.

Remember:
We have delivered before.
We will deliver again!

V. An Appeal

I. Preface
Elections to the 15"" Lok Sabha are to be held shortly.
This is the time for you to choose your government at the Centre.

The Indian National Congress respectfully seeks a renewed mandate from
the people. We pledge to continue our work to ensure a life of SECURITY,
DIGNITY AND PROSPERITY for every citizen.

The Indian National Congress seeks this mandate on the strength of the
performance of the Congress-led UPA government during 2004-09.

We made promises in our manifesto of 2004.
We have delivered on them in a very substantial measure.

The Indian National Congress seeks a fresh mandate on the basis of its core
values and ideology — secularism, nationalism, social justice, and economic
growth for all, especially for the the aam admi.

We seek a fresh mandate on the basis of our heritage, record of service and
vision of the future. We reaffirm our unflinching commitment to the welfare
of all our people, especially to the well-being of the weaker sections of our
society.

The Indian National Congress is the only party that appeals to, and derives
its strength from, each and every section of our society.

The Indian National Congress is the only party that believes that economic
growth and communal harmony, and economic growth and social justice, are
two sides of the same coin and must always go hand-in-hand.

The Indian National Congress is the only party that combines experience and
youth, wisdom and exuberance, achievement and ambition.

Il. Why Congress?
These are national elections.

While there will be regional, state-level and local issues that are important,
these are elections for a government at the Centre, one that will govern all of
India in its many diversities and fulfill its multitude of hopes and aspirations.

It is only the Indian National Congress that is anchored in the larger vision of
India as a nation, while at the same time being sensitive to regional and local
sentiments.

It is only the Indian National Congress that has demonstrated its
commitment to a strong Centre, to strong States, and to strong panchayats

and nagarpalikas. India’s political system must have space for institutions at
each of these three levels. Each has a vital and specific role to play.

The Indian National Congress is fighting these elections in alliance with like-
minded parties in some States. These parties share the progressive vision
and values of the Congress. Over the past five years, the Indian National
Congress has managed a_ coalition government at the _ Centre,
accommodating the views of its partners but without compromising on any
of the essential principles of nation-building.

Even so, what India needs most today -- what every Indian needs most today
- at the national level is a party with an All-India perspective and with an All-
India presence. The Indian National Congress is the only such party.

The Indian National Congress is the party that, under the leadership of
Mahatma Gandhi, led our people into freedom from colonial rule. It is the
party whose leadership, by the admission of Dr. Ambedkar himself, made our
Constitution possible.

The Indian National Congress is the party that, under the leadership of
Jawaharlal Nehru, established the foundations of the modern Indian nation-
state with its abiding commitment to parliamentary democracy, secularism,
economic development, and science and technology.

Learning from experience at every step, the Indian National Congress is the
party that has responded creatively to the challenges of the times through
the establishment of a vast public sector manufacturing base in the fifties;
through bank nationalization and the Green and White Revolutions
spearheaded by Indira Gandhi in the late-sixties and seventies; through
prudent liberalization and the IT Revolution created by Rajiv Gandhi in the
eighties; bolder economic reforms in the nineties; and unprecedented
economic growth over the past five years. It is the only party that is forward-
looking, the only party that believes a better future is the right of every
Indian.

The achievements of India since 1947 are the achievements of its people - of
its farmers and farm labour, its organized sector and unorganized sector
workers, its managers, its scientists and engineers, its teachers, doctors and
other professionals, its entrepreneurs and businesspersons. It has been the
privilege of the Indian National Congress to have provided the political
leadership that heralded these accomplishments under the Prime
Ministerships of Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv
Gandhi, Narasimha Rao and Dr. Manmohan Singh.

Congress vs’ BJP: Secular, Liberal Nationalism vs Narrow
Communalism

The Indian National Congress has always been in the forefront of the battle
against those forces that seek to divide and fragment our society.

The Indian National Congress has always been the bulwark against the four
“isms” that threaten to tear our country apart -- communalism of all kinds,
linguistic chauvinism, regional parochialism and casteism.

At the national level, the BJP has sought to position itself as the main political
rival of the Indian National Congress.

The Indian National Congress rejects this presumptuous posturing since the
BJP is simply not present in large parts of our country.

Even so, the contest between the Indian National Congress and the BJP is not
just a fight between two political parties.

It is, in essence, a clash between two competing visions of Indian
nationalism, between two competing visions of what India should be.

The Indian National Congress’s secular and liberal nationalism has an equal
place for each and every Indian. It is an inclusive vision. The BJP’s narrow
and communal nationalism denies equality and equal rights to large
sections of our people. It is an exclusionary doctrine.

The Indian National Congress’s secular and liberal nationalism is founded on
a celebration of India’s many diversities. The BJP’s narrow and communal
nationalism rejects many of these diversities and seeks to impose an
artificial uniformity on our people.

The Indian National Congress practices the politics of consensus and
cooperation. The BJP practices the politics of divisiveness and discord.
Instinctively, the Indian National Congress unites, while the BJP divides.

Third Front - a recipe for chaos

There is also the so-called Third Front, a grouping of opportunistic parties.
These parties have neither consistency nor clarity. They have neither
competence nor commitment. This Front, grounded in the politics of
convenience, is nothing but a platform for personal ambitions. It speaks of
“alternative polices” without spelling out what these alternatives are. Parties
of the Third Front do one thing when they are in power and quite another
when they are rejected by the people.

The Left Parties, who are prime movers behind the so-called Third Front,
supported the Congress-led UPA government for over four years. They
attempted to exercise authority without taking on any responsibility. At
every step, they violated the discipline, restraint and sobriety so very
essential for running a coalition smoothly. At every step, the Prime Minister,
Dr. Manmohan Singh, briefed them on all important issues. The Left Parties

5

withdrew their support on the issue of the civilian nuclear agreement even
though it had been negotiated and concluded on our own terms. They
adamantly refused to listen to reasoned arguments that convincingly
demonstrated that the agreement was in India’s supreme national interest.

The Left Parties and their present partners pride themselves on being
secular. On the contrary, it may be recalled that they had actively aligned
with the BJP in the past. They are, in fact, responsible for the electoral
growth of the BJP.

As past experience has shown, the Third Front is a recipe for political
instability. Lacking a natural national anchor, it is a recipe for chaos, not
cohesion.

Only a united India can fight terrorism

The integrity and security of India are paramount. Terrorism threatens many
countries, including India.

Terrorism knows no religion and it respects no political boundary. It is, as has
become painfully evident, not confined to any community or any political
persuasion. Its method is the mindless use of violence directed at the
innocent in the most cowardly manner.

Let it be very clear — terrorism must be fought relentlessly, intelligently and
wisely, and without fear or favour.

Terrorism can be fought only by a united people, not by a people divided by
religion. Religious polarization that is intrinsic to the BJP severely erodes our
capacity to combat terrorism.

It is only the Indian National Congress that can deal with the scourge of
terrorism squarely and decisively but without weakening the delicate strands
that have, together, bound our society for centuries.

Dealing with terrorism aided and abetted from across our borders does not
require a “muscular” foreign policy as advocated by the BJP. The country
knows the heavy price that was paid for such a “muscular” foreign policy—
stupor in Kargil, surrender in Kandahar and stalemate in Operation
Parakram.

What India needs is an intelligent and wise foreign policy, a foreign policy
that is rooted in our traditions, gives us strength through our unity and
common purpose, and radiates confidence.

After the November 2008 attacks on Mumbai, the Congress-led UPA
government mounted a forceful diplomatic campaign. It was this campaign
that led to Pakistan admitting, for the first time, that Pakistani citizens were

responsible for the attacks. That admission was a notable victory for our well
thought out foreign policy.

The Middle Path - the Congress’s way

Balance—or the middle path--has always been the hall-mark of the policies of
the Indian National Congress.

As the world experiences a severe recession, it is this balance that is
standing India in good stead.

It is a balance between the public sector and the private sector, with an
important role assigned to cooperatives and self-help groups.

It is a balance between building a modern economy and imparting a new
thrust to traditional industries.

It is a balance between promoting employment in the organized sector and
protecting livelihoods in the unorganized sector.

It is a balance between addressing the needs of urban India and improving
the quality of life and standard of living in our villages and towns.

It is a balance between taking advantage of globalization and ensuring that
these benefits flow to local communities.

It is a balance between regulation by the government and unleashing the
creative spirits of our entrepreneurs and professionals.

It is only the Indian National Congress that cherishes and practices this
balance in all spheres of our national life including in the conduct of
economic and foreign policy.

This balance is needed now more than ever.

lll. Achievements of the Congress-led UPA Government

The tireless campaign of Smt. Sonia Gandhi, President of the Indian National
Congress resulted in its return to the 14 Lok Sabha as the single largest
party after eight years in the Opposition. She took the initiative to give
shape to the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) comprising of the Indian
National Congress, its pre-poll allies and supporting like-minded parties. As
chairperson of the UPA, Smt. Sonia Gandhi, along with Prime Minister Dr.
Manmohan Singh, negotiated a Common Minimum Programme that became
the basis of governance of the coalition.

The May 2004 mandate was for a government that would be responsive to
the concerns of the aam admi and to the needs of the poor, the deprived and
the disadvantaged.

This has been achieved in very substantial measure.

The May 2004 mandate was for a government that would accelerate
economic growth but with a focus always on livelihoods and jobs, on
inclusive growth and on social justice.

This has been achieved in very substantial measure.

The May 2004 mandate was for a government that would take forward the
agenda of empowerment of the weaker sections of society in a forthright
manner with emphasis on education.

This has been achieved in substantial measure.

The May 2004 mandate was for a government that would bridge all divides,
that would bring all sections of society together, and give them voice.

This has been achieved in substantial measure.
We let the record speak for itself.
The Major Accomplishments: 2004-2009

The accomplishments of the Congress-led UPA government since May 2004
have been tangible and visible. The manifesto of the Indian National
Congress for the 2004 Lok Sabha elections provided the foundation for the
National Common Minimum Programme that formed the basis of governance
during the past five years. The pledges made in this manifesto have been
translated into reality by the Congress-led UPA government.

¢ It has restored secular and Constitutional values in governance. It has
also made administration markedly more transparent. The Right to
Information Act, 2005 is a historic legislation. It is enabling lakhs of our
citizens in villages, towns and cities to demand responsiveness and
accountability from public officials and government at all levels.

* It has enacted the path-breaking National Rural Employment
Guarantee Act which is being implemented in all districts to provide
100 days of legally guaranteed employment to each rural household
seeking employment in public works programmes. Not only has
livelihood security been provided to many lakh poor rural families but
durable community assets have also been created.

¢ It has started and achieved considerable progress on the ambitious
Bharat Nirman programme to transform rural India by expanding and

providing irrigation, all-weather roads, houses for the poor, drinking
water, electricity for all poor families and phone connectivity in all
villages.

It has brought comfort and hope to crores of our farmers and their
families by (i) increasing the MSP and procurement prices; (ii) by
waiving loans to the tune of Rs 65,000 crores; (iii) by increasing three-
fold credit from banks and reducing interest rates on crop loans; and
(iv) by extending irrigation facilities.

It has launched the National Rural Health Mission which has already
made a positive impact by improving the quality and accessibility of
primary health care in villages. More children are now being delivered
under the care of trained health professionals. Around six and a half
lakh women have been trained and posted as accredited social health
activists (ASHAs).

It has significantly empowered the weaker sections of society by (i)
giving scheduled tribes and traditional forest dwellers rights over land
they cultivate in forest areas; (ii) by providing reservations for OBC
students in all professional institutions; (iii) by passing a new law to
protect women from domestic violence; (iv) by giving women equal
rights to inherit property; and (v) by enhancing hugely the scholarships
for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, minorities and OBCs to pursue
college and university education.

It has imparted a new momentum to the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan for
primary education. It has also introduced a cooked mid-day meal
scheme in all primary schools that feeds 15 crore children every day.
At the same time, it has for the first time in five decades, increased the
number of colleges, universities, and institutes of technology,
management and information technology. The investment in higher
education in the Xith Five Year Plan (2007-08 to 2011-12) will witness a
huge increase - five times the investment in the previous five years.

It has delivered five years of record economic growth. This has enabled
an unprecedented step-up in government spending particularly on (i)
education and health; (ii) on agriculture and rural development; (iii)
infrastructure like power and railways; and (iv) municipal services in
towns and cities. This economic growth has enabled the introduction of
the Aam Admi Bima Yojana (life insurance cover) for one and a half
crore landless households, the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana
(medical insurance cover) for six crore unorganized sector workers
living below the poverty line and the Indira Gandhi National Old Age
Pension scheme for elder citizens over 65 years of age and living below
the poverty line.

It has initiated the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission
QNNURM) with an outlay of Rs.1 lakh crore in 63 cities for upgrading
infrastructure and for providing basic services to the urban poor. Work
amounting to over Rs.42,000 crore is in progress covering areas like
water supply, sanitation and urban transport. 14 lakh houses for the
poor are under construction. Governance reforms under JNNURM has
increased the availability of housing in the 63 cities. A major
programme for improving power supply in 1,420 towns and cities has
also begun.

It has ensured that all States in the country received financial
resources from the Centre for development schemes and programmes
at a scale never known before. Unlike the NDA’s record during
1999-2004, no State has faced discrimination in the matter of funds
from the Central Government. Sensitive States of the northeast and
Jammu and Kashmir have benefited enormously and are seeing
development activities on a very large scale. For the first time, the
Backward Regions Grant Fund with an annual allocation of over Rs
5000 crores for 250 of the poorest districts is being implemented
through panchayats.

It has earned for India a new respect and stature internationally. Civil
nuclear agreements have been entered into with many countries
entirely on our terms. India has today a place of honour in every global
forum. The sustained campaign led by the Congress President has
resulted in the declaration of Gandhi Jayanti as International Day of
Non-Violence by the United Nations.

It has considerably strengthened the country’s capacity and capability
to deal with both external and internal security challenges. New
battalions have been raised and new hubs for anti-terrorist forces
created across the country. A new National Investigation Agency has
also been established. Significant success has been recorded in the
fight against insurgency in some northeastern States and J&K. The
record turnout in the recent assembly polls in J&K by people braving
calls of boycott and threats of violence is a tribute to their desire for
peace and a vindication of the approach adopted by the Indian
National Congress and the Prime Minister personally. The security
forces have also successfully foiled the plans of Naxalites to expand
their nefarious activities. We have raised our level of preparedness to
meet any terrorist threat or attack.

10

V. The Way Forward

The Indian National Congress says what it means and means what it says.

The Indian National Congress promises what it can do and will do what it
promises.

The Indian National Congress is irrevocably committed to ensuring that
government functions in the interest of the people for whom it exists and for
whom it works.

The Indian National Congress has always believed that the correct approach
to governance is to address the daily concerns of the people and solve their
problems. It is to be responsive and accountable to the needs of the people.
It is that governance is a partnership between the electors and the elected
and that the perceived gap between the people and those in power must be
significantly narrowed.

Dr Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister has led the country with dignity and
firm resolve. His integrity, maturity and wisdom, together with his unique
expertise and experience, makes him best qualified to lead the nation and
handle the many challenges that India faces, both at home and abroad.

Towards faster and more inclusive growth

The Indian National Congress is fully aware that the world economy faces
the worst crisis in 50 years. This crisis has been caused by a failure of
financial markets in the USA and in other developed countries. However, the
Indian economy has shown considerable resilience under the most adverse
international circumstances. This is the outcome of the policies of successive
Congress governments. This is the direct result of a vibrant public sector that
is the legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru, government ownership of banks that is the
legacy of Indira Gandhi, and a strong private sector that matured and
flowered during the tenure of Rajiv Gandhi and thereafter.

The average rate of economic growth during the self-declared India Shining
period of the BJP was just 5.8% per year, as compared to 8.5% during the
five year tenure of the Congress-led UPA government. 2008-09 has proved to
be a difficult year for growth, yet the Indian economy will grow at about 7%.
That is why our immediate priority is to revive the economy and restore the
high growth witnessed in the first four years of the Congress-led UPA
Government.

The Indian National Congress will put in place measures to ensure that the
momentum of growth is maintained. Three stimulus packages have already
been announced. Interest rates have been reduced. Credit flows to industry

11

have been encouraged and assured. The impact of these policies will be felt
in the coming weeks and months.

The focus of the new measures will be to stimulate demand in the domestic
economy and to ensure that there is more purchasing power in the hands of
the people and more liquidity in the hands of companies. Public investment
in agriculture and infrastructure, which has increased appreciably over the
past five years, will be stepped up further. Within 45 days of forming the new
Government, the Indian National Congress will present the regular Budget for
the year 2009-10 with the basic objective of returning to the path of faster
and more inclusive growth, which is so essential for fulfilling all our social
and economic objectives.

In keeping with the promises made in our 2004 Manifesto, the Congress-led
UPA government had set up a number of very important commissions
including the Administrative Reforms Commission, the National Commission
on Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector, the National Farmers Commission,
the National Knowledge Commission and the National Manufacturing
Competitiveness Council. Their valuable recommendations will be taken up
for implementation in a systematic manner and without any delay.

The Work Programme: 2009-2014

In addition to consolidating and taking forward the numerous missions,
programmes and schemes launched during 2004-2009, the Indian National
Congress makes the following solemn promises to the people of our country.

¢ We will guarantee the maximum possible security to each and every
citizen.

Our policy is zero-tolerance towards terrorism from whatever source it
originates. We have already initiated the process of equipping our police and
other specialist security forces with the latest weapons and technology to
meet terrorist threats. This process will be taken forward vigourously. More
specialist battalions will be raised and positioned in key locations across the
country.

Citizenship is a right and a matter of pride. With the huge IT expertise
available in our country, it is possible to provide every Indian with a unique
identity card after the publication of the national population register in the
year 2011.

¢ We will ensure the highest level of defence preparedness and also take
further steps for the welfare of the defence forces and their families

During the BJP-led NDA government, over Rs 24,000 crores of funds meant
for defence modernisation were simply not spent. In the last five years,
modernisation of our defence forces has resumed substantially. This will

12

continue at a rapid pace. The Indian National Congress also pledges to make
India’s defence forces technology-enabled and equipped with modern
weapons, aircraft, ships and delivery systems to repel any threat from land,
sea or air.

Recognizing their special concerns, a new and separate department of ex-
servicemen’s welfare was established in 2004 by the Congress-led UPA
Government. Ex-servicemen constitute a large cadre of dedicated and
trained persons. We will utilize them extensively in crucial nation-building
tasks.

¢ We will accelerate the process of police reforms

The Indian National Congress recognizes the imperative of police reforms. A
clear distinction between the political executive and police administration
will be made. The police force will be better provisioned especially in the
matter of housing and education facilities; the police force will be made more
representative of the diversity our population; and police recruitment will be
made more effective and training professionalized to confront new and
emerging threats. Accountability of the police force will be institutionalized.

« We will build on the success of the NREGA and take the scheme
forward.

The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, first promised by the Indian
National Congress in its 2004 Lok Sabha elections manifesto, has been an
outstanding success.

While drawing on the lessons of various social audits, the Indian National
Congress now pledges at least 100 days of work at a real wage of Rs 100 a
day for everyone as an entitlement under the NREGA.

¢ Along the lines of NREGA, we will enact a National Food Security Act

The Indian National Congress pledges to enact a Right to Food law that
guarantees access to sufficient food for all people, particularly the most
vulnerable sections of society. The Indian National Congress pledges that
every family living below the poverty line either in rural or urban areas will
be entitled, by law, to 25 kgs of rice or wheat per month at Rs 3 per kg.
Subsidised community kitchens will be set up in all cities for homeless people
and migrants with the support of the Central government.

¢ We will guarantee health security for all

The National Rural Health Mission has already begun to make a noticeable
impact and will be implemented with an even greater sense of urgency. The
Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) introduced by the Congress-led UPA
Government offers health insurance for poor families. Expenditure on health

13

is a major cause of indebtedness, particularly in rural areas. The Indian
National Congress pledges that every family living below the poverty line will
be covered by the RSBY over the next three years. Every district
headquarters hospital will be upgraded to provide quality heath facilities to
all.

¢ We will ensure comprehensive social security to those at special risk

The Indian National Congress will ensure a comprehensive cover of social
security to all persons who are at special risk including (i) single-woman
headed households; (ii) disabled and the elderly; (iii) urban homeless; (iv)
released bonded workers; (v) members of primitive tribal groups; and (vi)
members of designated “most backward” dalit communities.

¢ We will be make quality education affordable to everyone

India today has one of the largest educational loan programmes in the world.
Over the past five years, over fifteen lakh students have received loans
totaling more than Rs 26,000 crores and are pursuing various professional
courses.

The Indian National Congress now pledges that all students admitted to any
recognized course in any recognized college/university will be provided, on a
need basis, either a scholarship or an educational loan without collateral
repayable over a very long period.

In order to ensure quality school education for all children, we have already
made a beginning by approving the setting up of one model school in every
block of the country. Every year, over the next five years, we will add one
more model school in every block.

The Indian National Congress pledges to focus more sharply on outcomes
and achievement levels in education and not just on enrolment. It also
pledges a major programme for training of teachers and improving the
physical environment in schools.

A massive expansion in higher education has been undertaken in the past
two years—8 new IITs, 7 new IIMs, 5 new Indian Institutes of Science
Education and Research, 30 new Central Universities, 20 new Indian
Institutes of Information Technology and 374 new colleges in educationally-
deprived districts. The Indian National Congress pledges to ensure that these
expansion plans are implemented fully with their twin focus on excellence
and affirmative action.

¢ We will implement a nation-wide skill development programme
India is a young country with 70% of the population below the age of 35. To
reap the “demographic dividend”, the Indian National Congress believes that

14

there is an urgent need to put in place an extensive skill development
programme so that the employability of youth is enhanced. The Congress-led
UPA government has already put in place a National Skills Development
Mission. Rs 30,000 crore will be invested in this mission which is of crucial
importance for the future of our youth. Funds will be provided to ensure its
widest possible coverage. A wider and more comprehensive spectrum of
skills will be imparted.

¢ We will expand schemes for improving well-being of farmers and their
families

In addition to continuing the programmes that were launched over the past
five years, the Indian National Congress pledges that every small and
marginal farmer in the country will have access to bank credit at lower rates
of interest. While the massive loan waiver scheme has already been
implemented and 3.68 crore farmer-families have benefited from it, the
Indian National Congress now pledges to extend interest relief to all farmers
who repay bank loans on schedule.

The Indian National Congress is determined to ensure that farming becomes
a profitable occupation. All measures in support of this objective will be
taken. Programmes for agricultural diversification, agri-processing and rural
industrialization will be pursued systematically. Dairying, aquaculture,
fisheries, horticulture and sericulture will receive an additional boost. The
special needs of crops like tea, coffee, rubber, spices, cashew and coconut
will be met. A renewed emphasis will be placed on wasteland development
and afforestation.

The Indian National Congress will implement comprehensive crop insurance
schemes and will also examine the feasibility of direct income support to
farmers in the ecologically vulnerable regions of the country. Minimum
Support Price (MSP) and procurement will be ensured at the doorsteps of
farmers.

All controls on the free movement of farm commodities and processing of
agricultural products and all regulations that depress incomes of farmers will
be systematically eliminated.

The Indian National Congress is firmly committed to ensuring that farmers
get, at a very minimum, market rates for the land that is acquired for
industrial projects. The Indian National Congress also believes that farmers
should be given an option to become stakeholders in such _ industrial
ventures. As a matter of priority, the National Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Bill, 2007, that could not be passed because of the
obstructionist tactics of the BJP, will be taken up for passage in the 15"" Lok
Sabha. The Land Acquisition Act, 1894 will also be amended to ensure that
the interests of land-owners are more than adequately protected.

15

* We will democratize and_ professionalize the functioning of
cooperatives

The Indian cooperative movement comprising about 5 lakh cooperatives with
more than 22 crore members is the largest such movement in the world. It
plays a crucial role in our development. The Indian National Congress has
always stood for its democratic, autonomous and professional functioning
and this will be ensured by enacting appropriate laws, including making a
Constitutional provision.

* We will give even greater impetus to the empowerment of weaker
sections of society.

The empowerment of the weaker sections of society — scheduled castes,
scheduled tribes, OBCs, minorities and women — has been an article of faith
with the Indian National Congress. This will be carried forward with emphasis
on education, particularly skill-based and professional education.

Education at all stages — primary, secondary and university — will be free in
all respects for boys and girls belonging to dalit and adivasi communities.

Coaching fees for all entrance exams for at least one lakh scheduled
caste/scheduled tribe students every year will be paid by the Central
Government. National scholarships for boys and girls belonging to scheduled
castes and scheduled tribes will be further increased.

The Indian National Congress will take steps to ensure that allocations under
the Special Component Plan for scheduled castes and the Tribal Sub-Plan for
scheduled tribes (first introduced by Indira Gandhi over three decades ago)
are made in accordance with their proportions in the population.

An unprecedented special drive was launched by the Prime Minister and over
53,000 vacancies in government have been filled through direct recruitment
or promotion of members belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled
tribes. This drive will continue.

The Indian National Congress is deeply committed to pursuing affirmative
action for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the private sector. It has
already initiated a national debate on this issue. It also pledges to carve out
a reservation for the economically weaker sections of all communities
without prejudice to existing reservations for scheduled castes, scheduled
tribes and OBCs.

For the first time, a separate Ministry of Minority Affairs was created in May
2004 and the Rajinder Sachar Committee was set up to look into the social,
economic and educational status of the Muslim community in the country.
The implementation of the recommendations of the Sachar Committee is
already under way and an Equal Opportunity Commission will be established

16

by law. Nearly four lakh scholarships have been awarded over the past two
years alone for pre-matric, post-matric and professional courses, with more
than 50% of these being awarded to girl students. The Prime Minister’s 15-
point programme was launched in June 2006 with physical and financial
targets for minorities in all welfare programmes of the Central Government.
A special development package for the 90 minority-concentration districts in
different states has been introduced.

The Indian National Congress is irrevocably committed to ensuring that the
Constitutional rights of all minorities are protected fully, that the
representation of minorities in public administration increases substantially,
and that minorities recognize that the government is working for their
welfare at all times. The Indian National Congress has pioneered reservations
for minorities in Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in government
employment and education on the basis of their social and economic
backwardness. We are committed to adopt this policy at the national level. A
Wakf Development Corporation will be established to develop wakf
properties. A National Unani University will be set up. The corpus of the
Maulana Azad Educational Foundation will be doubled.

The Indian National Congress introduced reservation for women_ in
panchayats and nagarpalikas. Today, about 40% of the elected
representatives in panchayats are women, compared to a reservation of 33%
mandated for them. This is nothing short of a quiet revolution. The Indian
National Congress will ensure that the Bill for reserving 33% of the seats in
the Lok Sabha and the State legislatures is passed in the 15"" Lok Sabha and
that the elections to the 16 Lok Sabha are held on the basis of one-third
reservation for women.

Over the next five years, the Indian National Congress will endeavour to
ensure that at least half of the country’s rural women population will be
enrolled as members of self-help groups linked with banks and that they will
get loans from banks at moderate interest rates. The Indian National
Congress also proposes to reserve one-third of all central government jobs
for women.

The Indian National Congress believes that, in addition to education,
business development programmes are needed on a larger-scale for
scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and women. Preferential policies will be
adopted in government contracts to stimulate entrepreneurial activities
amongst these groups.

Social security schemes for occupations like weavers, fishermen and
fisherwomen, toddy tappers, leather workers, plantation labour, construction
labour, mine workers and beedi workers will be expanded.

17

The Indian National Congress is deeply committed to ensuring equality of
opportunity and full participation of persons with disabilities, including the
blind, in all sectors of life. To begin with, a comprehensive review of laws and
programmes will be undertaken and the shortcomings noticed in their
implementation will be removed.

« We will combat communalism of all kinds and caste atrocities with
determination

The Indian National Congress reiterates its unflinching resolve to combat
communalism of all kinds and to deal ruthlessly with those perpetrating
atrocities on weaker sections like dalits and women. The Indian National
Congress believes in ensuring the right to compensation and rehabilitation
for all victims of communal, ethnic and caste violence on standards and
levels that are binding on every government. The Indian National Congress
will propose a law that empowers the National Human Rights Commission to
monitor investigation and trial in all cases of communal and caste violence.

The Indian National Congress will bring school curricula of various communal
and sectarian organizations — regardless of their affiliation —under the
regulatory purview of an empowered national body.

¢ We will bring a sharp focus on the special needs of children, especially
the girl child

For the first time, a National Commission for Protection of Child Rights was
established in 2006. The Commission’s mandate is to ensure that the welfare
of children as guaranteed by various laws is protected and promoted. New
laws have also been passed to prohibit child labour and child marriage. New
schemes to improve the nutritional status of children, especially girls, and to
educate them have been launched in the past five years. Over 18 lakh
anganwadi workers and helpers have benefited from an increase in their
remuneration last year.

The Indian National Congress commits itself to the universalisation of the
ICDS by March 2012 and to provide an anganwadi in every habitation and full
coverage of children up to the age of six for food, nutrition and pre-school
education. The special requirements of children of migrant workers in towns
and cities will be met through new programmes in association with civil
society organizations. A number of programmes have already been launched
to combat the still widely-prevalent phenomenon of child malnutrition and
these will be infused with an even greater sense of urgency.

The Indian National Congress will introduce special incentives for the girl
child to correct the adverse sex ratio and to ensure education of girl children.
Girl children in districts that have an adverse sex ratio and/or low enrolment
of girls, monetary incentives will be given to the girl child to be credited to

18

the girl child’s account on her completing primary school, middle school,
secondary school and higher secondary school.

¢ We will make elected panchayat institutions financially strong

Thanks entirely to the tireless efforts of Rajiv Gandhi, there are some
2,50,000 elected panchayat bodies all over the country with almost 32 lakh
elected representatives. It is through such institutions that we will ensure
inclusive governance which is essential for inclusive economic growth. The
Indian National Congress is unwavering in its commitment to full
Constitutionally-mandated devolution of funds, functions and functionaries to
the panchayats. The annual allocations to gram panchayats that can be used
for purposes designated as priority by the gram sabha will be substantially
stepped up.

The Indian National Congress will also upgrade the technical capabilities of
panchayat institutions and ensure that information technology is used
extensively to enhance their effectiveness.

¢ We will connect all villages to a broadband network in three years time

While connectivity across the country has increased manifold in recent
years, the Indian National Congress pledges to bring the fruits of the IT
revolution to more cities and towns. It also pledges to connect every village
to a broadband network within three years. This will help locate new, non-
agricultural jobs in villages and open vast new opportunities for our rural
youth. Thus the vision of Rajiv Gandhi — the use of IT for rural
transformation -- will be realized in even greater measure. Already, IT is
being used in areas like computerization of land records but we now promise
a bolder, time-bound initiative.

¢ We will give special focus to the small entrepreneur and to small and
medium enterprises

Small and medium enterprises and the self-employed are the backbone of
our industrial and service economy. They are the major generators of
productive employment for our youth. The Indian National Congress pledges
a “new deal” for SMEs and for first-generation entrepreneurs by assuring
them greater access to collateral-free credit, liberating them from the
multiplicity of laws and forms, and freeing them from the clutches of
inspectors.

The Indian National Congress pledges a targeted cluster-based approach to
the growth of SMEs. There are a very large number of such clusters already
in different areas like textiles, food processing, handlooms and handicrafts,
consumer goods, khadi, coir and other traditional industries, and
engineering. These clusters, mostly in small and medium towns, will be given

19

access to finance, technology and marketing and will be provided vastly
improved infrastructure.

¢ We will maintain the path of high growth with fiscal prudence and low
inflation

As the experience of 2004-09 demonstrates so vividly, rapid economic
growth creates opportunities for increased government expenditure in vital
areas like education, health, agriculture, social security and infrastructure.
Average growth in the first four years of the Congress-led UPA government
was 9% per year for the first time in our history. We will strive to maintain
this momentum with a relentless emphasis on growth that accelerates the
generation of productive jobs for our youth. The Indian National Congress is
also firmly committed to maintaining high growth with low inflation,
particularly in relation to prices of essential agricultural and industrial
commodities.

The Indian National Congress reiterates its commitment to the path of fiscal
responsibility so that the ability of the Centre to invest in essential social and
physical infrastructure is continuously enhanced. This will require that all
subsidies reach only the truly needy and poor sections of our society. The
Indian National Congress will continue its efforts to create and implement a
national consensus on this issue.

Both the public sector and private sector are essential for India’s continued
high growth success story. The Indian National Congress rejects the policy of
blind privatization followed by the BJP-led NDA government, but believes that
the Indian people have every right to own part of the shares of public sector
companies while the government retains majority shareholding. Public sector
enterprises in the manufacturing sector (like energy, transport and telecom)
and in the financial sector (like banks and insurance companies) will remain
in the public sector and will be given all support to grow and become
competitive.

The manufacturing industry in India has seen a revival in recent years and
this will be sustained and deepened, particularly labour-intensive
manufacturing. The emphasis in all foreign investment policies will be
maximization of local value-addition and export potential. The Indian
National Congress will ensure that the policies it has put in place for
attracting private investment for oil exploration will also be followed for other
mineral resources, including coal and iron-ore.

The Indian National Congress remains committed to ensuring the highest
standards of corporate governance in private companies, especially to
protect the interests of small shareholders and small investors. Regulations
will be made to ensure good corporate governance, ethical business
practices and accountability to all stakeholders.

20

¢ We will introduce the goods and services tax from April 1, 2010.

The Congress-led UPA government successfully implemented VAT
throughout the country. This has brought abundant revenues to all States.
The Indian National Congress now pledges to take the next decisive step and
introduce a moderate goods and services tax (GST). Once GST is
implemented, all other central and state-level indirect taxes such as VAT,
excise duty, service tax, entertainment tax, luxury tax, etc. will stand
abolished and bring substantial relief to the aam admi. GST will create a
seamless national common market for our farmers, artisans and
entrepreneurs and will boost employment. State finances, and more
importantly the finances of panchayats and nagarpalikas, will be put on a
sound foundation.

¢ We will give a completely new look to urban governance

While the bulk of our population still lives and works in villages, India is
rapidly urbanizing. But the provision of basic infrastructure in towns and
cities has not kept pace with its requirements. A massive programme of low-
cost social housing and sanitation is needed to make our urban areas more
livable. Recognizing that our towns and cities are engines of creativity and
innovation, the Indian National Congress pledges to create a new model of
urban administration with financially-viable self-government institutions as
the pivot.

¢ We will offer a new deal to our youth to participate in governance

The Indian National Congress has always been the party that has reposed its
confidence in youth. It was Rajiv Gandhi who gave all 18 year-olds the right
to vote and it was he who declared Swami Vivekananda’s birthday on
January 12"" as National Youth Day. The IT revolution that has spread in our
country has opened up whole new avenues for our youth.

The Indian National Congress will design and launch a voluntary national
youth corps which would enable young men and women in the age group of
18-23 to serve up to two years in constructive nation-building activities for
which they will be suitably compensated.

The Indian National Congress will also make a beginning to induct youth into
organs of government. As a beginning, it will reserve a proportion of seats in
panchayats and nagarpalikas for men and women below the age of 35 years
without detriment to the existing reservations for scheduled castes,
scheduled tribes, OBCs and women.

The Indian National Congress has periodically renewed itself by inducting
young men and women into the Party and entrusting them with
responsibilities. Under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, the Indian National

21

Congress has launched a unique exercise to bring youth from all sections of
society and all walks of life into the political mainstream through the Indian
Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI). For the
very first time in any political party, there are hundreds of elected youth
leaders in Punjab and Uttarakhand. This exercise is now being conducted in
Gujarat and Tamil Nadu and will soon encompass other parts of the country.
This is a practical demonstration of the deep commitment of the Indian
National Congress to open new political space and opportunities to our
youth.

¢ We will protect India’s natural environment and take steps to
rejuvenate it

The Indian National Congress has declared the sacred Ganga as a “national
river”. The Ganga River Basin Authority has been established with the Prime
Minister at its head for ensuring that development needs are met in an
ecologically sustainable manner. This Authority will be accorded the highest
priority. Water security is of paramount concern to the Indian National
Congress and steps will be taken to enhance it measurably for local
communities.

India has an enormously rich biodiversity that is under threat on account of
various reasons. The Indian National Congress commits itself to
strengthening people’s movements whose objective will be to protect and
preserve our bio-resources and ensure their sustainable use.

Climate change has now emerged as a serious challenge for the world
community. India too has begun to feel its impact in different ways. The
Congress-led UPA government has already unveiled a National Action Plan
for Climate Change. It is an acknowledgment of our responsibility to take
credible actions within the overall framework of meeting the development
aspirations of our people for higher economic growth and a higher standard
of living. This action plan will be implemented in letter and spirit.

¢ We will carry out a massive renewal of our extensive science and
technology infrastructure

One of the most outstanding legacies of Jawaharlal Nehru is the vast
infrastructure for science and technology that India possesses and which has
made so many far-reaching contributions to the country’s progress — in
agriculture, nuclear energy, defence, space, industry, energy, telecom and
IT. The Indian National Congress is firmly commited to extend full support to
the modernization and expansion of our science and technology institutions
and will ensure that they attract and retain the best talent from India and
abroad.

22

¢ We will pursue judicial reforms to cut delays in courts

Although delays in the Supreme Court have come down appreciably in recent
years, delays in High Courts and district courts are still unacceptably high.
The Indian National Congress has always been of the view that justice
delayed is justice denied and will therefore pursue judicial reforms to ensure
timely completion of the hearing and disposal of cases. As a reflection of this
priority, the Gram Nyayalaya Act, a key promise of our 2004 Manifesto, was
passed by Parliament last year. Setting up of Gram Nyayalayas at the
headquarters of the intermediate panchayats and mobile courts in the rural
areas will bring to the aam admi speedy, affordable and substantial justice.

¢ We will continue to be sensitive to regional aspirations

The Indian National Congress is aware that in some large states the
persistence of intra-regional imbalances in development has given rise to the
demand for separate states. While it has introduced several programmes to
redress these disparities, recognising the legitimacy of these concerns and
acknowledging that the solution may vary from one state to another, the
Indian National Congress will find pragmatic solutions to deal with these
demands.

¢ We will ensure energy security for our country

The last two years have seen a very sharp turnaround in the addition to
power generating capacity. This momentum will be maintained and it will be
ensured that the country adds at least 12,000-15,000 mw of capacity every
year through a mix of sources—coal, hydel, nuclear and renewables. Rural
electrification and reduction in distribution losses will be given the highest
priority. The Indian National Congress promises a very significant increase in
the share of nuclear power, both through domestic and imported technology
which has now been made possible by the civil nuclear agreements. The
pace of oil and gas exploration will be intensified. India’s oil diplomacy will be
pursued aggressively. The Indian National Congress will implement a scheme
to supply energy to poor families at affordable prices.

+ We will take further steps to preserve and promote our heritage

India has an extraordinarily rich heritage going back centuries. The Indian
National Congress will take further steps to protect, preserve and promote
this heritage and ensure that its value is fully appreciated, especially by the
younger generation’ particularly. A statutory National Heritage
Sites Commission will be made fully operational. This will be an important
instrument to strengthen the foundations of our pluralistic culture and
inheritances.

23

¢ We will continue to pursue an independent, pro-India foreign policy

The Indian National Congress has always upheld India’s supreme national
interests and has often braved criticism and opposition both at home and
abroad in defending the country’s interests. At the same time, the Indian
National Congress has always believed that it is India’s historic destiny to be
engaged and connected with the rest of the world and, in particular, with the
countries of Asia.

The foreign policy followed in the past five years has yielded handsome
results: the foremost example is the agreements on civil nuclear cooperation
signed with the USA, Russia, France and Kazakhstan.

India’s well-thought out foreign policy and its patient but forceful diplomacy
has obliged Pakistan to admit that its citizens were responsible for carrying
out the dastardly attacks in Mumbai in November 2008. The Indian National
Congress has striven for an enduring peace and for close economic relations
with Pakistan. The Indian National Congress has also encouraged extensive
people-to-people contacts between the two countries, particularly amongst
the younger generation. But the Mumbai attacks have cast a long shadow on
the on-going dialogue and engagement process. It is now entirely upto
Pakistan to break the impasse by taking credible action against those
responsible for the carnage in Mumbai. If it does so and dismantles the
terrorist networks that operate from its soil, a Congress-led government will
not be found wanting in its response.

The long-held policy of the Indian National Congress is that the Government
of Sri Lanka should find an honourable solution to the strife in that country
and ensure that all communities, especially the Tamil-speaking people, are
guaranteed and enjoy equal rights within the framework of a united Sri
Lanka. The Indian National Congress offers to help the parties reach an
agreement as envisaged in the India-Sri Lanka Peace Accord of 1987 which
remains the only basis for a politically negotiated settlement.

The Indian National Congress welcomes the return of multi-party democracy
to Bangladesh and Nepal. It will work with both countries to deepen bilateral
ties across a wide spectrum of areas for demonstrable mutual benefit. The
Indian National Congress also believes that the two countries must take note
of India’s security concerns in a more meaningful manner.

The Indian National Congress has always championed the legitimate and
peaceful aspirations of the long-suffering Palestinian people and urges that a
viable Palestinian state be established at the earliest.

India’s relationships with countries like the USA, Russia, China and Japan
and with countries of Europe have been transformed by sustained diplomatic
efforts since 2004. These relationships will be further deepened. India has
begun a whole new process of engagement with the countries of Africa

24

where there is great appreciation of what India has to offer to them. This
engagement will be expanded.

¢ The Indian National Congress will intensify the involvement of overseas
Indians in development

The Indian National Congress takes great pride, as does the entire country,
in the outstanding accomplishments of overseas Indians in different fields.
The Indian National Congress also acknowledges the vital role remittances
by overseas Indians play in bolstering the country’s finances. The Ministry of
Overseas Indian Affairs was created in May 2004 to reflect the priority that
the Indian National Congress places on maximizing the contributions of the
overseas Indian community to our country’s economic, scientific and
technological progress. A number of measures have been taken to protect
the interests of lakhs of Indian workers in the Middle East. This will continue
to be a matter of priority. New opportunities will be created for overseas
Indians to play their rightful role in the renewal of institutions of higher
learning and in starting new ventures and businesses. Four new universities
will be established with 50% of the seats reserved for PIO/NRI students.

V. An Appeal

This is the time for Back to Basics,

basics that provided the impetus to our Independence

and self-confident India over the past half century.

A time to reestablish the core values

that have made India unique.
A time to rejoice in our diversities and reiterate our unities.

A time to reestablish the rule of law

and repair our secular fabric.
A time to revive economic growth.
A time to reinforce social justice and equity.
A time to reinvigorate agriculture.
A time to recharge the aspirations of our youth and women.
A time to reinject clarity and consistency in governance.

A time to rekindle the flame of all-inclusive,

composite, pluralistic nationalism.

A time to reject the forces of bigotry and divisiveness.

A time to reinvent the politics as an instrument

The 2004 Lok Sabha elections is no ordinary election.
It is not just an election between one party and another,
It is a clash of sharply competing values,
of diametrically opposite ideologies.

It is a contest between the Congress that has always
celebrated India's glorious past and drawn from its traditions
to build modern India, and the BJP that is systematically
undermining the very essence of Indian civilization
and destroying the very idea of India.

The Congress recognises that this is not a moment for a
natrow pursuit of partisan power. This is the moment
to consolidate all forces subscribing to the fundamental

THE KEY ISSUE

values of our Constitution. The Congress's
goal is to defeat the forces of obscurantism and
bigotry who contributed nothing to the Freedom
Movement or the making of our Constitution and
whose sole objective is to subvert our millennial

 

 

heritage and composite nationhood. In this sacred

endeavour, the Congress has joined hands with

likeeminded political parties in different states.
The Congress and its various allies are

united in their determination to defeat the BJP,
which threatens to rewrite our past and

wreck our future. In the process, we will present

the national alternative to bring India back on the path

of economic growth with social harmony.

SUED

‘There are five main reasons why the Congress
remains unique among all political parties in
India.

First, the Congress is the only all-India party in
the country, the only national political force with
a presence in each and every region of this vast
country. Whether in power or out, the Congress
is a visible and tangible political force in villages,
towns and cities all across India.

Second, the Congress is the only
political party that derives its
strength and support from, and
appeals to, each and every section
of our variegated society. It is the
only political party that ha:
provided for reservations in it:
organization for scheduled castes
scheduled tribes, OBCs
minorities and women,

Third, the Congress is the only
party whose philosophy o

governance is rooted ir
democratic values, combining
sustainable economic growth with
social justice, and marrying
economic liberalization to social liberalism. The
Congress way is the way of dialogue, not discord.
The Congress way is the way of accommodation,

not acrimony.

Fourth, the Congress is the only party whose
philosophy of governance is based on a strong
centre working purposefully with strong states
and with empowered local self-government
institutions. Rajniti Se Lok Niti, Gram Sabha Se

 

 

Lok Sabha remains its objective.

Fifth, the Congress has always been a party of
youth, It respects age and seniority but yourhful
energy and dynamism has always heen its
hallmark. In 1989, it was Rajiv Gandhi who
reduced the voting age to 18. It was Rajiv Gandhi
who declared Swami Vivekananda's
birth anniversary on January [2th as National
Youth Day. It was also he who expanded

the network of Nehru Yuvak Kendras to cover all
the districts of the country.

The Congress has always been more a
broad national movement than a mere political
party in the conventional sense of the term.
For 118 years, it has provided an unusually
broad platform for people from diverse social
backgrounds to come together in the service
of the country. The Congress embodies the idea

 

ot India like no other party does.

For the Congress. Indian nationalism is all-
inclusive and cosmopolitan, a nationalism that
draws creatively from every facet of India's rich
and variegated heritage, a nationalism that is not
narrow or bigoted but celebrates the
contribution made to our composite culture by
each of the religions of the land. It is a

nationalism that has an equal and dignified place

 

WHY

 

sustained assault in the past few years. For the
Congress, secularism means full freedom and
respect for all religions. It means equal
opportunities for followers of all religions and no
discrimination on the grounds of religion. Most
of all, it means firm Opposition to communalism

of all kinds.

The misuse of any religion to spread hate and
discord in our society is communalism. The
misuse of religion to incite popular
Passions to ignite mutual
antagonisms is communalism.
Most Indians are religious. Ar the
same time, most Indians are
respectful of other faiths. Most
Indians want to live with all other
Indians, whatever their religion, in
harmony and goodwill. But a
handful of Indians have become

self-appointed guardians of their
() N ¢ RE own faiths. It is they who seek to
| ¢ — destroy social peace. It is they who

 

for everything Indian and for each and every
Indian. It is a nationalism that integrates India
emotionally. The BJP’s “cultural nationalism” isa
device for dividing Indians emotionally. The
Congress unites the Indian nation through
consensus; the BJP divides the Indian nation

through confrontation.

The Congress is deeply concerned that
secularism has come under the most severe and

want us to be prisoners of a
distorted past, invented and
misinterpreted by them to stoke

envy and jealousy and hatred
between communities.

This is the real battleground for secularism.
lr is more than a majority-minority issue. It is
actually a struggle between those who wish to
preserve the essence of all religions and those
who seek to deliberately distort that essence to
undermine our composite nationhood for
unacceptable ideological reasons and partisan
electoral ends.

grandly announced that he would come out

Till today, the nation is waiting for that expose. It isa
matter of record that most of the serious terrorist
attacks in the past threefour years have not been
investigated by the Home Ministry and
accountability fixed, while the Prime Minister and
the Deputy Prime Minister keep on

chanting their firm resolve to combat the

menace of terrorism at all costs — a

resolve thatis completely hollow.

The External Affairs Minister personally

escorted three hard-core terrorists to

safety to Kandahar in Afghanistan.

These terrorists then continued their

wanton killings of innocent men,

women and children in J&K. Recently,

the former head of Pakistan's ISI has

admitted that the terrorist escorted by

Shri Jaswant Singh to Kandahar masterminded the
attack on our Parliamenton December 13, 2001.

The BJP is going to the polls ona socalled “feel good”
factor. This is bogus. The reality is that under Shri Atal
Bihari Vajpayee, the average annual rate of economic
orowth is lower than in the 1980s and much lower
than during 1992-96 when the Congress was in
power. The rate of both public and private investment
has declined over the period that the BJP-led NDA

MONUMEN

 

Authority of India (NHAI) is unprecedented. The
truth is that the NHAI was established by the
Congress government in 1995. Most of the plans had
been finalized before the Congress demitted office.
All that the BJPled NDA government has done is
turn the national highways already built by the
Congress governments of the past, into express
highways. Moreover, the new highways being built
are not free; they can be used only after payment.
Highways built under earlier Congress regimes

 

 

 

 

     

ne 1950-90 were all free and anybody could use
them.

It was during the term of the BJP-led NDA
government that the stock market and UTI scams
took place, as detailed by the Joint Parliamentary
Committee that has fixed the eighteen months
commencing from the swearing in of the NDA
government in October 1999 as the period of the

scams. Thescams wiped out the hard-earned savings

/NDA's
TAL FAILURES

 

of crores of middle class families, senor citizens,
pensioners and widows. he epicentre ot the ear
lay in cooperative banks based in the constituencies of
the Prime Ministerand the Deputy Prime Minister.

A video film showed the BJP President and other
NDA leaders taking bribes. The Defence Minister

who resigned in the wake of this expose saying he
was cleared rejoined

 

would not return till his name
office while the enquiry was on and has been

 

boycotted by the Opposition for this gross
impropriety.

The BJP and its cohorts orchestrated the horrific

communal camage in Gujarat after the tragic events

at Godhra. The RSS is indicted in most commissions

of inquiry into communal riots. The Supreme Court

has pulled up the Gujarat government repeatedly for

its complicity in the communal camage of 2001. On
this count alone, the people of India must
reject the BJP.

The BJP has fostered corruption to an
unprecedented degree with scams after
scams being revealed. On this count too,
the people of India must reject the BJP

The BJP’s economic policies have
the poor, between the fortumate few and
the disadvantaged many, between
the country. On this count also, the people of India must
rejectthe BJP

 

The BJP is using the NDA as a mask. Hiding behind
the facade of the NDA, the BJP is misleading the
people of our country. It has not given up its divisive
agenda. This is one more count on which the people of
India must reject the BJP. | val 7

 

C hange with Continuity

Congress policies have always been anchored ina
vision of an economically prosperous, socially
just, politically united and culturally harmonious
India. These policies have never been reduced by
rote to a mindless doctrine or empty dogma or
simplistic mantra. The Congress has always
created space for change. It has always been
pragmatic. It has always been ready to respond
to new challenges. In consequence, steadfastness
to basic principles has never impeded
responsiveness to new requirements.

The 1950s needed land reforms, community
development, the public sector and the building
of agricultural, industrial, irrigation,
educational, scientific and other infrastructure.

The Congress ensured that this happened.

The 1960s and 1970s needed a direct attack on
poverty, a whole new approach to agricultural
erowth and rural employment, the exploration
and exploitation of domestic sources of oil, and
the nationalization of banks to meet the
requirements of not just big business houses but
also give priority to farmers, weavers, cottage
‘ndustries and small industries and traders, as
also to fulfill social needs and aspirations. The
Congress ensured that all this happened.

The 1980s needed renewed emphasis on science
and technology to solve the problems of the
people, and the modernization of industry to
ready India to meet the new challenges of the 21st
century. It also required India to be ushered

into the computers and

electronics,
telecommunications age in a significant way. [he

Congress ensured that this happened.

THE CONG
PRIORITI.

AND PRO

The 1990s needed bolder economic reforms and
liberalization and a much larger role for the

 

private sector to accelerate growth and promote
India's integration into a rapidly-changing world
economic system. A redefinition of the role of
government in economic development,
including Constitutionally-sanctioned
Panchayati Raj Institutions and municipalities to

 

 

function as units of local self-government was also
needed. The Congress ensured that this
happened.

The Congress makes a solemn commitment to
the people of India: to restore peace among all of
its peoples, to strengthen the secular order
through emphasis on social harmony, cultural

pluralism and respect for the rule of law, and to

THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THERE

Six Basics
The Congress's six basics for governance:

¢ Samajik Sadbhavna, to ensure social cohesion
and harmony by taking the strictest possible
action against those who promote bigotry and

hatred;

Yuva Rozgar, to accelerate growth of
productive and secure employment opportunities
increase by around one crore a year and ensure
that each family has at least one job;

¢ Grameen Vikas, to improve the income and welfare
of kisans and khet mazdoors across the country;

e Arthik Navotthan to unleash the creative
energies of our professionals and entrepreneurs,
the cutting edge of our middle class;

¢ Mahila Sashaktikaran, to provide for the
political empowerment and full educational,
economic and legal equality for women;

e Saman_ Avsar, to provide for equality of
Opportunity in every way for dalits, adivasis,
OBCs and religious and linguistic minorities.

These six priorities constitute the foundation of
all policies of the Congress.

 

 

The Congress has consistently maintained that
liberalisation and globalisation can be
meaningful only if they are aimed at locallevel
economic and social transformation that directly
benefits the poor in rural and urban India,
bringing prosperity to the 6 lakh-odd villages of

India and improving the living conditions of the
urban poor.

The Congress will broaden and deepen
economic reforms. The overriding objective will
be to attain and sustain year after year a 810%
rate of economic growth and to spread this
growth over all sectors, particularly agriculture
and industry. An annual growth rate of less than
44.5% in agriculture and 10% in industry is
simply unacceptable.

Rozgar

The priority requirement for accelerated
employment generation is to revive economic
growth and sustain it across the country at
between 8-10% per year for well over a decade.
This will be the Congress's overall objective.
Faster and broad-based economic growth is an
essential pre-requisite for accelerating
employment generation. The Congress will also
adopt policies to expand employment in the
organized sector, which has fallen precipitously

in the last five years. Fiscal incentives to promote
yment-intensive growth will be introduced.

emplo
Continued growth in agriculture will create new

employment opportunities. This is particularly
so in the central, eastern and northeastern

regions of the country which have still to realize
their full agricultural potential. New jobs will also

THE CONG

AND PRO

be created in other areas of rural development

 

 

like horticulture, aquaculture, afforestation,
dairying and agro-processing. These need and
will be provided new investment, credit,
marketing and technology inputs. A stable long-
term export policy for agricultural products and
commodities will be announced.

 

 

 

The Congress will revamp the functioning of the
Khadi and Village Industries Commission
(KVIC) so as to make ita modern, research-based,

technology-driven, customer-focussed
organization.

New programmes for the
modernization of the coir industry, handlooms,
powerlooms, handicrafts, food processing,

sericulture, wool development, leather, pottery,

etc., will be launched.

A national Employment Guarantee Act will be
enacted immediately. This will provide a legal
guarantee for at least 100 days of employment on

asset-creating public works programmes every

year at minimum wage, for every rural household.

A greater thrust on labourintensive exports of

textiles, handicrafts, gems and jewelry, leather,
software, engineering and consumer goods will
also significantly boost employment. The textile
industry will receive special focus in view of the
increased competition in world markets from

January 2005 as mandated by the WTO.

The concerns of small-scale industry like shortage
of working capital, lack of technology and
marketing, delayed payments, harassment by
inspectors will be addressed expeditiously. A
cluster approach to the development of small
scale industry will be adopted.

Along with vastly expanded credit facilities for
sel-employment, the services industry will be
given all support to fulfill its true employment
potential. This includes not just software and
IT-enabled services, not just trade, distribution
and transport, not just financial and
telecommunications services but also tourism.
Special infrastructural facilities for substantially
expanding international and domestic tourism
will be created. Reforms of laws and regulations
that stand in the way of growth of the services
industry will be undertaken.

The Congress will also establish a National
Commission to monitor the functioning of
enterprises in the informal sector, the problems

 

 

they face in access to technology, credit and
markets and recommend corrective measures on
an on-going basis.

To enhance the employability of our youth,
systematic efforts will be made to vocationalise
secondary education and to establish at least one
industrial training institute in each development
block of the country through creative public
private partnerships. The employment exchange
machinery will be revamped to provide a closer
linkage between demand and supply for labour.

As an indicator of how seriously the Congress
takes its commitment to employment growth, an
annual Rozgar Report to the Nation will be
prepared and released on May 1.

Kisans and Khet Mazdoors

The Congress will pursue an Agriculture First
strategy in resource allocation. Public investment
in agriculture will be stepped up substantially
with focus in the backward and poor regions.
This will cover irrigation, electrification,
godowns, marketing, research and extension.

The entire rural credit system based on
cooperatives will be restored to health. The flow
of agricultural credit would be doubled in the
next three years and the coverage of small and
marginal farmers by institutional lending will

also expand substantially. Immediate steps will be
raken to ease the burden of debt and high interest

rates on farm loans.

A time bound programme for restoring all public
tubewells to good working condition wherever
required will be started. The pace of construction
of new irrigation wells in the poorer districts of

A special technology and extension programme

emphasis will be placed on wasteland

development and afforestation.

 

While the terms of trade will always be
maintaimed im favour of agriculture,
simultaneously steps will be taken to ensure that
profitability in agriculture Is also increased.

 

 

Earmers all over the country will receive fair and
remunerative prices and government agencies
entrusted with the responsibility for procurement
and marketing will pay special attention to

farmers in poor and backward states a nd districts.

While farm insurance schemes for both crops and
cattle will be implemented, the Congress will also
examine the feasibility of an Agricultural
Stabilisation Fund involving a system of direct
support or income support to farmers particularly
in the ecologically vulnerable regions of the
country.

Controls on the free movement of farm
commodities and processing of — agricultural
products and regulations that depress the
incomes of farmers will be systematically
removed. Farmers will be given greater say in the
organizations that supply inputs to them.

The Congress will ensure the fullest
implementation of minimum wage laws for farm
labour. Comprehensive protective legislation will
be enacted for all agricultural workers. It will
redouble its efforts to distribute surplus
productive land to the landless. It will also
modernize the revenue administration at the local
level and start a major national programme to
record all titles to land and keep them up-to-date.

Like it did tor panchayats, the Congress will bring

Women and Children

The Congress pledges to press for the
Constitutional Amendment to reserve one-third

ot seats in the Lok Sabha and in Vidhan Sabhas

tor women.

It will launch a movement for the effective
implementation of social legislation such as for
minimum age at marriage, anti-dowry, curbing
atrocities on women, anti-sati, widow welfare, etc.
as well as for minimum wages for enhancing
ssomen's welfare. Stern measures will be taken to
ensure the elimination of female foeticide and
-nfanticide. Marriage registration will be made

mandatory.

30% of all funds flowing into panchayats and
nagarpalikas will be earmarked for programmes
relating to the development of women and
children and focus on the special needs of female
agricultural labour and women cultivators.
Village women and their associations will be
empowered to assume responsibility for all
development schemes relating to drinking water

supply, sanitation, primary education and

especially for tribal women, women belonging to

 
 

 

scheduled castes, women below

the poverty line,
rural women and women in distress, and
particularly in the backward and ecologically
sensitive regions and _ actively encourage the
functioning of producer and marketing

Some states of India, particularly in the South, have

other states will do so over this decade. But on

present reckoning, fourfive states of India will be
unable to reach this crucial milestone for decades.
The Congress will take the lead in replicating the
‘uccess of other states in those states where

must become a movement of civil society as well. A
sharply targeted mobilization effort will be
mounted in the 15Q-odd districts that still have
unacceptably high levels of fertility.

Education and Health

The Congress pledges to raise public spending in
education to at least 6% of GDP with at least half
of this amount being spent in primary and
secondary schools. A cess will be proposed on all
central taxes to finance the commitment to
universalize access to quality basic education. A
National Commission on Education will be set up
to allocate resources and monitor programmes for
compliance with national priorities.

The Congress will ensure that all institutions of
higher learning in science, technology, social
sciences and management will retain the sense of
autonomy that they have enjoyed in previous
Congress regimes. Academic excellence and
professional competence would be the sole criteria
for all appointments to bodies like the ICHR,
ICSSR, UGC, NCERT, ete.

The Congress will ensure that nobody is denied
education, including in institutions of excellence,
because he or she is poor. Apart from increasing
the supply of loan scholarships and refinance
through banks, it will also establish a Education

of HDFC to provide loans at affordable rates to
all those who cannot afford the costs of college
and university education in science, engineering
and medicine. Education at all stages would be
free in all respects for boys and girls belonging to
dalit and adivasi communities.

A national cooked nutritious mid-day meal
scheme will be introduced in primary and
secondary schools across the country. The
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
will be universalized to provide for a functional
anganwadi in every settlement and full coverage,
especially children below age of six.

The Congress will raise public spending on
health to at least 2-3% of GDP, with the focus on
primary health care over the next five years and to
around 5% of GDP over the next decade.

Some state governments administered by the
Congress have introduced innovative health
‘insurance programmes. A national scheme of
health insurance for families living below the
poverty line will be proposed.

The Congress will introduce a new community-
anchored health worker scheme and implement
it with the involvement of people's organizations
and panchayati raj institutions.

Minorities

The Congress believes in affirmative action forall
religious and linguistic minorities. The Congress
has provided for reservations for Muslims in
Kerala and Karnataka in government
employment and education on the grounds that
they are a socially and educationally backward

class. The Congress 1s committed to adopting

THE CO

this policy for socially and educationally
backward sections among Muslims and other
religious minorities on a national scale. The
Congress also pledges to extend reservations for
the economically deprived persons belonging to
communities that are at present not entitled to
such reservations.

 

 

 

 

 

The Congress will adopt all possible measures
to promote and maintain communal peace
and harmony, especially in sensitive areas.
It will enact a comprehensive law on social
violence in all its forms and manifestations,
providing for investigations by a central
agency, prosecution by Special Courts and
payment of uniform compensation for loss of life,

honour and property.

The Congress commits itself to amending the
Constitution to establish a Commission for
Minority Educational Institutions that will

provide direct affiliation for minority professional
sities. Special steps

dern and technical

institutions to central univer
will be taken to spread mo

education among women in minority
communities particularly.

New middlelevel technical institutions will be
started in places where for example, weavers and
artisans are concentrated. The National
Minorities Development Corporation and State
Minorities Development Corporations will be
made directlending institutions.

On the Ayodhya issue, the Congress's stand has
been very clear. All parties must wait for and abide
by the verdict of the courts. If negotiations are to
be held, they must be between the parties to the
dispute. And the Places of Worship (Special
Provision) Act, 1992 which freezes the status of all
disputed sites other than Ayodhya as of August 15,
1947 must be strictly enforced.

Dalits and Adivasis

The Congress will create a national consensus on
the issue of dalits and adivasis getting a reasonable
share of jobs in the private sector. A dialogue with
private industry will be initiated to identify how
best Indian industry could fulfill in tangible
measure the aspirations of youth, especially those
belonging to the weaker sections of society.

Determined efforts will be made to promote a
culture of entrepreneurship among the dalits and
adivasis by providing businesses run by them with

 

 

 

preferential

treatment in government

procurement and by extending bank credit at
attordable terms.

State governments will be urged to make
legislation for conferring ownership rights in
respect of minor forest produce on adivasis
particularly who work in forests.

All reservation quotas, including those relating
to promotions will be fulfilled in a time-bound
manner. Special recruitment drives particularly
for Class I and II vacancies will be launched.

A comprehensive national programme for minor
irrigation of all lands owned by dalits and adivasis
will be introduced. Landless families will be
endowed with some land through the proper
implementation of land ceiling and land
redistribution legislation.

There is need to reconcile the objectives of faster
economic growth and environmental
conservation as far as tribal communities
dependent on forests are concerned. The Forest
Conservation Act, 1980 has prevented a
wholesale loss of forests. At the same time,
concerns have been raised that in its
implementation rigidities have developed
depriving tribal communities the benefits of

economic growth. These concerns have to be

recognized and addressed in an ecologically
sustainable manner. In addition, there is need to
put in place more effective systems of relief and
rehabilitation for tribal communities displaced

by development projects.

Taking note of the growing unrest in tribal areas
in various states, the Congress will have a fresh

look at development strategies for tribal areas and
work out new designs of sustainable livelihoods.
Income accruing to the government from forest
will be earmarked as additional assistance for
programmes of tribal development.

Food and Nutrition Security

Over the past few years, there has been far too

 

 

 

 

 

 

much tampering with the public distribution
system (PDS) that provides the basis for extending
food security to crores of Indians. Because people
are buying less foodgrain from ration shops, huge
foodgrain stocks have been built up. The
Congress will strengthen the PDS particularly in
the poorest and backward blocks of the country

and also involve women's and exservicemen's

RESS PARTY S
ES, PLANS

GRAMMES

cooperatives in its management at the local level.
While the focus of the PDS will be on below-the-
poverty line (BPL) families, surveys to identify
such families will be conducted every two years by

panchayats based on transparent and verifiable
criteria such as land ownership, occupation,

tamily status, etc.

About 68% of our population comprising the
most destitute and infirm do not have access to
the PDS even where the PDS works well. Special
schemes to reach foodgrains to this section
through panchayats will be launched. Antyodaya
cards for all households at risk of hunger will be
introduced. Grain banks in chronically food-

scarce areas will be established.

It is a matter of great shame that even today over a
third of babies born in India are underweight
reflecting acute malnourishment of the girl child
who later becomes a mother. Nutrition
programmes for the girl child particularly will be
expanded ona significant scale.

Panchayati Raj

Panchayat bodies that got Constitutional
sanction a decade ago because of the vision and
relentless zeal of Rajiv Gandhi, now need full
devolution of funds, functions and functionaries.
Globalisation and economic reforms must be
based on strong, effective and empowered
institutions of local selfgovernment.

The Congress will ensure that all funds for
poverty alleviation and rural development
programmes will be credited directly to panchayat
bodies. The Gram Sabha will be empowered to
emerge as the foundation of the panchayati raj

 

 

 

 

system. Appropriate audit systems would be
established to ensure sound financial
administration at the local level.

Informal and Unorganised Sector

Almost 93% of the workforce in our country is in
the unorganized sector. While every initiative
must and will be taken to expand the proportion
of employment in the organized sector, the
Congress will ensure the well-being and welfare of
all workers in the unorganized sector. Some
Congress state governments have already taken
significant steps in this area but a renewed
national effort is now needed with focus on social
‘nsurance and health support. Special social
security schemes started by earlier Congress
governments for workers in the unorganized
sector like weavers, handloom workers,
fchermen and fisherwomen, toddy tappers,
leather workers, plantation labour, beedi
workers, etc., will be expanded.

The Congress will establish a National
Commission to examine problems facing
enterprises Operating in the unorganized sector.
The Commission will be asked to make
appropriate recommendations to provide
technical, marketing and credit support to these
enterprises. A National Fund will be created for

purpose. A single, simplified law will be
ted to set out the obligations of these
rises to labour and for safety. Appropriate
urity measures will be devised to protect

all such informal sector service activities that
enrich urban life, so that they are spared the risk

of extortion, eviction, confiscation and
harassment.

Social and Physical Infrastructure

Public-private partnerships will form te basis of

 

 

nfrastructure expansion. Among other things,

ehis could take the form of public expenditure
and private management. Subsidies in the
provision of infrastructure will be made explicit
and provided through the budget of the central

and state governments.

The railways have suffered immensely over the

past few years with rail safety being a prime
casualty. The Congress will move purposefully to
modernize the vast railway network, keeping both
the economic and social dimensions of the

railways in mind.

The Congress will vastly accelerate the
velopment and use of the country's irrigation

 

potential. By 2020, the presently known
irrigation potential must be harnessed, for which
longterm commitments of funds will be made.
But even after this, two-fifths of cultivated area
will still be rain-fed, particularly in central India
with the bulk of India's tribal population. The
Congress and its partners will prepare and
implement, on a much larger scale, plans for these

regions.

The Congress will launch a special programme
so as to ensure each household will have
full access to reliable power in the next three
to five years. The Congress will use India's
foreign exchange reserves creatively to
significantly expand the existing public
investment programme in power generation so as
to add at least 6000-8000 MW of generating
capacity every year. The public sector has a crucial
role to play in power generation even as the
private sector takes on an increased role in power

distribution.

In order to supplement water availability
and recharge the country's groundwater
resources, a local community-based
National Rainwater Harvesting Programme
will be launched to capture at least an additional

1% of India's rain resources every yeat.

 

 

The Congress commits itself to work out a
comprehensive programme of urban renewal
based on public-private partnerships. This will lay

particular emphasis on the modernization of

urban transport, water supply and sanitation and
control of pollution. Municipal administration
will be revived and made financially self
sustaining.

Social housing schemes will be launched to meet
the needs of the urban poor and to deal with the
proliferation of slums. Technologies to promote
low-cost housing will be deployed on a large scale.

Defence, National Security and Foreign Policy

The Congress will ensure that all delays in the
modernization of our armed forces are

eliminated and that funds budgeted for
modernization are, in fact, spent to the fullest.
The Congress is committed to maintaining a
credible nuclear weapons programme while at the
same time it will evolve demonstrable and
verifiable confidence-building measures with its
nuclear neighbours. The welfare of ex-servicemen
will occupy urgent attention and plans will be
expeditiously prepared for involving them in
crucial nation-building tasks. A new Department
of Ex-Servicemen's Welfare will be set up in the

Ministry of Defence. The long-pending issue of

onerank, one-pension will once again be re

examined and the satisfactory lution arrived at
expeditiously.

Regional Development

As always, the Congress will work for balanced
regional development. India's northeast
demands and will receive special treatment with
particular emphasis on roads, power, tourism,
communication and handicrafts. Without the
restoration of law and order and a firm approach
to combating militancy, no development can be
sustained in the northeast. The northeast will
emerge as a gateway to East Asia with which India
is building new economic relationships. The
Congress also takes note of growing inter-state
disparities that have led to some important states
like UP and Bihar to fall behind in social
development and economic growth. While state
governments have the final responsibility for
governance, the central government has still an
important role in ensuring that the lagging states
improve their performance through fiscal and
other policies.

In view of the importance of state-level reforms,
the Congress will set up a Systems Reforms
Commission to work out, in cooperation with
state governments, the details of state-level
reforms that are needed to accelerate growth and

 

improve the quality of basic social services. A
structured and transparent approach to alleviate
the burden of debt on states so as to enable them
to increase social sector investments will be
adopted.

Administrative, Police, Judicial and Electoral
Reforms

An Administrative Reforms Commission will be
established to prepare a detailed blueprint for
revamping the public administration system
completely so as to make it more performance-
oriented and accountable. While basic
governance is the priority, egovernance will be
promoted on a massive scale in areas of concern
to the common man particularly, like land
records, tax administration, etc.

All government agencies but particularly those
that deal with citizens on a day-to-day basis must
operate in a responsive and accountable manner.
The Right to Information Act at the centre will be

of the Act will be made more participatory and

ensure maximum transparency. The report of
that committee is in the public domain and the
Congress is on the path of its implementation. It

was the only party to welcome last year's Supreme
Court order on disclosure by candidates that was

opposed by the BJP and it allies.

The Congress will tackle the root causes of
corruption and the generation of black money.
To a large extent, deregulation, removal of laws
that have outlived their utility or have not

 

fulfilled their social purpose, transparency in
party financing and state funding of elections will
help. Even so, the Congress is conscious of the
havoc that corruption at all levels adds to the
harassment of the common man and _ is
determined to rid the country of this scourge.

Industry

Revival of industrial growth is of paramount
importance. Incentives for boosting private
investment will be introduced. The system of
approvals of foreign direct investment will be
made more transparent. Indian industry will be
encouraged in every manner to enhance its
global presence. Competition, both domestic
and external, will be deepened across industry
with professionally-run regulatory institutions
in place to ensure that the competition is free
and fair. These regulatory institutions will
protect the interests of consumers.

The Congress will strengthen the public
sector in key, strategic areas, including
‘nfrastructure. It will help public sector
companies in these areas to emerge as global
companies. There is still an important role
for the public sector as a venture capitalist in
new and emerging areas. Public sector

 

 

 

 

companies that can be revived through new
management will be identified. The great
advantage of the public sector still lies in
Starting new projects, while the great
advantage of the private sector lies in
running them commercially. Public-private
synergies will be fostered.

The Congress will approach privatization
selectively. Disinvestment will not be
resorted to merely to raise revenue to meet
short-term targets, as the NDA has been
doing. Disinvestment revenues will be used
for designated social development
programmes. The Congress will ensure that
disinvestment increases competition and
consumer welfare.

The Congress will establish a National
Manufacturing Competitiveness Council
to provide a continuing forum for policy

the growth of the manufacturing industry
like food processing, textiles, engineering,

for investments in social and physical
infrastructure. A detailed roadmap for
accomplishing this will be unveiled within
0 days of coming to power so that a
National consensus is also created.

The Congress will undertake major

tax reforms to significantly expand
the base of taxpayers, to substantially
increase tax compliance and to make the
tax administration more citizen-friendly.
Without increasing tax rates, the
Congress believes that the present
Tax:GDP ratio of 14-15% must be
raised to at least 18% by the end of
the decade. VAT will be introduced in
close cooperation and consultation with
trade and industry. This will enhance
the competitiveness of Indian industry

and also check tax evasion.
