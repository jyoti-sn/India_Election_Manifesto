There were\nserious doubts in the minds of many about India's ability to fulfill the dreams and aspirations of her citizens.\n\nBut, if challenges were enormous, so was our resolve to build a stronger, safer and prosperous nation.\nPowered and inspired by the strengths and skills of 130 crore Indians, we converted obstacles into\nopportunities, decay into development and pessimism into positivity.\n\nAt an unimaginable speed and scale, what seemed impossible earlier soon became a reality. In the last five\nfive years, every Indian family got a bank account due to Jan Dhan Yojana, 50 crore Indians got health\ninsurance thanks to Ayushman Bharat and more than 40 crore people in the unorganised sector can now\navail pension coverage. A subject like cleanliness ignited the imagination of the nation and now we are close\nto 99% sanitation coverage, compared toa mere 38% in 2014. It is now possible for youngsters from smaller\ntowns to become entrepreneurs thanks to Mudra Yojana. The rising neo-middle and middle class with\ntaxable income upto Rs. 5 lakhs nolonger need to pay income tax.\n\nOur Government filled the infrastructure gaps with speed and foresight. The pace of construction of roads\nand railway lines has doubled. India has now more efficient ports. 18,000 villages living in darkness till 2014\nare now brightly lit thanks to rural electrification efforts. More than 2.6 crore homes have been electrified\nthrough Saubhagya Yojana. Over 1.5 crore homes built over the last five years have enabled millions to\ndream big.\n\nThe nation is no longer helpless against the barbaric forces of terror. Any destructive ideology that destroys\nthe atmosphere of peace and unity is and will be given a befitting reply. They are being paid back in their own\ncoin, with compoundinterest.\n\nIndia's Northeast, which earlier made headlines for blockage and neglect, is now witnessing\nunprecedented development. The Northeast is now closer to the national mainstream in more ways than\none.\n\n \n\f\n \n\nThe Central Government has waged a determined crusade against the scourge of corruption and black\nmoney. The culture of middlemen roaming in the corridors of power is now history. Decisions are guided by\npublic interest of all Indians and not the self-interest of a select few. The trinity of Jan Dhan- Aadhaar and\nMobile has weeded out over 8 crore fake beneficiaries, and prevented leakages of more than Rs. 1 lakh\ncrore. Systems have been strengthened to prevent money laundering. The corrupt have begun to realize\nthat their machinations will no longer be tolerated.\n\nOne can clearly see how development has become amass movement. Numerous people friendly decisions\nhave led to the empowerment of 130 crore Indians and the safeguarding of our strategic interests.\n\nToday, India stands tall at the international level. The world recognizes India's immense potential, which is\nclearly reflected in a record rise in foreign investment. India's stand on subjects like terrorism, climate\nchange and prevention of money laundering are setting the global narrative.\n\nFriends,\n\nThrough this Sankalp Patra, you would get a glimpse of the challenges of the yesteryears, the indomitable\nefforts made by 130 crore Indians to overcome those challenges and our collective vision for the future.\n\nWe have achieved a lot in the last five years and we want to do lot more. There are two commitments that |\nam extremely passionate about- doubling of farmer income and housing for all, by the year 2022. With your\nsupport, lam sure both will happen.\n\n| thank lakhs of alert, committed and patriotic citizens of India, who have enriched the Sankalp Patra with\ntheir valuable inputs. This Sankalp Patra is the voice of the people in the truest sense.\n\nYour vote in 2014 for a strong and decisive government enabled us to fill some of the biggest shortcomings\nof five decades of dynastic rule in a short span of just five years. Now that these shortcomings have been\nsuccessfully addressed, imagine the pace at which we can workin the times to come.\n\nThe next five years are crucial because in 2022, we mark the 75th anniversary of our Independence.\nGenerations of great women and men laid down their lives so that we could breathe the air of freedom. It is\nour sacred duty to create the India of their dreams.\n\nIn 2047, our nation would complete a hundred years of freedom. Let us together imagine what is the kind of\nIndia that we want by 2047. The BJP pledges to make the next five years as the foundation laying period for\nIndia of 2047. Let us together lay the foundations of this vision now, and work earnestly towards translating\nthis vision into a golden reality.\n\nHaving seen the work of different political parties and ideologies, the people of India are convinced that if\nthere is one party that can address their problems, it is the BUP. The Mantra of \u2018Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' has\nresonated across the length and breadth of India. BJP is a party for every Indian. It is a Party that works 24/7\nat the grassroots level. That is why, the support we have received has been historic and unprecedented\nNew India has broken from the shackles of the past. Today, we are a nation that is daring to dream and\ndreaming to dare. There is an air of hope anda spirit of aspiration among the youth.\n\nTogether, let us work towards building a strong and inclusive India, whose citizens are assured of dignity,\nprosperity, security and opportunity.\n\nVande Mataram! \u2018]\nov <p mee,\n\nNarendra Modi\n\n \n\f\n \n\nBharatiya Janata Party is committed to Indian values, to making Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan) a reality and to\nre-establishing the ideals of nation building. Our promises originate from our five commitments (Panch-\nNishtha). We have an ideology that inspires us to fulfil our promises, which are not just limited to elections\nand election manifestos. Inclusive development, good governance, national security, promotion of our\ncultural heritage at a global level and continuance of a multi-dimensional progress are the salient features\nof our ideology that continues to be a part of our promises and commitments to the nation. None of the\nvision documents or manifestos of the Bharatiya Janata Party are either temporary or amere pile of papers.\nEvery single word written in our manifesto signifies our commitment to the nation and its people.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party has been active in public sphere for decades guided by the ideological foundation\nlaid down by Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee and carried forward by Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya through his\nmission of Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan). Whenever our party has received the mandate of the Indian people to\ngovern the country, we have served the people and fulfilled their wishes with full sincerity and commitment.\nUnder Atalji\u2019s leadership, when the BUP-led NDA government won the mandate to govern the country, our\nparty ensured that the benefits of development and good governance reach the last citizen at the bottom\nof the societal ladder. Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan) remains Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s path, its resolve and goal.\n\nToday, when we are ushering in the biggest festival of democracy - the General Elections of 2019, | would\nlike to dwell on the resolves made by the BJP. In 2014, when the BJP presented its Vision Document before\nthe people, India\u2019s march of development had already been derailed because of the UPA government's\ninaction and policy paralysis. It was a phase when the hope of seeing a corruption free and transparent\ngovernment realised seemed impossible. Nobody was ready to believe that multi-dimensional\ndevelopmental goals could be achieved without resorting to corruption. However, the government led by\nPrime Minister Shri Narendra Modi turned this belief into a reality by successfully running the government in\na transparent manner. We have succeeded in conveying this message to the people at large that\ngovernance is possible without corruption.\n\nIn 2014, Shri Narendra Modi emerged as the symbol of the aspirations of the people of India and we made\nsome promises. Today, when we are at this juncture of elections and facing the electorate, | can assert with\nimmense pride and satisfaction that the journey of resolves and commitments that began in 2014 will\ncontinue to be carried forward in accordance with the wishes of the people. We have succeeded in kindling\nfaith towards development in the minds of people and have convinced them that the Narendra Modi led\nBJP government is the harbinger of a New India. The same people who used to once say, \u201cNothing can\nhappen in this country\u201d, are now hopeful and say, \u201cWe can do more\u201d while standing united for the\ndevelopment of India.\n\nIt has been seen in the past that even if a government continues to govern the country for a period of twenty\nyears, it succeeds in taking one or two historic decisions. In its tenure of five years, the government led by\nPrime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been able to take many decisions which are historic and has ushered\nin a comprehensive and fundamental transformation. Swachh Bharat Mission, Ujjawala Yojana, Saubhagya\nYojana, Demonetisation, GST, Surgical Strikes, Air Strikes, total electrification, provision for housing for 2.5\ncrore families, health insurance under Ayushman Bharat for more than 50 crore people and disbursement\n\n \n\f\n \n\n\u00bb\n\nof loans to more than 14 crore people under MUDRA Yojana are some of the historic achievements of our\ngovernment. The Congress led UPA government could never have dreamt of achieving, let alone envisaging\nsuch watershed policy initiatives. The idea of fulfilling the basic necessities of every ordinary citizen is\nintrinsic to our party\u2019s ideology.\n\nIn last five years our government has done incredible work in establishing a transparent system of\ngovernance, furthering economic development and increasing people\u2019s participation in the country\u2019s\nprogress. Today, India is the sixth largest economy in the world and from the point of view of ease of doing\nbusiness we have emerged as one of the best destinations in the world. India\u2019s prestige on the global stage\nis at an all-time high since Independence. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, we\nhave been able to make an India that our friends praise, our competitors respect and our enemies fear. India\nis now ina position to adopt an independent stand on national security, to successfully strive to strengthen\nour Armed Forces and to lead the world in various spheres. In the field of space too, India has emerged asa\nglobal power.\n\nIndia has been able to convey to the global community the unequivocal message that it considers terrorism\nas a serious threat to the world and stands in solidarity for concerted action against the menace of\nterrorism. We have also been able to convey that India will instantly give a befitting reply to any act of terror\nthat is perpetrated against us. The world, today, sees us as a strong and emerging power. Not only have we\nsucceeded in strengthening our Armed Forces with state-of-the-art defence technologies, but also\nbecome self-reliant in this field.\n\nThe General Election of 2019 is an election for carrying forward the multi-dimensional journey of\ndevelopment started by the Narendra Modi led government. This election is significant because it narrates\nthe story of a country that has faced historical wrongs before this government came to power in 2014. Itisa\ngovernment which has, since then, demonstrated that in the race of development it is not going to stop or\nslow down. Inthe journey of aspirations and trust, itis an election to select a government which has one aim\nand objective and thatis to continue with the journey of development, good governance and prosperity.\n\nThis election is not between two political parties; rather, it is an election to dissipate the negativity that\nmakes us oblivious of our glorious past and our cultural roots and values. This election is not about victory or\ndefeat; rather it is an election to reject those opportunists who trample upon the hopes of the common\npeople for their personal gains. This election is to defeat dynasticism, casteism, communalism and\ncorruption so that India\u2019s democracy can be infused with greater strength.\n\nIn order to ascertain the future of India\u2019s march of development, we have incorporated in our Sankalp the\nhopes, aspirations, opinions and suggestions of crores of our fellow citizens. This Vision Document is the\nrepresentative document of the expectations of the people of India, it gives voice to their aspirations. To\nensure that the Vision Document of a government that bases itself on people's participation and support,\nalso reflects their hopes and aspirations, the Manifesto Committee led by Shri Rajnath Singhji had\nundertaken a marathon effort. This effort is now before you in the form of the Sankalp Patra. Each member\nof the committee and every person associated with the formulation of this document deserves\nappreciation.\n\nFriends, this election is not merely to elect a government, it is an election to ensure the country\u2019s national\nsecurity, it is an election to propel India to become among the top five economic powers, it is an election to\ntransform the lives of 50 crore poor Indians, it is an election to take the country forward and to make India\ngreat in the comity of nations.\n\nCome, let us strengthen Shri Narendra Modi\u2019s hands, and resolve to form a full majority BJP government.\nWith Best Wishes\nws \\_-\n.\n\nAmit Shah\nNational President, BJP\n\n \n\f\n \n\nIt gives me immense pride and satisfaction to present to you the Bharatiya Janata Party's vision document,\nwhich is a collection of the hopes and aspirations of every Indian. This document is a compendium of our\npromises and commitments that we make to our fellow citizens who stand with us on the journey of\ndevelopment which India has undertaken since 2014. We have prepared this document after an elaborate\nand extensive discussion with people from different regions, communities and classes across the country\nthrough \u2018Bharat Ke Mann Ki Baat\u2019, the largest ever collaborative effort to engage citizens in crafting the\nroadmap of development for the next five years. These direct suggestions from all across the country form\nthe core of our vision document for the 2019 elections. The promises that we have made in it are our\ncommitments to facilitate building a New India.\n\nIndia has moved on the path of progress at an unprecedented pace after Prime Minister Shri Narendra\nModi-led NDA government won a decisive mandate to form the government and serve the people of India.\nWeare bringing to you this document at a time when our country has already embarked on the path of rapid\nprogress under this government. It is as a result of Shri Modi\u2019s vision of inclusive development and good\ngovernance that we are consistently moving forward and are poised to achieve the goal of building a New\nIndia by 2022.\n\nWhen the BJP government was formed in 2014, the country was faced with the challenge of turning around\nthe wheel of development that had been stalled because of rampant corruption, misrule and indecisiveness\nof the UPA government, under whose rule the country had been pushed into the darkness of despair. For a\ndecade, India had a government with no clarity of intentions, lacking strong leadership which could take\ncrucial decisions and bereft of a policy directive devoted to the welfare of the people. In the last five years,\nwe have been successful in lifting the country out of the morass of problems inherited from 10 years of\nmisrule by the UPA government, while also increasing the pace of development.\n\nIn the last five years, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the NDA government has\nsuccessfully vindicated the mandate that it won in 2014. With the will to transform the hopes of 100 million\nof fellow citizens into a solid \u2018trust\u2019, we have pledged to take the country forward on the path of progress.\n\nAfter running a government devoted to the welfare of the common citizen for five years, we can proudly say\nthat we have not only successfully achieved our goals, but have empowered millions of Indians to become\nself-reliant and capable of fulfilling their dreams and aspirations. This government has made historic efforts\nmade towards empowerment of the ordinary Indian, establishment of a strong and transparent system of\ngovernance andinculcating the spirit of unity and fulfilment of the vision of \u2018Ek Bharat ,Shreshtha Bharat\u2019.\n\n \n\f\n \n\n\u00bb\n\nIn order to achieve the highest goals of agricultural development, we have undertaken the unprecedented\nmeasure of making the agriculture sector \u2018farmer centric\u2019. As a result of our efforts in this sector, we are now\nmoving rapidly towards the goal of doubling the income of farmers by 2022. By increasing the Minimum\nSupport Price of crops by 1.5 times the cost, we have ensured a fair value for their yield. Through the Prime\nMinister Kisan Samman Nidhi, the government has provided financial support to farmers by giving them an\nassistance of Rs. 6,000 per year, transferred directly into their bank accounts. The BJP government has also\nensured that adequate warehousing and marketing opportunities are available to farmers, thereby\nreducing the chances of risk toa minimum.\n\nIn the last five years, the work done by our government for the development and empowerment of every\nsection of society including women, youth and weaker sections has instilled faith in every citizen that they\ncan move ahead on the path of progress with dignity. Prior to 2014, numerous projects lay idle for years\nbecause the UPA government had failed to work on them. This, in turn, resulted in the decrease of both the\nnumber and quality of basic amenities for the citizens of our country. By simplifying processes, we have\nachieved a historic success in bringing the economy back on track. 'One Nation, One Tax' has become a\nmilestone in the direction of indirect tax reform. Because of proactive and effective measures taken to\nensure the external and internal security of the country, the Prime Minister Modi-led government has given\nrise to a sense of security in the minds of the people. By accomplishing all these tasks, we have presented\nthe example of an accountable, sensitive and strong-willed government.\n\nThe BJP government has always considered people\u2019s participation of utmost importance in good\ngovernance and therefore ensured that people in general were given ample opportunities for participating\nin our initiatives and voicing their opinions. With this spirit, we have made an attempt to know \u2018Bharat Ke Man\nKi Baat' and taken this into account while defining our work for the next five years and in the formation of our\nvision document.\n\nWe connected crores of people under the \u2018Bharat Ke Man Ki Baat' dialogue which was a nationwide\ncampaign run by the BJP for a month. Millions of suggestions were shared with us through different means.\nOur manifesto is a document of expression of crores of suggestions and aspirations. With the aid of about\n7,700 suggestion boxes, 300 rath, more than 100 dialogue program, more than 4000 \u2018Bharat Ke Man Ki\nBaat' program and through the social media we have made an effort to gauge the \u2018Mann ki Baat\u2019 of people\nacross India. At the same time, we consulted many domain experts, whose suggestions constitute the basis\nof this vision document.\n\nThis vision document is the vision of an uninterrupted journey upon which we had embarked with the\nblessings of the people in 2014. By presenting our achievements in the last five years as a proof of our\ndedication, we are firmly committed to continue that journey in the coming five years. This vision document\nis our plan of action for achieving these objectives and to fulfil the aspirations of every Indian.\n\nSince this document is inspired by the \u2018will of the people\u2019, we dedicate it to the people by reiterating our\nunwavering commitment and dedication to the creation of a New India.\n\nRajnath Singh\nChairperson, Manifesto Committee\n\n \n\f\n \n \n\nTOWARDS A NEW INDIA\n\nAs a continuing government, we will build on the foundations laid out in the last five years in terms of re-\nestablishing macro-economic stability, building long-term frameworks of governance, raising India's\ninternational stature, introducing a non-nonsense approach to internal/external security, upgrading the\nstock of physical/social infrastructure and, most importantly, building a basic safety net for the deprived\nsection of our society. We have demonstrated what all can be achieved by a committed and decisive\nleadership that is not afraid to take hard decisions.\n\nInthe next five years, we promise to create growth opportunities for all citizens in every aspect of life. Sab ka\nSaath, Sab ka Vikas remains our guiding principle. We intend to reach out to a developed future while\nretaining our civilisational roots.\n\nIn order to achieve our long-term goals, we must first secure our country against internal and external\naggression. These threats need to be dealt with at their roots and our decisive leadership that will equip our\nsecurity apparatus with all the necessary tools. As we have already demonstrated, we intend to use our\nforeign policy, were necessary, in order to tackle the problem of global terrorism. Thus, we intend to\nincrease the strength of our diplomatic and allied cadres. We will also build on the \u201cMake in India in Defence\u201d\ninitiative to further indigenise our defense equipment.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi had promised, in his very first speech in Lok Sabha, that this government\nwould work for the welfare of the poorest. In the last five years, we have created a transparent mechanism\nfor directly delivering basic services to the bottom of the pyramid by leveraging Aadhaar, DBT and Jan Dhan\naccounts. Basic health has been a special focus with large investments made on sanitation (Swachh\nBharat), health insurance (Ayushmaan Bharat) and in modern medical facilities. We intend to accelerate the\npace of providing access to basic amenities such as housing, electricity, toilet, cooking gas, and\nhealth/social security to every poor Indian household, rural and urban, in the next five years and to bring the\npercentage of population below the poverty line to single digits.\n\nIn the last five years, we re-imposed macro-economic stability while building lasting frameworks for\neconomic governance. These frameworks include the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, inflation-targeting,\nnationwide Goods & Services Tax, and the banking sector clean-up. These efforts have not only changed\nthe business culture of the country and anchored inflation at 4 percent, but have also been internationally\nrecognized with a sovereign rating upgrade and a sharp rise in our Ease of Doing Business ranking. We will\nensure that India remains the world's fastest growing major economy in future while maintaining macro-\nstability. We aspire to be the world's third largest economy by 2030.\n\nSince our economic model is based on entrepreneurship and innovation, we commit to simplifying and\nlowing tax rates. An important aspect of the ease of doing business is the ability to enforce contracts and\nresolve disputes. Therefore, we promise to significantly increase the capacity of the legal system within five\nyears in partnership/co-ordination with the judiciary.\n\nThe physical infrastructure of the country has undergone an unprecedented upgrade in the last five years.\nWe have connected 91% of villages with rural roads, electrified 100% of villages, operationalized 36 new\nairports and introduced metro networks in several cities. Looking ahead, we plan to build 60,000 km of\nNational Highways, connect 100% of villages with rural roads, operationalize 100 new airports, modernize\n400 railway stations, and cover 50 cities with metro networks.\n\n \n\n \n\f\n\u2014_\n\n \n\n \n \n\nAgriculture employs a large proportion of our labour force. In order to ensure remunerative prices for\nfarmers, the minimum support price for 22 crops was increased to 1.5 times cost of production. In addition,\nwe have curbed the large-scale diversion of subsidized farm inputs through measures like Neem-coating\nof urea, rolled out electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM), provided insurance cover to 14 crore\nfarmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and, most recently, introduced direct income support\nfor 12 crore farming families through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. In the next five years, we will\ncreate a National Warehousing Grid, invest Rs25 lakh crores in farm/rural productivity, introduce interest-\nfree Kisan Credit Cards and extend the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi to all farmers. We remain\ncommitted to the promise of doubling farmer incomes by 2022 and more resources will be made available if\nnecessary.\n\nIn the last five years, we have created a national common market for the industry and services sectors. By\nlowering inflation and cleaning up the banking system, we are now in a position to structurally lower the real\ncost of capital. This is key to a sustained increase in private sector investment. We intend to establish a\nNational Traders' Welfare Board as well as announce a National Policy for Retail Trade. The tourism sector will\nbe a special focus. We will make sure that all UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India have facilities of\ninternational standard. We will also identify and promote specific sites of cultural/natural importance as a\nnational priority (while being sensitive to their preservation).\n\nThe cultural, ecological and social capital of a country are just as important as its economic capital. These\ntoo need continuous investment and we intend to expand support for protecting cultural/linguistic\nheritage, conserving sites of ecological/historical importance, and promoting our civilizational ideas both\ninternationally and to the next generation. We reiterate our stand to explore all possibilities within the\nframework of the Constitution to facilitate the construction of aRam Temple in Ayodhya.\n\nWe remain committed to ensuring the benefits of constitutional provisions to the Scheduled Castes,\nScheduled Tribes and backward classes. We recently introduced a further 10% reservation for the\neconomically backward sections of the non-reserved category. At the same time, we will expeditiously\ncomplete the National Registration of Citizens in Assam and actively consider its extension to other states.\n\nEvery society progresses through the empowerment of women, inclusion of minorities and the\nencouragement of youth. We will not allow these objectives to be held back by the politics of appeasement.\nTherefore, we hope to modernize personal laws to prohibit practices such as Talaq-e-Biddat and Nikah\nHalala. We intend to invest in our human potential by focusing on the quality of our primary/secondary\nschools as well as expanding our tertiary education capacity. In addition, we will also invest in a select set of\nuniversities and research institutions in order make them world class.\n\nFor three generations, India's socio-economic system was held hostage to dynastic perpetuation. This\npropagated a corrupt, self-servicing system of political patronage that came to pervade every aspect of\nlife in India. In 2014, the country voted decisively to end this system. Under the leadership of PM Modi, every\neffort has been made to re-establish probity in public life, introduce transparency in policy-making and in\nthe management of national assets as well as to bring offenders to book.\n\nThe above summary is based on the vision of Prime Minister Modi to build a technologically modern,\nentrepreneurial, rules-based economy that is secure from external/internal security threats and\nsimultaneously able to build onits cultural, ecological and social assets.\n\n \n\f\n \n\nRem\n\nThe decisive leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has fundamentally altered the national\nsecurity paradigm of India in the last five years. Looking ahead, we propose to do the following:\n\nZero-Tolerance Approach to Terrorism\n\nOur security doctrine will be guided by our national security interest only. This is exemplified by the\nSurgical Strikes and the Air Strikes carried out recently. We will firmly continue our policy of \u2018Zero\nTolerance\u2019 against terrorism and extremism and will continue to follow our policy of giving a free hand\nto our security forces in combating terrorism.\n\nNational Security\n\nStrengthening our Armed Forces - We will speed up the purchases of outstanding defense related\nequipments and weapons. In order to equip the Armed Forces with modern equipment, we will\ncontinue to take focused steps to strengthen the strike capability of the Armed Forces.\n\nSelf-reliance in defence sector - In order to ensure self-reliance in procurement of defence\nequipment, we have taken several effective steps in the last five years. For instance, the most modern\nAK-203 automatic rifles are being manufactured at Amethi under our \u2018Make in India in Defence\u2019\ninitiative. We are committed to focus on 'Make in India in Defence\u2019 to enable indigenous production of\ndefence equipment. This will also generate employment and encourage investment in the defence\nsector.\n\nWelfare of Soldiers\n\nWe have already demonstrated our commitment to the welfare of our veterans with the\nimplementation of long delayed OROP. To take this commitment forward, we promise to create a more\neffective framework for the resettlement of our Armed Forces veterans. Under this effort, the Armed\nForces will start planning for the resettlement of soldiers three years before their retirement and in\naccordance with their preferences. This will include provision for skills training, soft skills training,\nfinancial support for higher education, for housing and for starting an enterprise.\n\nModernization of Police Forces\n\nWe will continue to take forward the process of modernizing the Central Armed Police Forces to\nfurther increase their capacity and readiness and enable them to effectively combat internal security\nchallenges.\n\nWe will provide assistance to the states to upgrade their police forces through the \u2018Scheme for\nModernization of Police Forces\u2019. We will encourage expedited police reforms in the states so as to\nenable the State police forces to deal with new types of crimes like cyber crime and help them to be\nmore sensitive to the citizens, especially the weak and vulnerable sections of the society.\n\nCombating Infiltration\n\nThere has been a huge change in the cultural and linguistic identity of some areas due to illegal\nimmigration, resulting in an adverse impact on local people's livelihood and employment. We will\nexpeditiously complete the National Register of Citizens process in these areas on priority. In future we\nwillimplement the NRC ina phased manner in other parts of the country.\n\nWe will continue to undertake effective steps to prevent illegal immigration in the Northeastern states.\nFor this, we will further strengthen our border security. A pilot project on the use of technology to\nstrengthen border security (Smart Fencing) was implemented in Dhubri (Assam). We will implement\nthis onall borders.\n\n \n\f\nReinforcing Border Security\n\nWe will focus on creation of developmental and other necessary infrastructure in border areas to\nensure that border security is strengthened, and to enable increased participation of and benefits for\nborder areas in the country\u2019s development and progress.\n\nWe have completed building six integrated check-posts with another under construction to facilitate\neasier trade and travel from the neighboring countries. We will further ease the movement of goods\nand people by constructing 14 more integrated check-posts by 2024. After completion of all the\nproposed integrated check-posts, all trade movement with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan will be\nconducted through the integrated check-posts.\n\nCoastal Safety\n\nAfter effectively strengthening coastal security through implementation of a coastal security scheme\nto provide modern equipment and allocating funds to the states for establishing coastal police\nstations, establishment of National Committee for Strengthening Maritime & Coastal Security, Island\nInformation System and National Academy of Coastal Policing, we will continue to take steps for\nensuring security of India\u2019s long coastline.\n\nCitizenship Amendment Bill\n\nWe are committed to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Bill for the protection of\nindividuals of religious minority communities from neighbouring countries escaping persecution. We\nwill make all efforts to clarify the issues to the sections of population from the Northeastern states who\nhave expressed apprehensions regarding the legislation. We reiterate our commitment to protect the\nlinguistic, cultural and social identity of the people of Northeast. Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs and\nChristians escaping persecution from India\u2019s neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India.\n\nCombating Left Wing Extremism\n\nWe have already taken strong actions to reduce left wing extremism to a very large extent and limited\nthem to small pockets. We are committed to taking necessary and effective steps against left wing\nextremism to eliminate this menace in the next five years. In the last five years, we have focussed on\nthe development of economic and social infrastructure such as roads, mobile towers, schools and\nmedical facilities in the tribal areas affected by left wing extremism and we will continue to make\nefforts in this direction.\n\nJammu & Kashmir- Article 370\n\n* Inthe last five years, we have made all necessary efforts to ensure peace in Jammu and Kashmir\nthrough decisive actions and a firm policy. We are committed to overcome all obstacles that come\nin the way of development and provide adequate financial resources to all the regions of the state.\nWe reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of Article 370.\n\n\u00ab We are committed to annulling Article 35A of the Constitution of India as the provision is\ndiscriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Jammu and Kashmir. We believe\nthat Article 35A is an obstacle in the development of the state. We will take all steps to ensure a safe\nand peaceful environment for all residents of the state. We will make all efforts to ensure the safe\nreturn of Kashmiri Pandits and we will provide financial assistance for the resettlement of refugees\nfrom West Pakistan, Pakistan occupied Jammu and Kashmir (POJK) and Chhamb.\n\n \n  \n \n\nIndia supports peace,\nbut the country will not hesitate to take\nany steps required for national security\n\n- Shri Narendra Modi\n\n \n \n\n  \n\f\n8\n\n8 8\n\n \n\nDoubling Farmers\u2019 Income\n\nAt the very beginning of our current term, Prime Minister Modi embarked on a mission to double\nfarmers\u2019 income.

To further expand the warehousing infrastructure in the country, we\nwill establish a National Warehousing Grid along National Highways to ensure necessary logistical\nlinkages for warehousing of agricultural produce.\n\n* Toenable the farmer to store the agri-produce near his village and sell at a remunerative price at an\nappropriate time, we will roll out a new Village Storage Scheme of agri-produce. We will provide\nfarmers with loans at cheaper rates on the basis of storage receipt of the agri-produce.\n\nTo ensure greater promotion and increase profitability under organic farming, we will take the\nfollowing steps:\n\n\u00ab We will promote chemical-free organic farming in an additional 20 lakh hectare of hilly, tribal and\nrainfed areas in the next 5 years.\n\n* Wewilllauncha dedicated e-commerce portal to enhance the availability of organic produce to the\ndoorsteps of consumers.\n\n \n\f\n=\n\n \n\n* Goshalasin the country will be linked to the promotion of organic farming.\n\n\u00ab Promotion of organic eco-tourism in the vicinity of organic farming will also ensure additional\nincome to the farmers.\n\nNational Bee-keeping and Honey Mission: We will launch a National Bee-keeping and Honey\nMission to ensure additional returns to the farmers. We will double the honey production from the\npresent 1,15,000 MT by developing infrastructural facilities and providing marketing support.\n\nExpanding Irrigation in Mission Mode\n\nWe have completed work on the long-pending 31 irrigation projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi\nSinchai Yojana and work will soon be completed on the remaining 68 projects in phases up to\nDecember 2019. Continuing our efforts to developing irrigation, we will further expand Pradhan Mantri\nKrishi Sinchai Yojana to realize 100% irrigation potential of the country within a defined time-frame.\n\nWe will bring one crore hectares agricultural land under micro-irrigation, this would be supplemented\nwith \u2018fertigation\u2019 to promote judicious use of fertilizers.\n\nCooperatives\n\nWe recognize the role of cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) can play in ensuring\nbetter market linkages and opportunities in the agricultural sector and we are committed to support\nand strengthen them.\n\nWe will enable the creation of 10,000 new Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) by 2022 to ensure\neconomies of scale for farmers regarding access to inputs and markets.\n\nTo cater to the needs of big cities we will set up a mechanism of direct marketing of vegetables, fruits,\ndairy and fishery products through farmers\u2019 cooperative organizations so as to ensure better price\nreturn to the farmers.\n\nConvergence of Agriculture and Technology\n\nWe will create a mobile app based system for promoting the availability of agri-implements on\nrental/custom hiring basis.\n\nWe will extensively use technology to ensure a better knowledge of the market prices of various agro-\nproducts for the benefit of farmers.\n\nWe will enable development of young agri-scientists to take advantage of Artificial Intelligence,\nMachine Learning, Blockchain technology, Big Data analytics etc. for more predictive and profitable\nprecision agriculture.\n\nWe view solar energy as an additional source of income for farmers and will encourage solar farming\non a massive scale so as to enable the \u2018Annadaata\u2019(food provider) to become \u2018Urja-daata\u2019 (energy\nprovider).\n\nDigitization of Land Records - On the lines of Aachaar project, we will complete digitization of land\nrecords on a mission mode. We will implement second-generation land reforms to ensure title\nguarantee for the landholder and reduce land-related litigation. We will create a model law for\nconclusive titling (in consultation with states) promoting title guarantee and title insurance and work\nwith States to implement this system.\n\n \n\f\nWe have given utmost importance to the dairy sector and have established Kamdhenu Aayog for the\nconservation of indigenous species of cows. We will establish a network of mobile veterinary\ndispensaries to provide doorstep service to farmers.\n\nWe will roll out a model programme for periodic health checkup of all cattle and other domestic\nanimals at the district level with the help of veterinary experts from the public and private sector.\n\nWe will expand the coverage of immunization and eliminate Foot and Mouth Disease and Brucellosis.\n\nWe will launch a National Feed and Fodder Mission to eliminate the shortage of fodder.\n\nWe will launch \u2018Matsya Sampada Yojana\u2019 with an allocation of Rs. 10,000 crores to ensure availability of\nstorage and marketing tools and infrastructure like ice-boxes, cold storages, ice-plants etc. for small\nand traditional fishermen.\n\nWe will promote aquaculture through easy access to credit.\n\nWe will facilitate farming of sea-weed, pearl as well as ornamental fish to ensure a better return to the\nfishermen.\n\nWe will bring all fishermen under the ambit of all welfare programmes and social security schemes\nwith expanded coverage for accident insurance.\n\n \n\f\nOn the Path of Gram Swaraj\n\nGram Swaraj is one of the principal pillars of Mahatma Gandhi's vision of India. As we approach the\n150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Bharatiya Janata Party resolves to realize his vision of\nGram Swaraj by ensuring that everyone has equitable access to resources. As India reaches the\ndefining milestone of the 75th year of its independence in 2022, we pledge to adopt the ideals of Gram\nSwaraj as envisaged by Mahatma Gandhi. Inline with this vision we promise:\n\nee 2\n\nSujal\n\nSaashray _\u00bb\n(Housing) (Drinking Water)\nWe will ensure a pucca house to We will launch \u2018Jal Jivan Mission\u2019\nevery family who are living in a : under which we will introduce a\nkuchha house by 2022. : special program, \u2018Nal se Jal\u2019 to\n\nensure piped water connection\nto every household by 2024.\n\n>\n\nSuchna se Sashaktikaran  _ Sadak se Samriddhi\n(Digital connectivity (Road connectivity)\nthrough Bharatnet) We will launch a massive \u2018Rural\n. : Road Upgradation Programme\u2019\nWe will ensure that every Gram to connect centres of\nPanchayat is connected through education, healthcare centres,\na high speed optical fibre and markets with hinterlands to\nnetwork by 2022. promote rural growth.\ns\n\nSwachhata se Sampannata\n(Swachh Bharat Mission)\n\nWe will ensure 100% disposal of\nliquid waste water and reuse of\nwaste water.\n\n \n\f\n \n\nIndia as the World\u2019s 3rd Largest Economy\n\nRoadmap for 5 trillion dollar economy\n\nIndia was branded as \u2018fragile five\u2019 in 2014. Within five years, we have turned India into a bright spot that\nis not only the fastest growing major economy of the world but also enjoys macroeconomic stability.\nWe have already become the world\u2019s sixth largest economy and will soon be among the top five. We\naspire to make India the third largest economy of the world by 2030. This implies that we commit to\nmake IndiaaUS $5 trillion economy by 2025 and US $ 10 trillion economy by 2032.\n\nWhen compared to all governments post-1991, this government has delivered the highest rate of\naverage GDP growth (7.3%) over the last five years and maintained lowest rate of average consumer\ninflation (4.6%). The consumer inflation is presently at 2.6%. This has been achieved with lower fiscal\ndeficits and significantly lower current account deficit as a percentage of GDP. Average fiscal deficit\nas a percentage of GDP during 2014-19 has been brought down to 3.7% from 5.4% during 2009-14.\nReduction in fiscal deficit of this order implies less burden of debt on future generations by almost\nRs.16 lakh crores. Average Current account deficit as a percentage of GDP during this government has\nbeen reduced to 1.5% from 3.3% during 2009-14.\n\nTax Policy\n\nOur economic policy has been guided by the principle of lowering the tax rate and improving\ncompliance; thereby broadening of the tax base. With improved compliance and increased tax base,\nthe tax to GDP ratio has reached 12%, highest in the recent past, up from 10.1% in 2013-14. This\nincreased revenue has been deployed for benefits to the poor and creation of infrastructure at an\nunprecedented level. We will continue with our policy in the similar manner \u2014 lowering of tax rate\nthereby rewarding honest tax payers and improving compliance.\n\nGoods and Service Tax\n\nGoods and Service Tax (GST) has resulted in overall lowering of tax rates and increased revenue\ncollection, particularly for States. When compared to base year of 2015-16, GST revenue for all states\nhave increased by 50% in three years. We will continue with the simplification of GST process by\nengaging in dialogue with all stakeholders.\n\n100 lakh crore Investment\n\nWhile social security net for the poor and farmers will be expanded, we will take up capital investment\nin the country to a new height. By 2024, we will make capital investment of Rs.100 lakh crore in the\ninfrastructure sector. We recognize that investment driven growth requires cheaper cost of capital. By\nanchoring inflation at 4% and cleaning up our banking system we have created the space for structural\nreduction in the cost of capital. This will not only help infrastructure investment but investment also in\nthe wider economy. Thus, new India will be built on the basis of investment driven growth.\n\n \n\f\n@\n\n \n\nMake In India\n\nWith the aim of developing India into a knowledge based, skill supported and technology driven\nsociety, we have launched the \u2018Make in India\u2019 campaign. A beginning has already been made through\nour initiatives like Digital India, Startup India and Skill India. To bring in fast and inclusive growth, we\nhave also carried out substantial reforms in the last few years in terms of de-regulation and de-\nlicensing, with an aim to improve ease of doing business. More than 90% FDI approvals are now\nthrough the automatic route. FDI has grown by almost 50% in the last five years. Similarly,\nimplementation of One Nation, One Tax through GST has brought all businesses under single tax net.\n\nMaking India a global manufacturing hub - as we position India as a global manufacturing hub over\nthe next five years, we will take the following steps:\n\n* Top 50 Ranking in Ease of Doing Business Index- In the last four years, India has climbed 65 places\nin the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index. We will further work in this direction to take the\ncountry\u2019s ranking into the top 50.\n\n* Strengthening Companies Act - In order to incentivize compliance of law and ease of doing\nbusiness, we will amend the Companies Act to impose civil liability for technical and procedural\ndefaults of aminor nature thus unclogging the majority of the cases from the courts.\n\n\u00a2 New Industrial Policy - We will announce a new industrial policy to improve competitiveness of\nmanufacturing and services with an eye on Industry 4.0 in order to gear up for technologies like\nartificial intelligence and electric mobility. Special effort will be made for MSMEs.\n\n\u00ab Network Approach for Growth - We understand that clustering and network effects are\nimportant in order to build competitiveness in cutting edge industries. Therefore, we will invest in\ncreating clusters/networks that can take on the world\u2019s best. Public procurement and\ngovernmentincentives will be used actively to build up these clusters and encourage job creation.\n\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises\n\nAspecial package was launched by the Government to boost the MSME sector. The Credit Guarantee\nScheme of the Government of India is an important component wherein loans to MSME are\nguaranteed. Under this alone, the credit of around Rs.19,000 crore was achieved in 2017-18. We would\naim to take this figure to Rs.1,00,000 crore by 2024.\n\nTechnology access and upgradation are key elements in the MSME sector. Our government has taken\namajor step in expanding of \u2018Technology Centres\u2019 and we would achieve more than 150 such centres\nall over the country by 2024. These Technology Centres would help in mentoring skilling and proto-\ntyping of MSMEs. They will expose MSMEs to Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Internet of Things, Virtual\nReality, BlockChain technology and Zero Defect Zero Effect.\n\nThe Technology Centres, other skilling centres of MSMEs and NSICs incubation centres alone would\nprovide focussed and high level skilling to more than 6 lakh people per year.\n\nWelfare of Small Traders -\n\n\u00a2 Wewill establish National Traders\u2019 Welfare Board and create a National Policy for Retail Trade for\nthe growth of retail businesses.\n\n* Toprotect the interests of small traders, we will provide an accident insurance of 10 lakh rupees to\nall the traders registered under GST.\n\n* On the lines of Kisan credit card, we will also create a scheme to give merchant credit card to\nregistered merchants.\n\n \n\f\n \n\nEntrepreneurship & StartUps\n\nTo encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship amongst the youth, we will launch a new scheme to\nprovide collateral-free credit up to 50 lakh for entrepreneurs. We will guarantee 50% of the loan\namount for female entrepreneurs and 25% of the loan amount for male entrepreneurs.\n\nIndia is now among the largest Startup ecosystems of the world. We will further strengthen this\necosystem by:\n\n\u00a2 Easing regulatory requirement for start-ups\n\n* Targeting time spent for tax compliance at 1hour per month\n\n* Facilitating establishment of 50,000 newStartups in the nation by 2024\n\u00a2 Creating 100 Innovation Zones in Urban Local Bodies\n\n* Setting up 500 new incubators and accelerators by 2024\n\n\u00a2 Initiating ranking of Central Ministries, departments, State Governments and CPSUs for their\nincreased engagement with start-ups and in bringing in innovation and newer technologies and\nglobal practices and skills.\n\nWe will continue to promote and encourage Startups through creation of a \u2018Seed Startup Fund\u2019 of\n%20,000 crore.\n\nWe will support entrepreneurial ventures started by individuals from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled\nTribes, Other Backward Communities, or Economically Weaker Sections and take forward the \u2018Stand-\nup India\u2019 initiative.\n\nWe will set-up new \u2018Entrepreneurial Northeast\u2019 scheme to provide financial support to the micro, small\nand medium industries and for employment generation in the Northeastern state.\n\nUsing Tourism to Cluster Services\n\nWithin the services sector, tourism will be special focus because it brings together many different\nservice segments.\n\nIn particular, we will identify specific places of cultural or natural importance in order to develop them\nas comprehensive destinations instead of leaving them as isolated sites. This requires that we look at\ntransport connection, heritage conservation, hotels, restaurants, entertainment and other services in\nan integrated way. We will make an effort to ensure that all these services interconnect. Therefore, the\ngovernment will make sure that schemes/ agencies such as Swachh Bharat, ASI, forest department\nand local government work together with the travel and hospitality industry. All UNESCO heritage\nsites in India willbe upgraded to international level facilities.\n\nThe North eastern states and our Island/coastal areas will be developed while being sensitive to\nconserving their ecological uniqueness. Similarly, places of cultural importance will be developed\nwhile maintaining their unique heritage. As we have recently demonstrated by projects in Varanasi, an\neffort will be made to upgrade these sites while being sensitive to their historical/cultural heritage.\n\nTransparent economy\n\nWe will continue our crackdown on Benami properties and illegal foreign bank accounts to benefit\nhonest taxpayers and the poor of the country. We will also expedite our actions to bring fugitive\neconomic offenders back to India and prosecute them for their crimes.\n\nInternational Trade\n\nWe will ensure faster customs clearance of international cargo by relaxing clearance procedures,\nintroducing self-declaration etc and adopting new scanning technology. We will also provide\nadequate financial and institutional support for exporters and export organizations to build capacity\nand equip them with adequate information to ensure unhindered exports.\n\n \n\f\n \n\nInfrastructure]\n\nFoundation for New India\n\nInfrastructure is the backbone of any economy. In the 10 years of UPA rule, policy paralysis and\ncorruption had derailed infrastructural development. The last five years, under the leadership of Prime\nMinister Modi, infrastructural roll out has been put back on track. For the first time, India has started\nmarching and is being seen on the path of global standards in infrastructure and civic amenities. The\nspeed of constructing rural roads has doubled and 90% of rural road connectivity has been achieved.\nFurthermore, India has become a net exporter of electricity and has achieved maximum production of\ncoal and maximum distribution of LED bulbs. There has been an unprecedented rise in the port\ncapacity and the speed of setting up new rail lines, gauge conversion, and electrification of railway\ntracks has doubled. We have invested at an unprecedented level in building infrastructure in the last\nfive years. This includes massive budgetary allocation for railways, highways, village roads and other\nhealth as well as educational infrastructure. We have also started and matured into a new technology\ndriven platform called PRAGATI (Pro-active Governance and Timely Implementation). Through this,\nmechanism, we are de-bottlenecking major projects on a regular basis through video conference with\nofficials across the country. Going forward,\n\nWe will aim at next generation infrastructure which will include gas grids and water grids, i-ways,\nregional airports and way side amenities along National highways.\n\nWe will continue the fast pace with more and more public and private investment and efficient ground\nlevel management on building of infrastructure further and to improve the quality of life and enhance\nthe ease of living.\n\nIn addition to ensuring efficiency in the economy this will also lead to creation of a large number of jobs\nandlivelihood opportunities.\n\nEnsuring Urban Development\n\nThrough the development of infrastructure and connectivity, we will ensure the further development\nof suburban townships and new urban centres.\n\nWe will set up five regional centres of excellence on urban issues. These centres will provide support to\nstates and local bodies on issues of urban governance and growth.\n\nUrban Mobility -We will launch a National Urban Mobility Mission to provide technology based urban\nmobility solutions to all urban local bodies and increase the use of public transport, enhance\nwalkability and cycle use. Under this mission, we will incentivize cities to integrate the public transport\nsystems such as metro, local trains and local buses with the private service providers inthe sector such\nas, private bus operator, private taxi operator, the auto-rickshaw, e-rickshaw services, pedestrian and\ncycling infrastructure for a seamless and smooth last mile connectivity. We will also promote a\ncommon mobility card/ ticketing across different modes of transport.\n\nInthe next five years, we will ensure that 50 cities are covered witha strong metro network.\n\nSwachh Bharat Mission\n\nWe have constructed over 9 crore toilets under our flagship programme, Swachh Bharat Mission. We\nwill take the Mission to a new level through sustainable Solid Waste Management in every village.\nThrough the mission, we will ensure 100% disposal of liquid waste through emphasis on faecal sludge\nmanagement and reuse of waste water in rural, peri urban and unsewered areas.\n\nWe will ensure that all habitations attain open defecation free status and those that have attained the\nstatus sustain the behavioural change.\n\n \n\n20\n\f\nary\nnN\n\nary =\niS wo\n\n8e68cac 8\nS\n\n \n\nJal Shakti\n\nWater is a critical resource but its management is spread across various departments, even at the\nCentral level. We will form a new Ministry of Water unifying the water management functions to\napproach the issue of water management holistically and ensure better coordination of efforts. The\nMinistry will expeditedly take forward the ambitious programme, conceptualized by Shri Atal Bihari\nVajpayee, for linking rivers from different parts of the country and ensure a solution to the problems of\ndrinking water and irrigation. We will initiate work on this programme by constituting an authority.\n\nWe will launch \u2018Jal Jivan Mission\u2019 under which we will introduce a special programme, \u2018Nal se Jal\u2019 to\nensure piped water for every household by 2024.\n\nWe will ensure sustainability of water supply through special focus on conservation of rural water\nbodies and ground water recharge.\n\nRoad Connectivity\n\nIn continuation to our existing milestone of constructing roads at an unprecedented pace, we will\nconstruct 60,000 kms of National Highways in the next five years.\n\nWe will double the length of National Highways by 2022.\n\nWe will complete the Phase-1 of Bharatmala Project expeditiously. We will also launch Bharatmala 2.0\nproject especially with a view to support the states to develop state road networks connecting the\ninterior regions to the main roads and to effectively leverage the economic potential and market\nopportunities of the concerned regions.\n\nWe will bring in new technologies and designs in road construction, operation and maintenance.\n\nWe want to become a world leader in e-mobility. 10,000 crores have already been allocated to launch\na programme for promoting clean energy and battery operated vehicles. We will further work on this\nfront to ensure expansion of this new mobility experience.\n\nRailways\n\nWe have made all efforts to make the experience of rail journey safe, smooth, clean and satisfying and\nhave achieved great results. We will continue the pace of work in this regard and encourage private\nparticipation in the development of railway amenities and infrastructure and provision of services.\n\nWe will ensure conversion of all viable rail tracks to broad gauge by 2022.\nWe will make all efforts to ensure electrification of all railway tracks by 2022.\n\nWe will expand connectivity and experience of high speed trains and new version trains such as Vande\nBharat Express across the length and breadth of the country in the next five years.\n\nWe will complete the dedicated freight corridor project by 2022.\nWe will launcha massive programme for modernization of railway stations in the country.\n\nWe will equip all main railway stations with Wi-Fi facility by 2022.\n\n \n\n21\n\f\nNy\nI\n\n \n\nEstablishment of New Airports\n\nIn 2014 there were 65 functional airports and there are a total of 101 functional airports today. In the\nnext five years, we will double the number of functional airports.\n\nCoastal Development\n\nPotential of coastal development for transportation, tourism and for economic upliftment of coastal\ncommunities has remained unexploited in the country. To exploit this potential fully, we have launched\ntheSagarmala programme and will ensure speedy completion of the projects under this programme.\n\nWe will double our port capacity in the next five years.\n\nWe will further encourage integrated development of coastal areas including coastal cities, coastal\ntransport and coastal industrialization.\n\nWe will undertake the upgradation of infrastructure for connecting the coast and hinterland to ensure\nsmooth transportation.\n\nWe will continue to focus on development of inland waterways for shifting inland cargo movement\nfrom road and rail to water transport.\n\nEnergy\n\nWe had made a commitment to provide 24x7 electricity to all and the country has substantially\nattained the goal.

India has a long history and has been recognised by others as a land of\ngreat wealth and even greater wisdom. But India has also experienced continued\nforeign attacks and alien rule for centuries and this has resulted in a loss of pride in\nIndia and its remarkable achievements. Indians, particularly educated under the\nsystem of education imposed by the Britishers, have lost sight of not only the cultural\nand civilisational greatness of India, but also of its technological achievements and\n\nabounding natural resources.\n\nHistory tells us that India was a land of abundance. The country has been\nblessed with great natural fertility, abundant water and unlimited sunshine.\nAccording to foreigners visiting this country, Indians were regarded as the best\nagriculturists in the world. Records of these travels from the 4\u00b0 Century BC till early-\n19\" Century speak volumes about our agricultural abundance which dazzled the\nworld. The Thanjaur (900-1200 AD) inscriptions and Ramnathapuram (1325 AD)\ninscriptions record 15 to 20 tonnes per hectare production of paddy. Now, even\nafter the first green revolution, according to Government statistics, Ludhiana in the\nlate-20\" Century recorded a production of 5.5 tonnes of paddy per hectare. It is,\ntherefore, imperative that India rediscovers an agricultural technology which\nincorporates all the inputs from our own wisdom and agricultural skills that made\n\nus a land of abundance in food.\n\nIndian economy was as flourishing as its agriculture. Foreigners from\nMagasthenes to Fa-Hian and Hiuen-Tsiang have described and praised Indian\nmaterial prosperity. Indian villages around 1780 in Bihar have been cited as an\nexample of cleanliness and hospitality. The streets were swept and watered and the\npeople had a remarkable sense of hospitality and attention to accommodate the\nneeds of the travellers.\n\nOld British documents established that India was far advanced in the technical\nand educational fields than Britain of 18\" and early-19\" Century. Its agriculture\n\ntechnically and productively was far superior; it produced a much higher grade of\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\niron and steel. The Iron Pillar at Mehrauli in Delhi has withstood the ravages of time\nfor 1,500 years or more without any sign of rusting or decay. Metallurgists of the world\nhave marvelled at this high degree of sophistication in technology. Textiles formed the\ngreat industrial enterprise of pre-British India. Up to the late-18\" Century, India was\n\nthe leading producer and exporter of textiles; China was then a close second.\n\nIndian advancements in astronomy, mathematics, chemistry, physics and\nbiological sciences have been documented and recognised all over the world.\nContributions in the field of medicine and surgery are also well known. Ayurveda and\nYoga are the best gifts from India to the world in creating a healthy civilisation. India\nknew plastic surgery, practised it for centuries and, in fact, it has become the basis of\nmodern plastic surgery. India also practised the system of inoculation against small\n\npox centuries before the vaccination was discovered by Dr Edward Jenner.\n\nFa-Hian, writing about Magadha in 400 AD, has mentioned that a well organised\nhealth care system existed in India. According to him, the nobles and householders of\nthis country had founded hospitals within the city to which the poor of all countries,\nthe destitute, the crippled and the diseased may repair. \u201cThey receive every kind of\nrequisite help. Physicians inspect their diseases, and according to their cases, order\nthem food and drink, medicines or decoctions, everything in fact that contributes to\ntheir ease. When cured they depart at their ease.\u201d\n\nIt has been established beyond doubt by the several reports on education at the\nend of the 18\" Century and the writings of Indian scholars that not only did India have\na functioning indigenous educational system but that it actually compared more than\nfavourably with the system obtaining in England at the time in respect of the number\nof schools and colleges proportionate to the population, the number of students in\nschools and colleges, the diligence as well as the intelligence of the students, the quality\nof the teachers and the financial support provided from private and public sources.\nContrary to the then prevailing opinion, those attending school and college included\nan impressive percentage of lower caste students, Muslims and girls. Mahatma Gandhi\nwas absolutely right in saying that India was more illiterate in 1931 compared to its\nstate of literacy 50-60 years ago, i.e. in 1870. India had also an expertise in ship building,\nas also in extensive manufacturing and uses of dyes, and also in manufacturing paper.\n\nIndia had a share of about 22.5 per cent of world GDP in 1600 AD which\nduring British domination suffered a steep decline to 12.25 per cent in 1870, while the\nBritish share in the same period rose sharply from 1.8 per cent to 9.1 per cent. When\nBritishers left India, the economy was completely shattered and India\u2019s share in world\nmanufacture, trade and GDP declined further. Even after 62 years of Independence,\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nSOr\nIndia\u2019s share in world market remains less than one per cent.\n\nIndia\u2019s prosperity, its talents and the state of its high moral society can be best\nunderstood by what Thomas Babington Macaulay stated in his speech of February 02,\n1835, in the British Parliament. \u201cI have travelled across the length and breadth of\nIndia and I have not seen one person who is a beggar, who is a thief, such wealth I\nhave seen in this country, such high moral values, people of such high caliber, that I\ndo not think we would ever conquer this country, unless we break the very back bone\nof this nation, which is her spiritual and cultural heritage, and therefore, I propose\nthat we replace her old and ancient education system, her culture, for if the Indians\nthink that all that is foreign and English is good and greater than their own, they will\nlose their self esteem, their native culture and they will become what we want them, a\ntruly dominated nation.\u201d This policy was implemented very meticulously by Britishers\nand the education system was created to make Indian\u2019s ignorant about themselves.\n\nNo nation can chart out its domestic or foreign policies unless it has a clear\nunderstanding about itself, its history, its strength and failings. It becomes all the more\nimportant for any nation to know its roots which sustain its people in a highly mobile\nand globalised world. Leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Sri\nAurobindo, Mahatma Gandhi and others who spearheaded the freedom movement\nhad built the struggle around a clear vision of India\u2019s civilisational consciousness. Indian\nways of thought and action were in the centre of their political action. These leaders\nhad a vision to reconstruct the political and economic institutions of India as a\ncontinuum of the civilisational consciousness which made India one country, one people\nand one nation. It is unfortunate that the leaders of independent India quickly discarded\nthis vision and continued to work with the institutional structures created by the British\nwhich had nothing to do with India\u2019s world view and its vitality which were responsible\nfor its survival despite continued outside attacks and alien rule.\n\nDuring the six decades of our independence, governance of our country, except\nfor a short period, was with the Congress and its associates. It was most unfortunate\nthat they never thought of creating a socio-economic and political paradigm of\ngovernance drawing from the civilisational consciousness of India. They, instead, tried\nto emulate whatever was being practised in this or that Western country. The disastrous\n\nresults are before us.\n\nWhat was required after independence was to reorient India\u2019s polity to bring it\nin consonance with the seekings and sensibilities of the Indian people. Failure to do so\nhas resulted in a fractured society, vast economic disparities, terrorism and communal\n\nconflict, insecurity, moral, psychological and spiritual degradation, and a state\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\napparatus unable to handle any of these problems. Attempts are sometimes made to\napply palliatives to manage the affairs but nothing succeeds. What is needed is to\narrive at a consensus about the \u2018Idea\u2019 of India and also about the seekings and\npreferences of the people and how they find expression in various socio-economic,\npolitical organisations and cultural, aesthetic and ethical sensibilities of the people of\nIndia.\n\nThe civilisational consciousness of India has been well defined by the sages\nand philosophers and has its roots in Bharatiya or Hindu world view. This world\nview is holistic and spiritual. It accepts that diversity is inherent in the scheme of\ncreation; it is the manifestation of the same cosmic entity in different forms. Hence it\nnot only accepts diversity but respects it and even more celebrates it. Hindu or Bharatiya\nview of life seeks unity in diversity. It is an inclusive approach and one can say that\nHinduism is the most ennobling experience in spiritual co-existence. The Bharatiya\nmind has contemplated beyond national boundaries and the Vedic Rishi declared in\nthe hoary past \u2018Vasudhaiva Kutumbukam\u2019 - that the world is a family. The horizons of\nIndia\u2019s worldview are known to have extended from Bamiyan / Kandahar to\nBorobudur / Indonesia on the one hand, and Sri Lanka to Japan on the other. Imprints\nof Indian culture are found in some other parts of the world as well. In ancient times\nIndia was isolated in geography but not in cultural relationship, trade and commerce.\n\nThe belief in essential unity of mankind is a unique feature of Hindu thought.\nThe Vedic Rishi had also declared that \u2018Ekam Sad Viprah Bahudha Vadanti (truth or\nreality is one but wise men describe it in different ways). This is essentially a secular\nthought in the real sense of the term because it accepts that one can follow his own\npath to reach the ultimate. Hindus are well known for their belief in harmony of\nreligions. And because of this world view almost all religions practised in different\nparts of the world have existed peacefully in India and will continue to do so.\n\nBut it appears that even after six decades of independence India has not been\nable to discover its innate vitality and its sense of time and consequently has lost its\ndirection and will to act. The drift is acute and has encompassed all aspects of national\nlife. The situation needs a change and a new paradigm is called for, for creating a\nprosperous, progressive and powerful India whose voice is heard in international\nfora.\n\nIndia can achieve this goal provided the people seriously set to this task. We\nare endowed with vast human and material resources. Indian youth have\ndemonstrated their capabilities in various walks of life and proved their competence.\nIn science and technology, space and atomic energy, despite handicaps and lack of\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\n\u2014O =\n\nworld class facilities, they have done remarkably well. In industry, business and\nmanagement and information communication technology, they have successfully\ntaken challenging risks. With this energetic and vibrant youth power and by prudently\nharnessing natural resources, Indians can perform miracles provided they work with\nself-confidence and pride in India. We have to assure a prominent role and full\nopportunities to our youth in the decision-making process. They are the future and\nthe propellers of our prosperity.\n\nIndia need not blindly copy this or that model of development; it should evolve\na model suited to its genius and resources. The Integral Humanism suggested by Pt.\nDeen Dayal Upadhyay provides such a model. India should be original, India should\ninnovate, and India should move upwards on the ladder of global leadership. The\nglobal scenario demands a solution, a radical solution to save the world from the\nimpending disaster of the Great Economic Recession and terrorism looming large all\nover the world. India is destined to play its historic role at this crucial juncture and for\nthis the BJP is committed to work for creating a modern, powerful, prosperous,\nprogressive and secure India.\n\nDr Murli Manohar Joshi\nChairman\n\nManifesto Committee\nApril 3, 2009.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nFOR STABILITY & SECURITY\nINDIA NEEDS A DECISIVE LEADER\n\nquirk of fate brought the Congress to power at the Centre in the summer of 2004. The\n\nUnited Progressive Alliance that it put together, which was able to secure parliamentary\nmajority with the help of the Left parties, has shown remarkable lack of cohesiveness with\nindividual Ministers representing the Congress\u2019 allies running their allotted Ministries like their\npersonal fiefdom. This was a Government totally divorced from the twin principles of collective\nresponsibility and accountability.\n\nThe nation was thus burdened with a Prime Minister who was in office but not in power;\nand, a Government that was in power but not in authority. This was supposed to be a Government\nthat would work for the welfare of the \u2018aam admi\u2019 - the common man. As it prepares to exit\noffice after five years, the Government has nothing to show by way of extending a \u2018hand\u2019 to the\n\u2018aam admi\u2019.\n\nThis Government will be remembered for four things. It was headed by the weakest\nPrime Minister the country has ever had. Its reversal of NDA\u2019s policies has led to a mounting\nsense of insecurity fuelled by repeated terrorist attacks, Maoist insurgency and separatist violence\nwhich together have claimed hundreds of innocent lives. Its gross mismanagement of the economy\nhas caused inflation, job losses and lockouts. And, it has shielded corruption at high places by\nmisusing agencies of the state, namely the CBI.\n\nThe Congress has tried to whitewash its terrible record on the national security front,\nespecially its abysmal failure to protect citizens from terrorism, by making cosmetic changes in\nantiquated laws. This is clearly not enough. It has sought to gloss over the increasing cost of\nfood, which is eight per cent higher than in 2008, and many times more than in 2004, by projecting\nmisleading statistics.\n\nLakhs of people in the unorganised sector have lost their jobs over the past year. Skilled\nworkers are losing their jobs in the organised sector. This is far worse than unemployment\nbecause it impoverishes families dependent on assured income and dampens the national spirit.\n\n*\n\nThe worst hit are India\u2019s youth, especially those who are looking forward to enter the\njob market. The Congress-led UPA Government has gifted them with a bleak future.\n\nAs for the poor, they feel abandoned by the Congress-led regime. The much-publicised\nNational Rural Employment Guarantee Programme has turned out to be as much a flop as all\nother schemes of the Government. It is a telling comment on the UPA\u2019s performance that a\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\n\u2014O =\n\nwhopping 55 million people have been pushed below the poverty line over the past five years.\nThis is according to a study by the Indian Statistical Institute, based on data collated by the\nNational Sample Survey Organisation; the real figure could be much higher.\n\nIn rural India, thousands of farmers have committee suicide to escape the burden of\nmounting debt and grinding poverty. They are victims of Government apathy.\n\nAn equally damning indictment of the Congress-led UPA regime is galloping urban\npoverty. An estimated 23.7 per cent of the population in cities and towns lives in slums, according\nto \u2018India: Urban Poverty Report, 2009\u2019, amid squalor, crime, disease and tension.\n\nSuch glaring deprivation and denial, such rising numbers of people below the poverty\nline, contradict this nation\u2019s aspirations. They are obstacles to India\u2019s emergence as a great\npower and need to be removed through remedial Government intervention.\n\nThe stability of the NDA years helped India to prosper. The drift of the UPA years has\nput India in reverse gear. The BJP will restore the stability which India desperately needs.\n\n*\n\nThe BJP, immediately upon coming to power, will address the key issues of security and\neconomy. It will resume the employment-generating, prosperity-creating policies of the NDA\nGovernment headed by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, through massive investments in infrastructure\nprojects, by nursing agriculture back to health, and by making credit easily accessible to industry,\nwhile ensuring the safety and security of all people from the depredations of terrorists.\n\nIndia today faces a severe crisis of leadership. The nation needs a determined and decisive\nleader who has the capacity, commitment and conviction to take command of the situation and\nlead from the front. The country needs a leader who can restore Government's credibility and\nthe people\u2019s confidence in themselves. The polity needs a leader who values consensus over\nconflict, consultation over confrontation. Then alone can good governance replace the all-round\nfailure of the Congress.\n\nThat leader is Shri L.K. Advani.\n\nShri Advani has an exemplary record of service to the nation covering over six decades.\nA leader of impeccable integrity, he was one of the chief crusaders for democracy during the\nEmergency (1975-77) and spent 19 months in jail. He led the Ayodhya movement, the biggest\nmass movement in India since Independence, and initiated a powerful debate on cultural\nnationalism and the true meaning of secularism. Along with Shri Vajpayee, he was the principal\narchitect of the BJP\u2019s triumph, as the head of the National Democratic Alliance, in forming a\nstable and successful non-Congress coalition Government at the Centre (1998-2004). As India\u2019s\nDeputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, he ably assisted Shri Vajpayee in steering the ship\nof the nation through difficult waters.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nThe BJP is proud that it is seeking the people\u2019s mandate in the 2009 general election,\nalong with its allies in the NDA, under the leadership of Shri Advani.\n\n*\n\nThe BJP is contesting the 2009 15\" Lok Sabha election on a Manifesto that commits the\nparty to an agenda for change guided by three goals: GOOD GOVERNANCE,\nDEVELOPMENT and SECURITY. Our focus will be on the nation\u2019s youth, on addressing their\nconcerns and helping them achieve their aspirations. We will lay emphasis on empowerment\nthrough excellence by providing quality education. We will ensure the security of life and property.\nReviving the economy, re-orienting it towards agriculture, rural development, and unorganised\nand informal sectors; creating adequate employment opportunities for the youth; pushing back\nthe price line; and, investing heavily in infrastructure projects are at the top of our agenda.\n\nThe BJP believes that after five years of drift and missed opportunities, the time has come\nfor a Government that works, a Government that cares. Our primary concern will be India\u2019s\nrapid, inclusive, equitable and all-embracing development and stable growth that benefits the\nlargest number of people. We will invest in rural development; we will ensure higher agricultural\nproductivity and guarantee an assured income to farmers; and, we will protect the livelihood of\nthe masses while creating myriad opportunities of gainful employment.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\n10\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY\nFEAR SHALL NO LONGER STALK THIS LAND\n\nhe last five years have been a nightmare for the people of this country as terrorists, separatists\n\nand insurgents have led the effete UPA Government on a macabre dance of death and\ndestruction. From the daring attack on Delhi on the eve of Diwali in 2005 to the fidayeen raid\non the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, from the horrendous bombings in Hyderabad (including at\nMecca Masjid), Bangalore, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Guwahati to the slaughter of worshippers\nat Sankat Mochan Temple in Banaras, the terrorists have struck repeatedly with impunity as\nthe Prime Minister spent sleepless nights agonising over the plight of terror suspects and eagerly\noffered to reward the kith and kin of terrorists killed in action.\n\nThe UPA began its tenure by dismantling the anti-terror regime put together by the BJP-\nled NDA Government: The Prevention of Terrorism Act was scrapped; investigations were\nhalted; and, prosecution was slowed down. The mastermind behind the daring attack on\nParliament House, Mohammed Afzal Guru, was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court\nafter being prosecuted under POTA. But a dissolute Government headed by an irresolute Prime\nMinister has failed to carry out the execution, sending out a clear message to India\u2019s enemies:\nThey shall not be punished till such time the Congress is in power.\n\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that terrorists should have repeatedly attacked our cities,\nleaving behind a bloody trail of death and destruction. Delhi, the nation\u2019s capital, and Mumbai,\nthe country\u2019s financial capital, have been hit twice, as has been Bangalore, India\u2019s technology\ncapital. As if the bombings of the commuter trains were not enough, the ISI despatched fidayeen\nfor a multiple strike on Mumbai which began on November 26, 2008, and lasted for more than\n60 hours. Never before has India been seen to be so helpless in the face of terror.\n\nTerrorism sponsored by Pakistani agencies is only one of the reasons behind the fear that\ngrips the people in cities, towns and villages. The life and limb of the \u2018aam admi\u2019 is equally in\ndanger on account of Maoists who have expanded their theatre of violence to 156 districts\nacross 13 States. The inter-State coordination mechanism put in place by the NDA Government\nhas been dismantled and State Governments have been virtually left to fend for themselves in\nthe face of mounting Maoist hostility. In Jammu & Kashmir, separatists continue to use the\nservices of Pakistani terrorists to promote their agenda of relentless violence. In the North-East,\ninsurgents have remorselessly killed and maimed innocent people. The situation in Assam is\nparticularly of concern as the ULFA, which had been all but smashed during the NDA years,\nhas regrouped and rearmed its cadres, and unleashed a relentless wave of terror. The Congress\nState Government has done nothing to either prevent this violence or punish ULFA; instead,\nunconditional talks have been offered to the killers!\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nInternal security is also imperilled by unchecked illegal immigration across our eastern\nborder. The vulnerability of these illegal immigrants has been time and again exploited by the\nISI and its jihadi front organisations as well as local terror cells to carry out bombings and\nprovide logistical support to foreign terrorists. The Supreme Court has described illegal\nimmigration as an act of \u2018external aggression\u2019 while striking down the IMDT Act. But the\nCongress, both at the Centre and in Assam, has tried to circumvent the Supreme Court\u2019s\njudgement through executive orders. The Gauhati High Court last year lashed out at the State\nGovernment for doing nothing to stop the illegal immigration. The High Court highlighted how\na Pakistani, who had entered Assam via Bangladesh, contested Assembly elections unchallenged.\nVote-bank politics has not only changed the demography of vast stretches of eastern and North-\nEast India but also eroded the authority of the state. India is sitting on a tinderbox. The\nconsequences of this unabated illegal immigration are bound to be disastrous.\n\nIn its dying days, the UPA Government has tried to fool the people by tampering with\noutdated laws and setting up a National Investigating Agency to fight terror. But such half-\nhearted efforts to calm anger and disquiet following the 26/11 outrage are neither enough nor\nthe right approach to tacking the menace of terrorism.\n\nThe BJP will initiate the following measures within 100 days of coming to power:\n\n1. Revive the anti-terror mechanism that has been dismantled by the Congress; improve\nupon POTA to ensure it is more effective as an instrument of deterrence and a tool to\nprosecute offenders without innocent people being harassed; and, strengthen the\noperational role of the National Investigating Agency.\n\n2. Give assent to laws drafted by State Governments for dealing with organised crime and\nterrorism; encourage other State Governments to adopt similar laws.\n\n3. Launch a massive programme to detect, detain and deport illegal immigrants.\n\n4. Completely revamp the internal and external intelligence agencies and review the existing\nsystem of coordination, convergence and dissemination of intelligence inputs. A massive\nexercise will be undertaken to modernise intelligence agencies so that they are better\nequipped to use technology and cope with the rapidly changing trends and patterns of\nterrorism at home and abroad. The National Security Council will be made the hub of all\nsector-related assessments. It will be accountable for real-time intelligence dissemination;\nintelligence agencies will be held responsible for lapses. Appointments to intelligence\nagencies will be on merit and not because of political patronage as has been the system\nduring the Congress years.\n\n5. A Digital Security Agency will be set up to deal with cyber warfare, cyber counter-\nterrorism, and cyber security of national digital assets.\n\n6. State Governments will be provided with all assistance to modernise their respective\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\na1\n\f\n12\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\n12.\n\n\u2014O =\n\npolice forces and equip them with the latest weaponry and communications technology.\nThis will be done on a mission mode approach. The police are the first responders to any\ncrisis situation. Drawing lessons from experience, police forces will be trained and fully\nequipped to deal with situations similar to that of Mumbai and in meeting the challenge\nposed by Maoists and insurgents.\n\nBorder management will be reviewed and improved. Punitive measures will be introduced\nto block illegal immigration.\n\nIndia\u2019s vast coastline is virtually unprotected. Coastal security will be strengthened for\nbetter patrolling of Indian waters and preventing terrorists from taking the sea route to\nenter India. A National Maritime Authority will be set up to coordinate coastal security.\n\nSpecial courts will be set up for speedy prosecution of those involved with acts of terrorism.\nTheir trial shall be fair and justice will be done to the victims swiftly.\n\nCoercive measures, including diplomacy, will be used to deal with countries which\npromote cross-border terrorism. India will engage with the world in the global war on\nterror while not compromising on its domestic interests, primarily protecting citizens\nfrom the ravages of terrorism.\n\nThe Centre will facilitate better inter-State coordination and real-time intelligence-sharing,\napart from helping States to raise anti-insurgency forces, to face the threat posed by\nMaoists. The \u2018Chhattisgarh Model\u2019 will be used for counter-Maoist operations. At the\nsame time, every effort will be made to address the social and economic issues that make\nthe ground fertile for Left-wing extremism.\n\nAny talks with insurgent groups will be conditional and within the framework of the\nConstitution.\n\nThe BJP will send out a simple message, loud and clear, to terrorists and their sponsors:\n\nThey will have to pay a heavy price for each innocent life lost. Retribution will be swift and\n\nexemplary. The authority of the state, which has been diminished by the Congress in pursuit of\n\nvote-bank politics, shall be restored.\n\nNational Identity Cards for All\n\nThe BJP will launch an innovative programme to establish a countrywide system of\n\nmultipurpose national identity cards so as to ensure national security, correct welfare delivery,\n\naccurate tax collection, financial inclusion and voter registration. Voter identity cards, PAN\n\ncards, passports, ration cards and BPL cards are already in use though not all with photo\n\nidentity. The NDA proposes to make it incumbent for every Indian to have a National Identity\nCard. The programme will be completed in three years.\n\nThe National Identity Card will contain enough memory and processing capabilities to\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nrun multiple applications. Through it the NDA will ensure efficient welfare delivery and tax\ncollection. The card will also be linked to a bank account. All welfare payments, including\nwidow and old age pensions, through the wide range of schemes such as Mother and Child\nsupport/ Kisan Credit, Students Assistance and Micro-Credit will be channelised through the\nNational Identity Card. The card will make it possible for individuals to save and borrow money;\nfor farmers to get bank credit, also establish accurate land titles data.\n\nThe National Identity Card will also strengthen national security by ensuring accurate\ncitizen identity, thus tracking illegal immigration. All financial transactions, purchase of property\nand access to public services will be possible only on the basis of the National Identity Card\nwhich will be made forgery and hacking resistant.\n\nENGAGING THE WORLD\nINDIA\u2019S VOICE SHALL BE HEARD\n\nhe BJP believes a resurgent India must get its rightful place in the comity of nations and\n\ninternational institutions. The BJP also believes in a multi-polar world with no nation having\noverriding powers over others. Towards this end, the BJP in power will engage in meaningful\ndiplomacy with nations across the world on equal terms. The BJP\u2019s foreign policy will be based\non the principle of enlightened self-interest.\n\nThe BJP desires good relations between India and the USA and will strengthen the India-\nUS strategic partnership on the principle of equality. But we will not compromise on either\nIndia\u2019s national interest or relations with another friendly country. The BJP will restore the\nbalance that has been disturbed by the UPA Government.\n\nIndia\u2019s traditional relations with Russia and the Central Asian Republics will be\nrefashioned to keep pace with current realities and derive maximum mutual advantage.\n\nWe will pursue friendly relations with the European Union, West Asian countries and\nSouth-East Asian nations. It will further strengthen relations with Arab countries and pursue\nenhanced cooperation with Israel - the two are not inter-linked and both are beneficial for\nIndia.\n\nThe dialogue process of solving the outstanding border dispute with China, which was\ninitiated by the NDA Government under Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s leadership, will be revived.\nWe believe that both India and China can prosper and rise together; increased economic\ncooperation can contribute to this.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n13\n\f\n14\n\n\u2014O =\n\nIndia has a special role to play in the Indian Ocean region and we will pursue this\nvigorously.\n\nThe BJP believes in forging enduring friendly and cooperative relations with India\u2019s\nneighbours. We also believe that political stability, progress and peace in India\u2019s neighbourhood\nare essential for South Asia\u2019s growth and development: SAARC is a good platform to promote\nthese goals.\n\nBut the BJP will be guided solely by national interest while dealing with India\u2019s neighbours.\nTowards this end, its decisions and actions in power will be determined by the following:\n\nPakistan: There can be no \u2018comprehensive dialogue\u2019 for peace unless Pakistan a)\ndismantles the terrorist infrastructure on territory under its control; b) actively engages in\nprosecuting terror elements and organisations; c) puts a permanent, verifiable end to its practice\nof using cross-border terrorism as an instrument of state policy; d) stops using the territory of\nthird countries to launch terror attacks on India; and, e) hands over to India individuals wanted\nfor committing crimes on Indian soil.\n\nNepal: The BJP will re-craft India\u2019s Nepal policy to rid it of the UPA\u2019s biases that have\ninfluenced India\u2019s response to events in Nepal with which our country shares a common\ncivilisational and cultural history. India-Nepal relations must be based on friendship, mutual\ncooperation and harmony of interests. Towards this end, existing arrangements will be reviewed\nand revised bearing in mind mutual interests and benefits on the basis of dialogue. The BJP\nwould like to see Nepal emerge as a stable, prosperous country, and will strive to strengthen\nage-old fraternal ties.\n\nBhutan: Existing close relations with Bhutan will be strengthened.\n\nBangladesh: The BJP will pro-actively engage the Government of Bangladesh on issues\nof mutual assistance and benefit. A friendly Government in Dhaka is in India\u2019s interest.\n\nSri Lanka: The BJP believes that Sri Lanka has the right to deal with terrorism on its soil.\nAt the same time, the political, economic and human rights of Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil minority\ncommunity must be protected by the Government in Colombo. The BJP will pursue a robust\nrelationship with Sri Lanka and regain the initiative that has been lost during the last five years.\n\nAfghanistan: The BJP believes that India has an important role in helping the people of\nAfghanistan to rebuild their country and stabilise their society, as well as secure their lives from\nthe depredations of the Taliban operating from Pakistani sanctuaries. The BJP will further build\nupon India-Afghanistan relations and work in close association with the international\ncommunity to ensure a stable, secure and prosperous Afghanistan.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nMother India\u2019s Children Abroad\n\nThe BJP will maintain close contacts with people of Indian origin who have settled on\nforeign shores. It has been the consistent policy of the BJP to promote the interests of people of\nIndian origin living abroad. During the NDA years, special efforts were made to revive and\nrevitalise the ties between Pravasi Bharatiyas and their ancestral land by institutionalising the\nPravasi Bharatiya Divas, honouring achievers and introducing the PIO card. Those efforts will\nbe given a further boost.\n\nDEFENDING INDIA\nNO COMPROMISE, NO CONCESSION\n\nhe Indian Army, Air Force and Navy need to be strengthened in view of rapidly changing\n\nregional and global realities. Tragically, the services have been ignored by the Congress and\nfailure to address the concerns of the Army, Air Force and Navy has bred undesirable discontent.\nThe BJP will address all pending issues immediately. It will be guided by the following solemn\ncommitments while dealing with the defence of India:\n\n1. The long-pending acquisition of military hardware will be expedited through absolutely\ntransparent means in a time-bound manner.\n\n2. Budget allocations for defence forces will be spent without being allowed to lapse. The\ncriminal negligence of the defence forces by the UPA Government has resulted in nearly\nRs 24,000 crore by way of budgetary allocations being allowed to lapse over five years.\nThis not only endangers the lives of our soldiers but also the security of the nation.\n\n3. Our forces are performing a service to the nation and deserve better pay and privileges.\nTowards this end, the BJP is committed to the following measures:\n\na. The pending issues of pay and privileges will be revisited and resolved to the\nsatisfaction of the defence forces. The modalities for setting up a separate Pay\nCommission for the forces will be expedited;\n\nb. All personnel of the Army, Air Force and Navy, as also paramilitary forces, will\nbe exempt from paying income tax on their salaries and perquisites;\n\nc. The honorarium for winners of gallantry awards like Pram Vir Chakra, which is\nabysmally low at Rs 500 to Rs 3,000, will be increased ten-fold to Rs 5,000 to Rs\n30,000. This will be done with retrospective effect; the honorarium will be taxfree.\n\nd. The principle of one rank, one pension will be implemented;\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n15\n\f\n16\n\ne. Incentive-based steps will be taken to make joining the defence services an exciting\nproposition for young men and women to overcome the shortage of officers; and,\n\nf. Incentives will be offered to State Governments for ensuring honourable settlement\nof retired personnel of the defence services.\n\n4. The present shortage of defence personnel at all levels will be met by making the Services\nan attractive career option. This would include competitive pay and privileges, and\npension benefits. This task will be completed in a time-bound manner.\n\n5. The capacities of Defence Research and Development Organisation will be enhanced.\nThe PPP route will be explored for conventional defence production bearing in mind the\nnation\u2019s needs and to make India a competitive player in the global market by 2020.\n\nINDEPENDENT STRATEGIC NUCLEAR PROGRAMME\nWE WILL ASSERT INDIA\u2019S SOVEREIGNTY\n\nhe BJP believes that India\u2019s strategic nuclear programme has been deeply compromised by\n\nthe Congress. The gains of Pokhran-II and subsequent development have been frittered\naway for gains that have accrued to those who wish to see India\u2019s nuclear programme to be\ncontained, rolled back and eventually dismantled.\n\nThe BJP will reverse this drift. India\u2019s indigenous thorium technology programme will be\nexpedited and given all financial assistance, correcting the grievous wrong done by the UPA\nGovernment. India needs nuclear energy, but not at the cost of our national strategic interests.\nThe Congress has fooled the people of India by selling the over-hyped India-US Civil Nuclear\nCooperation Agreement as an absolute necessity and how it will help light up people\u2019s homes.\nIt has done so by suppressing two crucial facts. First, as the CAG has pointed out, the UPA\nGovernment did not make the smallest effort to tap India\u2019s own nuclear fuel supplies. Had it\ndone so, our reactors would have produced many times more power than at present. Second,\nnuclear power is tremendously expensive and not affordable for the \u2018aam admi\u2019. The India-US\nnuclear deal, in the final analysis, is not about empowering India but disempowering India by\nmaking us dependent on American supplies and tying us to discriminatory regimes from which\nPakistan is free.\n\nThe BJP will honour India\u2019s commitments to prevent proliferation. But it will pursue an\nindependent nuclear policy based on the following:\n\n1. All options will be kept open and all steps will be taken that are necessary for the\ntechnological advancement of India\u2019s civil and military nuclear programmes.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\n2. Maintain a credible minimum deterrent that is in tune with changing realities.\n\n3. Seek cross-party consensus before agreeing to any control regime, including CTBT,\nFMCR and MTCR.\n\nIn view of the uncalled for and regrettable secrecy with which the Congress and the\nPrime Minister dealt with the India-US nuclear deal, the BJP proposes to introduce an amendment\nto the Constitution to make it mandatory for Government to seek Parliament\u2019s approval/\nratification by two-thirds majority before signing any bilateral or multilateral agreement that\nimpinges on India\u2019s strategic programmes, territorial integrity and economic interest.\n\nFOOD SECURITY\nWE WILL MAKE INDIA HUNGER-FREE\n\nhe BJP views food security as integral to national security. The spectre of a looming food\ncrisis haunts the developing world as never before. With the agriculture sector suffering on\naccount of the Congress\u2019 gross negligence, India faces a real threat of food scarcity.\n\nWith India becoming a net importer of food under Congress rule, there is genuine concern\nabout food security. Three factors have contributed to increasing food scarcity and the resultant\nsense of growing insecurity among the masses. First, the real income of workers and farmers\nhas not kept pace with the rising cost of food, thus reducing their purchasing power. Second,\nthe public distribution system has been severely crippled by the Congress-led Government which\nhas been more interested in importing food grains and selling them at a high price than in\nsecuring the needs of the people. Third, with an additional 55 million people pushed below the\npoverty line over the last five years, there is widespread malnourishment. The economic recession\nhas only worsened the situation and made it grimmer, especially for workers in the unorganised\nsector.\n\nThe BJP believes people have the right to food. To ensure food security for all and eliminate\nhunger, we will:\n\n1. Provide 35 kg of rice or wheat every month to BPL families at Rs 2 per kg under an\nimproved and expanded Antyodaya Anna Yojana. This will be available against \u2018Food\nCoupons\u2019 redeemable at both PDS and private outlets.\n\n2. Allocate more funds for expanding, universalising and improving the functioning of the\nPublic Distribution System.\n\n3. Preventing families from slipping below the poverty line.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n17\n\f\n18\n\n\u2014O =\n\n4. Setting up community kitchens in extremely impoverished areas with the help of NGOs\nthrough shared funding.\n\n5. Aggressively addressing the problem of widespread malnutrition, especially by expanding\nthe scope of the existing mid-day meal scheme.\n\n6. Encouraging the production of cereals and discouraging the conversion of fertile farm\nland for dubious industrial projects.\n\n7. Ensuring a sufficient level of food stocks are maintained to meet any exigencies due to\npossible global food crisis which could be severely debilitating and make imports\nprohibitively expensive, if not impossible.\n\nENERGY SECURITY\nWE WILL PROTECT INDIA FROM FUTURE CRISES\n\nTT cannot afford to lose any more time on securing its energy requirements. The Congress\u2019s\nresponse to this issue has been episodic at best, often resulting in India failing to secure its\nenergy interests even as other countries in the neighbourhood, most notably China, have spared\nno effort to single-mindedly pursue the goal of securing their energy needs for the present and\nfuture.\n\nAt present India is largely dependent on imported oil and gas to meet its energy demands,\nespecially demand for power although our per capita power consumption is only a sixth of the\nworld average. Sixty-seven per cent of our power supply comes from fossil fuels, of which 70\nper cent is imported. With market fluctuation and manipulation, as it happened in 2008, this\nmakes us vulnerable to external factors.\n\nThe BJP proposes to invest heavily in developing non-fossil fuel-based clean energy sources,\nespecially for electricity production. Our goal will be to add at least 120,000 MW of power over\nthe next five years, with 20 per cent of it coming from renewable sources. Similar emphasis will\nbe placed on developing alternatives to petrol and diesel to lessen the burden of imported oil\nand gas as well as meet the challenges of climate change.\n\nAdequate support will be extended for developing hybrid technologies and their\napplications. There will be special emphasis on developing renewal energy sources, especially\nsolar energy, wind energy and run-on-the-river technology, and bio-fuel. Innovation will be\nrewarded.\n\nImpetus will be provided for the production of non-conventional energy by enabling\npeople and firms to bank it in the power grid and draw it at the time of their need.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nREVIVING THE NATIONAL ECONOMY\nFROM RECESSION TO JOB-GENERATING GROWTH\n\nhe UPA Government's mismanagement of the national economy and fiscal indiscipline has\n\nresulted in frittering away the tremendous gains of the NDA years. The slowing down of\n\nIndia\u2019s growth has had an adverse impact on people across the country. To control inflation,\nthe UPA Government drained liquidity out of the system, which, in turn, hobbled both the\norganised and unorganised sectors. It is now desperately trying to reverse that flawed policy,\n\nbut clearly such half-hearted measures are not sufficient. The situation calls for determined,\ndirect and visible Government intervention. The BJP plans to do so through robust policies\n\naimed at revitalising the economy and placing India on the path of employment-generating\n\ngrowth coupled with rapid development.\n\nTowards this end, the BJP will take the following measures:\n\n1.\n\nPut in place a low tax, low interest regime so that people have more money and their\npurchasing power increases, which in turn will serve as an impetus for the economy.\n\nExempt income up to Rs 3 lakh from Income Tax. Women and senior citizens will receive\nan additional exemption benefit of Rs 50,000.\n\nIncome of all senior citizens by way of pension will be exempt from Income Tax.\n\nTo incentivise savings, all interest earned on bank deposits other than by corporates and\nthose who have business income shall be exempt from tax.\n\nDispense with clubbing of agricultural income with other sources of income for\ndetermining tax liability on other income.\n\nCST will be abolished and GST will be rationalised between 12 and 14 per; FBT will go.\nESOPS and MAT tax regime will be rationalised and made equitable.\n\nFirm action will be initiated to minimise the presence of black money in the national\neconomy. We will take determined steps to bring back the money (estimated at Rs\n25,00,000 crore and Rs 75,00,000 crore) illegally stashed in Swiss bank accounts and tax\nhavens, and use it for infrastructure development, housing, health and social welfare\nschemes.\n\nArrest the loss of jobs and reverse the trend of joblessness which is far worse than\nunemployment by making massive public sector investments in job-generating\ninfrastructure programmes, especially building of roads and highways, and linking of\nrivers.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n19\n\f\n20\n\n10.\n\n11.\n12.\n\n13.\n\n14.\n\n15.\n16.\n\n\u2014O =\n\nHindustan Diamond Corporation will be provided full support to help the diamond\nindustry tide over the crisis caused by the global economic slump. It will provide raw\ndiamonds to the cutting and polishing units and bank them for future trade.\n\nHighways construction, which got a boost during the NDA years, will once again feature\nhigh on Government's agenda. We will build between 15 and 20 km of highways every\nday.\n\nThe Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, the largest rural connectivity programme\ninitiated by the NDA Government, will be fully implemented in the first three years.\n\nBring down interest rates for housing loans so that housing becomes affordable, accessible\nand revives the stalled real estate sector which has witnessed huge job losses.\n\nEnhance the capabilities of the manufacturing sector by easing credit availability.\n\nPromote SMEs and the retail sector which can generate a large number of jobs and make\na meaningful contribution to the national economy.

Apart from assisting State Governments to renew and\n\nrevive existing cities and replace festering slums with hygienic, affordable living quarters, the\nBJP will review and recast the Urban Development Policy. We will specifically do the following,\n\nbearing in mind the challenges of the future:\n\n1.\n\nIn pursuit of the principle of \u2018Shelter for All\u2019, 10 lakh dwelling units for the poor will be\nconstructed every year.\n\nFifteen new cities, with world class infrastructure facilities and amenities, will be built in\nfive years.\n\nFor existing urban centres, basic infrastructure facilities and amenities of water, drainage,\nroads, electricity, environment and solid waste management will be enhanced for a clean\nand healthy city life.\n\nPeripheral areas of cities will be developed on the basis of \u2018rurban\u2019 concept to minimise\nmigration: The physical infrastructure facilities will be that of urban areas but the heart\nand soul will be of rural areas.\n\nGIS-based mapping of urban properties and title certification will be concluded.\n\nPractical, pragmatic measures will be adopted to deal with emerging urban problems\nlike vehicular traffic overload.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n21\n\f\n\u2014O =\n\nAGRICULTURE\nDEBT-FREE FARMER, PROSPEROUS INDIA\n\nhe pitiful state of our farm sector is best exemplified by debt-ridden farmers committing\n\nsuicide. The UPA Government, while actively promoting the import of food grains, has\ncallously ignored the plight of India\u2019s farmers. There are three immediate concerns which will\nbe addressed by the BJP in a time-bound manner: Ensuring assured income for farmers; freeing\nfarmers from the burden of mounting debts; and, increasing public investment in agriculture.\nEverything can wait, but not agriculture.\n\nTo make India\u2019s farmer debt-free, the BJP will:\n1. Waive agricultural loans.\n\n2. Set up a commission to study the entire gamut of farmers\u2019 loans and come up with an\nactionable solution to the deepening crisis within six months.\n\n3. Set a maximum ceiling of 4 per cent interest for agricultural loans to farmers from banks.\n4. Introduce a pension scheme for aged and helpless farmers.\n\n5. Make agriculture profitable by reducing the cost of inputs, enhancing yields and reviewing\nthe present method of determining prices.\n\n6. Implement a Farm Income Insurance Scheme through which both price and produce\nwill be insured. In the event of loss of crops, farmers will be compensated under this\nscheme so that they do not suffer any loss of income.\n\n7. Promote nature-friendly cultivation and incentivise organic farming to arrest soil quality\ndepletion. Special marketing assistance for organic produce.\n\n8. Introduce value addition schemes to reduce wastage and invest in food-processing units\nwhich will generate jobs for rural youth.\n\n9. Create irrigation facilities for an additional 35 million hectares of land in five years: This\nwill generate rural jobs as well as benefit farmers. Drip irrigation will be promoted along\nwith better water management and use of check dams.\n\n10. Ensure quality power, seeds and other inputs.\n\n11. Heavily invest funds in agriculture to reverse the trend set by the Congress-led UPA and\nmake the farm sector an equal engine of growth along with industry and the services\nsector.\n\n12. Strengthen National Rural Bank and allied services.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\n~S\n13. Promote horticulture, floriculture, pisciculture and poultry for generating additional jobs\nand supplementing incomes.\n\n14. Create additional grazing land and encourage the maintenance of ponds and water\nbodies.\n\nGM Seeds\n\nNo genetically modified seed will be allowed for cultivation without full scientific data\non long-term effects on soil, production and biological impact on consumers. All food and food\nproducts produced with genetically modified seeds will be branded as \u2018GM Food\u2019.\n\nLAND ACQUISITION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE\nFARMERS INTERESTS WILL BE PROTECTED\n\nhe Central and State Governments, for long, have acquired land, through an opaque process,\n\nto hand it over to private parties under the umbrella of \u2018public purpose\u2019. The UPA\nGovernment has approved 572 Special Economic Zones that cover 50,000 acres, three times the\nsize of Singapore. This is clearly absurd and spells disaster for the farm sector.\n\nThe BJP will adopt a National Land Use Policy which will protect the interests of farmers.\nIts implementation will be monitored by a National Land Use Authority which will work with\nState Land Use Authorities to regulate and facilitate land management. The powers and functions\nof the National Land Use Authority will be similar to those of other regulatory bodies.\n\nThe BJP will bring about amendments to existing laws to rectify anomalies pertaining to\nland acquisition. Farmers will be compensated at market rates for any land acquired for\ninfrastructure purposes. The BJP will not allow the conversion of fertile farmland for industrial/\ncommercial projects or Special Economic Zones.\n\nThe entire issue of Special Economic Zones and acquisition of land for industrial use will\nbe addressed after a careful scrutiny of the Parliamentary Standing Committee\u2019s report and\nfactoring in the need to protect the farm sector and enhance food production.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n23\n\f\n24\n\n\u2014O =\n\nInternational Trade Agreements\n\nThe BJP shall fight against the protectionist trend which is emerging in some developed\ncountries. We will safeguard the country\u2019s interests in all bilateral and multilateral trade agree-\nments by avoiding to accept any new unilateral or less than reciprocal commitments. Our Gov-\nernment will renegotiate all such past commitments that are inconsistent with national inter-\nests, especially to ensure food security and affordable health care. We will not hesitate to roll\nback any concessions and facilities not reciprocated by the counterparts. The BJP will safeguard\nthe interests of our vast technical manpower and ensure maximum market access in future\nagreements depending upon the offers made by the trade partners.\n\nRetail Trade\n\nThe BJP understands the critical importance of retail trade in the context of employment\nand services provided by them, and thus favours a dominant role for the unincorporated sector\nin retail trade. Towards this end, it will not allow foreign investment in the retail sector. After\nagriculture, the retail sector is the largest employer of nearly four crore people.\n\nWe will:\n1. Adopt all necessary measures to safeguard the interests of small and tiny retail vendors.\n\n2. Ensure availability of working capital needs for such vendors through credit at not more\nthan four per cent interest.\n\n3. Study the feasibility of a slab-based \u2018Compound Tax\u2019 for traders to free them from need-\nless harassment and end corruption.\n\n4. Set up an empowered committee to recommend welfare measures, including a pension\nscheme, for small traders.\n\nLabour\n\nThe BJP will holistically address the long-pending issue of labour reforms, bearing in\nmind the long-term interests of the working class. It will do so through close consultation with\nrepresentative bodies of labour and employers. We are committed to ensure the following:\n\n1. Making secret ballot compulsory for trade union elections, by suitably amending the\nIndustrial Disputes Act.\n\n2. Launching a training programme for trade unions to play an effective and positive role.\n\n3. Setting up a \u2018Workers Bank\u2019 to deal with the banking requirements of labour in the\norganised and unorganised sectors.\n\n4. Ensuring adequate compensation for any labour that may be retrenched, with the first\noption being redeployment.\n\n5. Setting up a National Child Labour Commission.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\n6.\n\nFor labour in the unorganised sector, revise minimum wages; expand safety net.\n\nCooperative Sector\n\nEvery effort will be made to encourage the cooperative sector. Towards this end, the BJP\n\nwill do the following:\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nExempt cooperative banks from paying income tax.\nFrame a model law for cooperative societies for nationwide implementation.\nAmend the Multi-State Cooperative Act to remove current lacunae and anomalies.\n\nSet up a Central regulatory authority for cooperative bodies.\n\nCONSUMER RIGHTS\n\nThe rights of consumers will be further strengthened. The BJP will set up an experts\n\ncommittee to deal with the following issues:\n\n1.\n2.\n\nSetting up of services specific arbitration courts to settle consumer disputes.\n\nCreating a mechanism for whereby consumers can participate in a structured consultative\nprocess with Government.\n\nMaking consumer product labelling more content information specific.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n25\n\f\n26\n\n\u2014O =\n\nYOUTH POWER\nEMPOWERING YOUNG INDIA\n\nndia\u2019s population, unlike that of Western nations, is getting younger by the day. More than\nhalf of our citizens are aged 25 and below; nearly two-thirds are aged 35 and below. The\naspirations and ambitions of the youth are fuelled by rising literacy and awareness levels.\n\nIt is the Government's duty to help them achieve these aspirations and ambitions, and\nmake them capable of taking on all challenges and converting them into opportunities. The BJP\nwill fulfil this duty by framing policies in consonance with the concerns of \u2018Young India\u2019 and\naimed at unleashing the abilities of the youth, who will be the driving force of this nation\u2019s\nemergence as an awesome knowledge power. The BJP\u2019s Manifesto has been drafted keeping the\naspirations and ambitions of the youth in mind.\n\nWe propose to review, revive and re-launch the National Service Scheme and National\nCadet Corps as effective vehicles to involve the youth in nation-building and reinforcing their\nnational spirit. Their participation in the decision-making process and decision-making bodies\nwill be actively encouraged.\n\nThe BJP also proposes to launch a unique \u2018National Knowledge Incubation Programme\u2019.\nThis will involve the setting up of \u2018Incubation Centres\u2019 for meritorious students from all strata of\nsociety. To begin with, at least one per cent of the best brains will be deployed for mentoring at\nthe \u2018Incubation Centres\u2019. Adequate resources will be provided for the programme.\n\nA National Student Bank will be set up to meet the banking requirements, including\nstudy loans, of students, at 4% rate of interest.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nEDUCATION FOR ALL\nLITERATE INDIA, POWERFUL INDIA\n\nhe BJP will give education its due place in governance to achieve social, economic, cultural\n\nand technical advancement. Education will be the Government\u2019s instrument to reduce\npoverty, promote health, protect the environment and advance gender equality.

The\nexamination system will be reviewed for extensive reform.\n\nThe following are the highlights of the BJP\u2019s agenda to ensure education for all:\n\nSchool Education\n1. The success story of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, launched by the NDA in 2002, shall be\nstrengthened, extended and concretised further in quality, content and support systems.\n\n2.

This Commission shall undertake continuous envisioning of\neducational plans, strategies methods, material and research to make India a knowledge power\nand develop several institutions of higher learning and research as centres of international pursuit\nof knowledge and learning.\n\nRagging to be Made a Criminal Offence with Stiff Punishment\n\nThe BJP will frame a law to deal with the menace of ragging. All cases of ragging will be\ntried in fast-track courts. School/college/ university authorities will be held culpable for failing\nto implement the law.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nSCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\nOVER THE MOON AND BEYOND\n\nhe BJP in power will aggressively promote science and technology for the well-being of all\n\ncitizens and India\u2019s progress as well as its emergence as force on the global scene.

This is an essential element of achieving our goal of making India a devel-\noped nation in the sports world within five years. Towards this end, we will:\n\n1. Introduce sports as a compulsory part of school curriculum. Towards this end, sports\ninfrastructure and facilities in schools, colleges and universities will be expanded with\nadequate provision of resources by the Ministry of Human Resource Development and\nState Governments. Rs 5,000 crore will be allocated for the purpose to be released through\nthe UGC, Central Educational Boards / Sangathans and State Governments for speedy\nimplementation of sports and youth development activities.\n\n2.

The Congress had promised to introduce the law for women\u2019s reservation\nin State Assemblies and Parliament. But it had neither the conviction to introduce the legislation\nnor the courage to stand up to its allies who are opposed to the political empowerment of\nwomen. The BJP remains committed to 33 per cent political representation for women, and\nshall act on this after coming to power.\n\nThere are other key areas where the BJP will focus its attention to empower women:\n\n1. Introduce the Ladli Lakshmi Scheme, which has been a big success in Madhya Pradesh,\nat the national level to encourage girls to attend school up to at least pre-college level.\nUnder this scheme, each girl child from disadvantaged families will receive Rs 2,000 on\nreaching Class 6; Rs 4,000 in Class 9; Rs 7,500 in Class 11; and, Rs 1,10,000 on completing\n21 years of age.

Adopt the Bhamashah Vitteeya Sashaktikaran Evam Naari Samriddhi Yojana, conceived\nby the erstwhile BJP Government in Rajasthan, to financially empower women from\nBelow Poverty Line, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes families and those of small\nand marginal farmers. Under this scheme, bank accounts will be opened for the\nbeneficiary women and they alone will be able to operate the accounts through specially\ndesigned smart cards. An initial deposit of Rs 1,500 will be made in the bank accounts.\nThe scheme also envisages job creation through opening of banks in remote areas and\ncounsellors to help the beneficiaries to manage their accounts.\n\n3. A national programme will be launched, in cooperation with State Governments, to\nprovide bicycles to girls from Below Poverty Line Families who attend school.\n\n4.

Support for programmes like \u2018Swavalamban\u2019 and \u2018STEP\u2019 (Support to Training and\nEmployment Programme), which promote self-employment and entrepreneurship for\nwomen through self-help groups, will be greatly enhanced. Technical and management\nservices for those engaged in handicrafts, food-processing, handloom, garments, etc,\nwill be strengthened. Added focus will be provided for implementing these programmes\nin the North-East, Jammu & Kashmir, and areas affected by Maoism.\n\n8. Enterprises promoted by women, or employing a large number of women, will be given\n\u2018fast track\u2019 facilitation. They will get loans at preferential rates of interest.\n\n9. Laws to check female foeticide, dowry, child marriage, trafficking, rape and family\nviolence will be reviewed, strengthened and strictly enforced.

A special programme will be launched,\nin cooperation with State Governments, to ensure full security for women.\n\n10. Programmes aimed at helping indigent women and women in distress will be\nstrengthened with the cooperation of State Governments.\n\n11. Every effort will be made to expand and improve upon the existing network of working\nwomen\u2019s hostels.\n\n12. The current extremely low salaries of Anganwadi workers and helpers, who are the\nbackbone of the Integrated Child Development Scheme, will be doubled.\n\nProtecting Women\u2019s Rights\n\nArticle 44 of the Constitution of India lists Uniform Civil Code as one of the Directive\nPrinciples of State Policy. There cannot be real gender equality till such time India adopts a\nUniform Civil Code which protects the rights of all women. The BJP, as a first step towards this\nconstitutionally mandated direction, will set up a Commission to draft a Uniform Civil Code,\ndrawing upon the best traditions and harmonising them with the modern times. The Commission\nwill also study reforms towards gender equality in other countries, including Islamic countries.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n35\n\f\n36\n\n\u2014O =\n\nDALITS, OBCs & ECONOMICALLY WEAKER SECTIONS OF SOCIETY\nWE WILL ENSURE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND HARMONY\n\nhe BJP is committed to the principle of Social Justice (Samajik Nyay) and Samajik Samarasata\n\n(Social Harmony). Instead of pursuing identity politics which do not fetch benefits to Dalits,\nOBCs and other deprived sections of our society, the BJP will focus on tangible development\nand empowerment.\n\nThe BJP will boost opportunities for entrepreneurship and commerce among Dalits, OBCs\nand other deprived sections of our society so that India\u2019s social diversity is fairly reflected in its\neconomic diversity.\n\nAtrocities against Dalits, Tribals and weaker sections of society will be firmly dealt with.\n\nThe extremely backward communities need urgent Government assistance. Special efforts\nwill be made to reach out to them. In contrast to the UPA years when an additional 55 million\npeople were pushed below the poverty line, the BJP will strive to bring families above the poverty\nline through aggressive policies and targeted programmes.\n\nA mission-mode approach will be adopted for providing the following to deprived communities:\n1. Special educational facilities through Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan.\n2. Water, health, sanitation and hygiene for all families/habitations.\n\nA special component will be created in all development schemes to benefit the deprived\nsections of society. An \u2018Extremely Backward Communities Development Bank\u2019 will be set up for\npromoting skill enhancement through learn-and-earn schemes for their uplift.\n\nThe BJP will introduce education and job quotas on the basis of economic criteria for all\neconomically weaker sections of society other than Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and\nOBCs, who will continue to enjoy quota benefits.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nTRIBAL DEVELOPMENT\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR LASTING WELFARE\n\nt is a proven fact that incremental and piecemeal attempts for the development of tribals\n\nhave not helped. Hence, the BJP will adopt a comprehensive, all-encompassing long-term\n\nstrategy to empower tribals and ensure their welfare. We will draw upon the experience of our\nGovernments in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh which have successfully\n\nimplemented tribal welfare and development schemes.\n\nWe will initiate a \u2018Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana\u2019 at the national level, to be overseen by a\n\n\u2018Tribal Development Authority\u2019. This scheme will focus on:\n\n1.\n\nSetting up new schools and colleges, as also engineering colleges, polytechnics, agri-\nengineering colleges, nursing schools, veterinary schools.\n\nUpgrading housing, water and health facilities.\nElectrification of tribal hamlets and provision of all-weather roads.\n\nInitiating new economic activities related to agriculture and agri-processing,\nhorticulture, etc.\n\nPromoting dairy-based activities.\n\nCreating employment opportunities by promoting bamboo-processing units and small-\nscale units.\n\nPreventing tribal land from being alienated.\nFacilitating access to minor forest produce and creating a network of rural markets.\n\nEstablishing a National Research Centre for the preservation of tribal culture and\nlanguages.\n\n10. Providing adequate funds for tribal welfare and development.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009 37\n\f\n\u2014O =\n\nSENIOR CITIZENS\nCARE AND RESPECT FOR THE ELDERLY\n\nhe elderly deserve full support of both Government and society. The BJP is committed to the\nwelfare of senior citizens. A separate department will be created in the Social Welfare\nMinistry to deal with senior citizens\u2019 issues. We will:\n\n1. Review pensions and pension policies to ensure benefits keep pace with the actual cost\nof living.\n\n2. Study the feasibility of introducing higher interest rates on savings for all citizens above\n60 years of age.\n\n3. Rationalise travel concessions.\n4. Introduce a health insurance policy that does not discriminate against the elderly.\n\n5. Income tax benefits for senior citizens will be made available at 60 years, instead of 65\nyears as is the practice at present.\n\n6. Review existing provisions of old age pension scheme and expand its application.\n\nCARE OF THE DISABLED\nINTEGRATING THE DIFFERENTLY ABLED\n\nDe people constitute five per cent of India\u2019s population. Years of neglect has delayed\ntheir integration into the social mainstream. Their welfare and rehabilitation is integral to\nNDA\u2019s vision of a caring society and a responsive government. The BJP will:\n\n1. Ensure and implement the right for education and vocational training for the disabled.\n2. Ensure disabled-friendly access to public utilities, public buildings, and transport.\n\n3. Ensure maximum economic independence of the disabled by creating more income\ngeneration models for the disabled.\n\n4. Facilitate establishment of an Institute of Vocational Training for the Disabled in every\ndistrict with public-private partnership.\n\n5. Provide special incentive for the adoption of a disabled child.\n\n6. Support voluntary organizations working for the care of the disabled.\n\n \n\n38 BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\n=\n\nMINORITY COMMUNITIES\nHEALTHY DIET OF DEVELOPMENT\n\nhe BJP repudiates the division of Indian society along communal lines which has been\n\nfostered by the Congress and the Left in pursuit of their vote-bank politics. Categorisation\nof communities as \u2018minorities\u2019 perpetuates notions of imagined discrimination and victimhood;\nit reinforces the perception of the \u2018minority\u2019 identity as separate from the national identity. The\nBJP remains committed to a common Indian identity that transcends community, caste and\ngender, with every Indian an equal participant in the building of a prosperous nation and an\nequal beneficiary of that prosperity. Pluralism is a sine qua non for any democracy and the BJP\ncherishes the diversity that is also the strength of Indian society and lends vibrancy to our\nnational fabric. But pluralism should strengthen, not weaken our national resolve.\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact that Muslims form a substantial part of the underprivileged. The\nprincipal reason for this is the fact that the Congress, a dominant presence in power for six\ndecades, has secured minority support through the politics of fear rather than a healthy diet of\ndevelopment.\n\nThe BJP will implement a set of policies committed to a massive expansion of modern\neducation among Muslims, particularly for the girl child, through a new nationwide network of\nschools, in a public-private partnership programme. This will include, but not be limited to:\n\n1. Capital assistance in new educational projects, both for basic and technical education,\nin low-income minority areas. Each project will be vetted for viability by a team of\nprofessionals within a maximum of six months.\n\n2. Cash incentives for the education of the girl child, based on attendance and\nperformance. Incentives will rise for those girls who get admission into recognised\ncolleges for higher education.\n\n3. Computer centres will be set up in low income urban areas and the most backward\ndistricts of the country.\n\n4. The Ministry of Minority Affairs, today a stagnant source of toxic politics, will be\nrevitalised into a hub for economic projects specifically targeted towards employment\ncreation. There will be special emphasis on crafts and small-scale industries that\nhave been traditional employers of minorities. The neglect of the Congress-led UPA\nGovernment was evident in the fact that even monies allotted for minority welfare\nprogrammes in States like Maharashtra were largely, if not wholly, unspent.\n\n5. Youth are the owners of the future, and it is our duty to make them a dynamic social\nand economic engine for upliftment. The young do not live only in cities. In districts\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n39\n\f\n40\n\n\u2014O =\n\nlike Murshidabad in Bengal, young girls are being forced by poverty into making\nbidis on pathetic wages. Dynamic intervention is needed to improve income levels\nwhere such jobs exist and to create fresh avenues of employment where they do not.\nThe unfortunate phase of confused loyalties in some minority sections is over.\nGenerations have been born in free India who are as committed to the nation as the\nnation is committed to them. The success stories of Muslims in sports, cinema, industry\nand a host of other fields, as individuals and team players, makes every Indian proud.\n\n6. Terrorism does not havea religion. Those who espouse terrorism have stepped outside\nthe moral code of their religion into barbarism. We must lift community-relations\nfrom the morass of misunderstanding.\n\nA vibrant, modern India can have no place for either the perpetrators or the exploiters of fear.\n\nReligious Conversions\n\nThe BJP will facilitate, under the auspices of noted religious leaders, the setting up of a\npermanent inter-faith consultative mechanism to promote harmony among and trust between\ncommunities. This mechanism will also be used for a sustained and sincere Inter-Faith Dialogue\nbetween leaders of the Hindu and Christian communities on all aspects of life, including the\nissue of religious conversions. The dialogue should be held in the spirit of the unanimous report\nof the Inter-Faith Dialogue on Conversions, which was organised at the Vatican in May 2006 by\nthe Pontifical Council for Inter-Faith Dialogue and the World Council of Churches, Geneva.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nHEALTH FOR ALL\nINDIA\u2019S WEALTH, PEOPLE\u2019S HEALTH\n\nAS to quality and affordable healthcare remains a dream for a vast majority of our\npeople. This is truly ironical because India is rapidly emerging as a global destination for\nmedical care for foreigners.\n\nThe BJP will launch a massive programme, through public-private participation, to\nintroduce a \u2018Health for All\u2019 scheme based on an innovative insurance policy. Under this scheme,\nthe premium of BPL families will be paid by Government. Beneficiaries will have access to\nGovernment and private hospitals for cashless treatment.\n\nWe will make the \u2018108\u2019 telephone service - for medical emergencies - universally accessible\nthroughout India in 12 months.\n\nOne of our main targets will be to eradicate the curse of malnutrition. We will do so by\nrevamping existing programmes and launching a multi-pronged war against malnutrition across\nthe nation, especially in the under-developed areas, with the help of State Governments. All\nresources will be provided to achieve this goal.\n\nThe BJP will also initiate action on the following:\n\n1. Set up a National Regulatory Authority for private hospitals, nursing homes and special\ncare facilities to ensure quality services, affordable fees and prevent/ punish malpractice.\nWhile private sector participation in health care is welcome, it cannot become a source\nof unrestricted and unrestrained profit-making at the expense of the people.\n\n2. Ongoing work on setting up six additional All-India Institutes of Medical Sciences in\nvarious parts of the country, which were proposed by the NDA Government but not\nacted upon by the UPA, will be expedited. Similar institutions will be set up in other\nplaces to broad-base access to specialised medical care.\n\n3. Incentives and disincentives will be introduced for State Governments to improve the\nquality of primary health care, maternal health care, and child health care.\n\n4. Targets will be set for achieving significant reduction in maternal and infant mortality\nby improving the Janani Suraksha Yojana. The successful initiative of the BJP Government\nin Gujarat in this regard will be used as a model.\n\n5. Preventive health care by way of inoculation against diseases and dissemination of\ninformation will receive focussed attention.\n\n6. A national programme will be launched to vaccinate adults and children against all\nforms of hepatitis.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n41\n\f\n42\n\n7. Substantial investment will be made in promoting Ayurved as an alternative therapy.\nFull support will be extended to the promotion of Unani system of medicine and\nhomoeopathy. The promotion of Yoga will receive all Government assistance.\n\n8. Clean drinking water is one of the best barriers against common but often fatal diseases.\nThe BJP proposes to make access to clean drinking water a fundamental right for all\ncitizens.\n\nPopulation Stabilisation\n\nThe BJP views the people of India as productive assets of society. To maximise their\nproductivity, they have to be provided with access to health, education, technology and skills,\nwhich, in turn, require additional resources. This will be possible if we are able to stabilise\nIndia\u2019s population. Towards this end, the BJP will address three priority issues:\n\n1. Recognition of close linkages between sustainable development and population\nstabilisation.\n\n2. Link population programmes with other development initiatives like health, education,\nnutrition and poverty eradication programmes.\n\n3. Follow a non-coercive and gender sensitive approach for population stabilisation.\n\nONE EARTH, GREEN EARTH\nCREATING THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT\n\nhe BJP will pursue national growth objectives through an ecologically sustainable pathway\n\nthat leads to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. We recognise that containing global\nwarming is essential to protecting life and security of people and environment. Mitigating the\nthreat by building a low carbon economy is the biggest economic opportunity of the 21\"\ncentury.\n\nThe BJP endorses the principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d, as\nenshrined in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. We look at \u2018Climate Change\u2019\nin the context of the promises made by the international community for technology transfer and\nadditional financing since Rio, which have remained unfulfilled. The BJP will actively pursue\nthe transfer of critical technologies that can have a significant impact on reducing carbon\n\nemissions.\nBearing in mind concerns on environment and related climate change issues, the BJP will:\n\n1. Give appropriate importance to containing climate change.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\n10.\n\n11.\n\nLay importance on energy security and sustainable energy pathways by setting clear\ntargets for energy efficiency and renewable energy.\n\nBring about a complete shift in subsidy from chemical fertilisers to rewarding farmers\nfor pursuing conservation and enhancement of local crop varieties, thereby enhancing\nthe conservation of local agro-biodiversity.\n\nOffer attractive support prices and incentives for traditional rain-fed crops and promote\nmarkets for them. This will be coupled with a decentralised Public Distribution System\nthat will mop up excess production of local food and distribute it among those households\nthat are food deficit locally. A decentralised PDS will be more climate smart since it will\neliminate excessive costs of transportation and storage.\n\nRevisit laws for protecting forests and reserve parks to make them more effective in\npreventing encroachment and man-animal conflict. All resources will be provided for\nprotecting forestland and animal reserves; wilful destruction of forests and killing of\nwildlife for profit or pleasure will fetch stringent punishment.\n\nA permanent Task Force will be set up for the protection and preservation of tigers, lions\nand other wild cats. A separate Task Force will look after the protection and preservation\nof elephants. A third Task Force will look after bird sanctuaries. They will be duly\nempowered to take whatever steps are necessary to achieve their goals.\n\nProvide incentives to encourage institutions and individuals to switch over to energy-\nsaving devices and eco-friendly designs for housing and workplace. Full support will be\ngiven for developing low-energy, low-cost technology by both public and private sectors.\nA Group of Experts will be set up to formulate target-driven objectives towards this end.\n\nEncourage citizens\u2019 participation in protecting the environment and curbing pollution.\nSchools will be involved in promoting environment and ecology-related issues among\nchildren.\n\nAdopt a mission-mode approach to clean all rivers.\n\nLaunch a national programme for citizens\u2019 participation in reforestation, agro-forestry\nand social forestry by planting a billion trees every year.\n\nImportance given to programmes to arrest the melting of Himalayan glaciers from which\nmost major rivers in North India originate.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n43\n\f\n44\n\nADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES & CENTRE-STATE RELATIONS\nWE ARE COMMITTED TO GOOD GOVERNANCE\n\nhe BJP will set up a Group of Ministers to study the report of the Administrative Reforms\n\nCommission and submit its recommendations within six months. Given the importance of\nthese reforms to our pursuit of the goal of Good Governance, the BJP proposes to implement\nthem through an appropriate body under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. We will strive to bring\nabout absolute transparency in Government's decision-making process. Corruption at any level\nof Government will be dealt with swiftly.\n\nWe will place Centre-State relations on an even keel through the process of consultation.\nThe genuine grievances of States will be addressed in a comprehensive manner. The moribund\nNational Development Council will be revived and made into an active body.\n\nWhile every effort will be made to meet the development aspirations of the people and\nmake authority accountable to the citizens, no concessions will be made to separatist and insurgent\ngroups.\n\nJammu & Kashmir\n\nJammu & Kashmir was, is and shall remain an integral part of the Union of India. Its\nstatus is non-negotiable and, as successive elections have comprehensively demonstrated, the\npeople of Jammu & Kashmir see themselves as part of the Indian national mainstream.\n\nThe BJP will be guided by the following principles while dealing with issues related to\nJammu & Kashmir:\n\n1. The territorial integrity of India is inviolable. The unanimous Parliamentary Resolution\nof 1994 reiterates this point and shall remain the cornerstone of future decisions and\nactions of our Government.\n\n2. To meet the aspirations of the people of Jammu & Kashmir and ensure rapid progress\nof this State, the BJP will promote an agenda of equal development of its three regions\n\u2014 Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. All support, including financial, will be provided to\nthe State Government for this purpose.\n\n3. The Pandits who had to leave their home and hearth in the Kashmir Valley on account\nof separatist violence and terrorism are fully deserving of all support and assistance,\nwhich will be provided to them in full measure. Their return to the land of their ancestors\nwith full dignity, security and assured livelihood will figure high on the BJP\u2019s agenda.\n\n4. The long-pending problems and demands of refugees from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir\nwill be addressed.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\n5. Article 370 poses a psychological barrier for the full integration of the people of Jammu\n& Kashmir with the national mainstream. The BJP remains committed to the abrogation\nof this Article.\n\nSmall States\n\nThe BJP has always been in favour of formation of smaller states. It was during the\nNDA\u2019s rule that the three small states of Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh were cre-\nated. Keeping in mind its commitment to good governance and all-round development, the BJP\nin future, too, would encourage the cause of establishment of smaller States.\n\nIn consonance with its policy, the BJP supports the creation of Telangana as a separate\nState of the Union of India.\n\nWe will sympathetically examine and appropriately consider the long pending demands\nof the Gorkhas, the Adivasis and other people of Darjeeling district and Dooars region.\n\nNorth-East\n\nPoor governance, corruption and insurgency have resulted in the resources-rich north-\neastern States lagging behind. The physical distance between the North-East and New Delhi\nhas contributed to the widening of psychological distance. The NDA years saw the Union\nGovernment actively pushing a development agenda for the north-eastern States. A similar but\nmore robust agenda will be crafted by the BJP in power for the welfare of every north-eastern\nState and the region\u2019s rapid development. In doing so, the BJP will be guided by the following:\n\n1. Immediate steps will be taken to stem the tide of illegal immigration from Bangladesh to\nAssam and other North-Eastern States. The construction of the India-Bangladesh border\nfence will be completed without any further delay. A special cell will be set up to monitor\nthe detection, detention and deportation of illegal immigrants.\n\n2. Insurgent groups will be dealt with firmly. Simultaneously, the grievances of a section of\nthe youth will be identified and addressed.\n\n3. The land and culture of indigenous ethnic groups will be protected.\n4. Flood control in Assam and river water management will receive special attention.\n\n5. Appropriate resources will be allocated for land development, agriculture and allied\nactivities, housing, nutrition, health, education, rural connectivity and irrigation.\n\n6. New institutions of higher education in engineering and medical sciences will be set up.\n\n7. Job-generating schemes will be initiated, especially in the services sector, to address the\nproblem of unemployment in the region. Tourism and traditional skills-based industries\nwill be given a big boost.\n\n8. Special emphasis will be given to connectivity with and within North-Eastern States.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n45\n\f\n46\n\nHill States & Desert States\n\nThe BJP recognises the special needs and unique problems of the hill and desert States.\nIn consultation with the Governments of these States, a development-based, State-specific\nmodel will be evolved so that the aspirations of the people can be met.\n\nUnion Territories\n\nGiven their unique status, Union Territories will receive special attention. We will focus\non developing and strengthening the economy of Union Territories. Tourism will be promoted;\ntribal welfare and rights will receive full attention; and, infrastructure and coastal area\ndevelopment will be given top priority.\n\nAndaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshdweep Islands\nThe BJP is committed to the protection and integrated development of our island\nterritories.\n\nJudicial Reforms\n\nThe BJP will initiate a set of judicial reforms to deal with the issue of appointment of\njudges, tackling the backlog of cases and other problems that exist at various levels of the\njudiciary.\n\nTowards this end, the BJP will:\n\n1. Streamline the appointment procedure of judges in the higher judiciary through the\nNational Judicial Commission and introduce guidelines on objective criteria to determine\nmerit.\n\n2. Double the number of courts and the judicial strength of the sub-ordinate judiciary in\nfive years.\n\n3. Create a Fund for Modernisation of Courts to improve the physical and operational\ninfrastructure of courts.\n\n4. Set up a separate class of courts for cases involving specified commercial laws such as\nthe Contract Act, Negotiable Instruments Act, and other business laws. These would\ndeliver quicker justice and be partly funded by charging both litigants a \u2018Fast Track\u2019\nfee.\n\n5. Reform the criminal justice system to make dispensation of justice simpler, quicker and\nmore effective on the basis of the Malimath Committee Report.\n\n6. Computerise and network courts all over the country for improving their efficiency.\n7. Extend fast track courts to all layers of the judiciary.\n\n8. Expand alternative disputes redressal mechanisms through Lok Adalats and Tribunals.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\n9. Appoint a Judicial Procedural Reforms Committee which will suggest, in six months,\nhow to halve the time taken to conduct every trial, civil or criminal. The aim would be to\nensure that three-fourths of all cases are completed within 12 months.\n\n10. Halve the number of cases in which the Government is a litigant in the next three years.\n\nElectoral Reforms\n\nThe BJP will seek, through consultation with other parties, to evolve a method of holding\nAssembly and Lok Sabha elections simultaneously. Apart from reducing election expenses for\nboth political parties and Government, this will ensure a certain stability for State Governments.\n\nPanchayati Raj Institutions\nTo empower self-governance at the grassroots level, the BJP will strengthen Panchayati\nRaj institutions. Towards this end, it will:\n\n1. Work for the effective financial and administrative empowerment of Panchayati Raj\ninstitutions and Urban Local Bodies in respect of funds, functions and functionaries.\nThere will be further devolution of powers by amending the Constitution.\n\n2. The institution of the Gram Sabha will be strengthened to enable a full discussion on\ndevelopment projects, scrutinise the allocation and spending of funds, and evaluating\nthe performance of elected and Government functionaries.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n47\n\f\n48\n\nPRESERVING OUR CULTURAL HERITAGE\n\nRam Setu\nRam Setu is our national heritage. Millions want to visit it and it can be developed as a\ncentre of cultural tourism. For millions it is a place of pilgrimage.\n\nSaving Rama Setu is to save the vast thorium deposits which are the future source of our\nenergy. Thorium technology will ensure India\u2019s energy security. BJP will, therefore, look for an\nalternative alignment for the proposed Sethu-Samudram Channel Project (SSCP).\n\nRam Temple\n\nThere is an overwhelming desire of the people in India and abroad to have a grand\ntemple at the birth place of Sri Ram in Ayodhya. The BJP will explore all possibilities, including\nnegotiations and judicial proceedings, to facilitate the construction of the Ram Temple in\nAyodhya.\n\nGanga\n\nGanga occupies a special place in the Indian psyche. It is most unfortunate that it has\nbeen thoroughly neglected even after India attained freedom. It is a pity that even after six\ndecades of independence Ganga continues to be thoroughly polluted and is drying. The BJP will\nensure the cleanliness, purity and uninterrupted flow of Ganga, and will take all measures,\nlegal and administrative, in this regard. Necessary financial and technical assistance will be\nprovided on priority.\n\nIn addition, a massive \u2018Clean Rivers Programme\u2019 will be launched across the country\nwith the participation of voluntary organisations.\n\nCow and its Progeny\n\nIn view of the recent judgement by the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, and\nin keeping with the Directive Principles of State Policy as contained in the Constitution, necessary\nlegal framework will be created to protect and promote cow and its progeny.\n\nIn view of the contribution of cow and its progeny to agriculture, socio-economic and\ncultural life of our country, the Department of Animal Husbandry will be suitably strengthened\nand empowered for the protection and promotion of cow and its progeny. A National Cattle\nDevelopment Board will be set up to implement a programme for the improvement of indigenous\nlivestock breeds.\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\f\nMonasteries and Temples\n\nThe BJP shall ensure autonomous administration of Maths and Mandirs.\n\nThese institutions have been the heart and hub of dharmic and cultural life and traditions\nof Indian society. Huge properties were offered to Maths and Mandirs by society for running\ntheir religio-cultural activities and service projects for the benefit of all. The management of\nsuch institutions should be freed from Government control and handed over to autonomous\nbodies constituted by the followers and devotees of those seats. Necessary legal framework will\nbe provided for this purpose.\n\nAll dharmic activities will be considered as \u2018charity\u2019 with appropriate tax incentives. A\nspecial cell will be created to make dharmic organisations\u2019 interface with government agencies\nhassle-free.\n\nA National Mission for beautifying and improving the infrastructure and amenities at\npilgrimage centres of all faiths will be launched.\n\nWaaqf Properties\n\nThe BJP will examine the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee\nregarding Waqf properties headed by Shri K Rahman Khan, Deputy Chairman, Rajya Sabha,\nand would, in consultation with Muslim religious leaders, take steps to remove encroachments\nfrom and unauthorised occupation of wagf properties.\n\nHeritage Sites\nThe ASI will be provided with appropriate resources for the maintenance of all national\nheritage sites and prevent their vandalisation in any form.\n\nLanguages\n\nIndian languages are repositories of our rich literature, history, culture, art and scientific\nachievements. Many of our dialects are important source for knowing our heritage. Samskrit\nand Tamil have made remarkable contributions in this regard. B.J.P. would promote Indian\nlanguages and measures for the development of all Indian languages including Urdu will be\ntaken by providing adequate resources so that they become a powerful vehicle for creating a\nknowledge society.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party\n11 Ashok Road, New Delhi-110001\n\n \n\nBJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009\n\n49\n\f\n", "BJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 1996": "ELECTION\nMANIFESTO \u2014 1996\n\nUntitled-6 245 11/7/2016 8:39:37 PM\n\f\nUntitled-6 246 11/7/2016 8:39:37 PM\n\f\nOur Vision, Our Faith,\nOur Commitment\n\nIt is out of the past that the future is moulded.\nIt is the past that becomes the future...\n\u2014Swami Vivekananda\n\nEven as this century draws to a close and the millennium to ins, India\nstands at a critical crossroad of history. Centuries\u2019 old hopes and\naspirations of our people yearn for a true expression. The destiny\nof our land and its people cries for fulfilment. At such crucial turns\nhistorical choices are made and instruments of change adopted.\nThat destined vehicle of change is the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nNever before in the long history of our land has the country\nbeen governed by such a morally rudderless and financially corrupt\nregime. Seldom have our trusting people been duped by a baser\nband. With the people\u2019s hopes belied and their aspirations thwarted,\nour ancient land stands today face to face with the option of a\nreal change, a chance for a true departure from the last 50 years\nof Congress misrule, an alternative and an option: The Bharatiya\nJanata Party.\n\nOur people are looking towards the BJP to become just this\ninstrument of change. The party is ready to shoulder this great\nduty and responsibility. The task is nothing short of rekindling the\nlamp of our eternal \u2018Dharma\u2019, that Sanatan thought which our sages\nbequeathed to mankind \u2014 a social system based on compassion,\ncooperation, justice, freedom, equality and tolerance.\n\nTo reallse this goal, the BJP will launch a new social, economic\nand political order. It will strive to transform the existing system of\n\nUntitled-6 247 11/7/2016 8:39:37 PM\n\f\n248 \u00a9 1996 Manifesto\n\ngovernance, to make it responsive and answerable to the concerns\nof our citizens. It will strive to make the economy cater to the\nlargest demands of the largest number. The party will endeavour\nto place in the service of the nation a political organisation that\nis conscientous and clean. Above all, the BJP will secure for India\na place in the comity of nations which befits its vast cultural,\nintellectual, economic, scientific and human wealth.\n\nWe realise that correcting the mistakes of the last 50 years of\nCongress misrule, of piecing together the shattered dreams of our\ncitizens, of restructuring our polity which has been delivered a body\nblow by the present regime, of restoring 10 the state\u2019s authority and\nreviving faith in the Government, is by no means an easy task. But\nwe also realise that only the BJP has the ideological commitment,\nmoral conviction and political courage to shoulder this task and\ngently guide our nation into the next millennium. The present\nmillennium began with the subjugation of our ancient land; let\na reinvigorated, proud, prosperous and strong India herald the\nnext millennium.\n\nIn this noble mission, we shall be guided by our Manifesto \u2014 it\ncontains our commitments to the nation and its citizens. Our state\ngovernments in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,\nMaharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi have demonstrated\nthat for the BJP, these commitments constitute a sacred covenant\nwith the people. We do what we say. This Manifesto shall be the\ncovenant of our government.\n\nWith a BJP Government at the Centre, the next five years\nwill be devoted to implementing our Manifesto based on the\nfour concepts of Suraksha, Shuchita, Swadeshi and Samrasata.\nHindutva, or cultural nationalism, shall be the rainbow which will\nbridge our present to our glorious past and pave the way for an\nequally glorious future; it will guide the transition from Swarajya\nto Surajya. Our Manifesto reflects the application of these four\nconcepts in good governance and their role in moulding the nation\nwe dreamt of on the dawn of Independence \u2014 a prosperous and\nstrong India, a country where every citizen regards this land of\nours, this Bharatbhoomi, that stretches from the Indus to the seas,\nas his sacred motherland.\n\nThe BJP believes in one nation, one people, and one culture.\n\nUntitled-6 248 11/7/2016 8:39:38 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 249\n\nWe are, therefore, committed to promoting social reconciliation\nrather than conflict. We are resolved to put an end to the politics of\ncompetitive communalism, of appeasement, and of casteism. The\npolitics of pitting caste against caste, community against community\nand class against class has torn asunder our social fabric. The BJP\nwill reweave this fabric into a harmonious pattern.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-6 249 11/7/2016 8:39:38 PM\n\f\nOur Nation, Our State,\nOur Government\n\nA New Direction, A New Dispensation.\n\nNearly half a century of Congress misrule has all but shattered the\ninternal polity of the country. There is not one institution of the\nRepublic left that can be said to now be in a state of total health.\nThe Legislature, the Executive, unfortunately the Judiciary, and\neven the media have been afflicted by the mindlessness of the\nCongress\u2019 exploitation and loot of our country.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party well recognises that to correct\nthis great wrong of the past five decades requires the skill and\ncommitment of a Vishwakarma. With humility, we address ourselves\nto this task.\n\nThe first is to restore to our state its authority. Perhaps never\nsince the scourge of the Pindaries has the writ of our state been as\nenfeebled as by this Congress misrule. The primary task, therefore,\nis to restore to the state, and to governance, its honour and its\nprestige \u2014 izzat and iqbal. For this the BJP will institute a set of\nmeasures. This is a challenge that is principally moral and only\nthen functional. The BJP commits itself, therefore, to:\n\n1. Addressing purposefully to the many challenges being\n\nposed to us in Jammu & Kashmir and in the North-East of\nIndia. We are of the view that in both these strategically\nimportant border regions of the country, misgovernance,\nneglect and emotional separation from India lie at the root\nof the problems. Terrorism and challenges to the state will\nbe met forthrightly; changes in law where warranted will\nbe brought about expeditiously; the approach will be firm\n\nUntitled-6 250 11/7/2016 8:39:38 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 251\n\nbut always fair.\n\nTo translate this Manifesto into reality, to fulfil our destined\nrole of leading India into the next millennium, the Bharatiya\nJanata Party seeks the support and cooperation of all our\ncitizens.\n\n2. Launching a major nationwide drive to identify influx\nof illicit arms and their possession. Proliferation of small\narms affects directly the law and order in the country as\nalso the security of the nation. We recognise that narcotics\nsmuggling and narco-terrorism are linked. The country\nmust be rid of both. The law in this regard will be made\nmore effective and implemented.\n\n3. Toning up the administration (as enumerated subsequently)\nand reforming its functioning, accountability and\nresponsibilities.\n\n4. Rationalising the number, structure, composition and role\nof paramilitary forces, including recent initiatives like\nNational Security Guard (NSG), Rapid Action Force (RAF)\nand Special Protection Group (SPG). We will review the\npersonal security arrangments: We believe that the security\nof the high dignitaries of the country is the responsibility\nof the state. This security, however, should neither be\nexaggerated nor intrusive. It should not ever be at the cost\nof the collective convenience of the citizens of the country.\nThe BJP will reform this.\n\nAn Agenda for Change\nConstitutional Reforms\nThe BJP believes that Centre-State relations, which have been\nona downslide for the past 50 years, need to be improved. We also\nbelieve that reforms are needed for a stronger Union and equal\nrights for all citizens.\n1. The BJP will implement the main recommendations of the\nSarkaria Commission, such as:\n(a) Restoring the balance of resources in favour of the\nStates;\n(b) Ending the misuse of Art 356 to dismiss state\ngovernments and dissolve state assemblies. We will\n\nUntitled-6 251 11/7/2016 8:39:38 PM\n\f\n252 * 1996 Manifesto\n\nexplore the possibility of making it mandatory for the\nUnion Government to seek Parliament\u2019s approval by\ntwo-thirds majority for dismissal of state governments\nand,\n\n(c) Consulting state governments before appointing\nGovernors.\n\n2. We promise to carve out Uttaranchal, Vananchal, Vidarbha\nand Chhattisgarh and give them full statehood. We will\nfurther consider setting up a commission to examine\nthe formation of smaller states. Delhi will be given full\nstatehood.\n\n3. The BJP will provide Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh in J&K\nstate with regional development councils.\n\n4. We will abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, which puts\nJammu & Kashmir on a separate and separatist pedestal,\nfor the state\u2019s full and final integration with the Union.\n\n5. We will set up an inter-state council under Article 263 of\nthe Constitution to settle all inter-State and Centre-state\ndisputes to avoid ad hoc responses to issues like that of\nCauvery waters.\n\n6. The BJP is committed to Article 44 of the Constitution. We\nwill adopt a Uniform Civil Code which will be applicable to\nevery community and foster a common Bharatiya identity,\napart from ensuring gender equality. Regressive personal\nlaws will cease to have legal validity.\n\n7. The manner of appointment of constitutional functionaries\nwill be reviewed.\n\n8. We will maintain a national register of citizens and\nintroduce a multipurpose identity card.\n\nElectoral Reforms\n\nThe BJP carries a conviction that amongst the many causes\nthat have brought the state of our polity to its present plight, a\nmajor factor is faulty elections. We will, therefore, immediately\non assuming office, implement various electoral reforms. For free,\nfair and fearless elections, the BJP will:\n\n1. Update and adopt the Goswami Committee report;\n\n2. Grant statutory status to the Code of Conduct drawn up\n\nUntitled-6 252 11/7/2016 8:39:38 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 253\n\nby the Election Commission and give it teeth;\n\n3. Introduce a scheme of state-funding of candidates to all\nlegislatures;\n\n4. Provide suitable incentives for open, official corporate\nfunding to all recognised political parties;\n\n5. Undertake fresh delimitation of Lok Sabha and Assembly\nconstituencies on the basis of the 1991 census;\n\n6. Make it mandatory for political parties to submit audited\naccounts for public scrutiny annually;\n\n7. Examine the feasibility of introducing the list system;\n\n8. Expedite the process of issuing identity cards to all voters\nand make it a mandatory requirement for voting;\n\n9. Scrutinise all voters\u2019 lists to ensure that no legitimate voter\nis excluded;\n\n10. Take steps to curb expenditure on elections by imposing\na ban on advertisements, cutouts, etc;\n\n11. Introduce electronic voting machines to hasten the process\nof counting;\n\n12. Examine the possibility of simultaneous elections to the\nParliament, State Assemblies and Panchayats;\n\n13. Ensure speedy and exemplary punishment for those who\nindulge in booth-capturing;\n\n14. Officials found guilty of involvement in poll rigging will\nbe given exemplary punishment;\n\n15. Amend the anti-defection law whereby a member of\nany Legislature who changes parties will lose his or her\nmembership of the House; and,\n\n16. Prevent the misuse of Doordarshan and A.LR. by the ruling\n\nparty.\n\nCorruption & Its Cure\n\nThe BJP treats this affliction as the single greatest wrong that\nthe Congress misrule of the past 50 years has brought about on\nour land. The corruption that now corrodes our country is of the\nspirit, it is moral, and it is also financial. The challenge thus to\ngovernance is principally of setting an example \u2014 of impeccable\nprobity and unimpeachable accountability of all public men and\nwomen. This must not cover simply the elected representatives\n\nUntitled-6 253 11/7/2016 8:39:39 PM\n\f\n254 \u00a9 1996 Manifesto\n\nof the people but also the executive, the police and, indeed, even\nthe judiciary, where the touch of corruption can easily be felt.\nThe BJP will address itself to this challenge and task, by adopting\nmeasures that are mentioned here. We do not claim that this is\neither the ultimate blueprint for the reduction of corruption or the\nlast word on it. It is an expression of our commitment; a first step\nto setting right a very great wrong of many years\u2019 malignancy; a\nbeginning and that, too, with ourselves. For a clean public life in\nwhich morality and ethics find due recognition, the BJP will:\n\n1. Make it obligatory on every elected representative to\nmake, public his entire income and wealth within 90 days\nof election;\n\n2. Introduce extensive regulations and requirements upon\nthose who hold public office so that no conflict of interest\nis ever permitted to influence a proper discharge of their\nduties;\n\n3. Appoint a Lok Pal to entertain complaints of corruption\nagainst anybody holding public office, including the Prime\nMinister;\n\n4. Take measures to modify and reform the methodology\nof government approval for contracts, schemes and\nlarge money value agreements so as to make them more\ntransparent. The powers of patronage, the right to say\n\u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 to simple daily requirements of the citizens\nwill be reduced drastically. A government that intrudes\nthe least, we hold, governs the best. We will endeavour\nto combine this with open and transparent governance;\n\n5. Expeditiously deal with cases of corruption unresolved\nand in which no action has been taken in the past 10 years;\n\n6. Take steps to ensure that investigative and intelligence\nagencies like RAW, IB and CBI are not used to subserve\nthe political designs of the ruling party.\n\nJudicial Reforms\nFor speedy, fair and inexpensive justice, the BJP will:\n1. Appoint special judges to clear the huge arrears at all\nlevels of the judiciary;\n2. Fill the vacancies in the High Courts and the Supreme\n\nUntitled-6 254 11/7/2016 8:39:39 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 255\n\nCourt without any further delay;\n\n3. Legislate to the effect that courts do not give unending\nadjournments and complete cases within one year.\n\n4. Constantly review the salaries and pension benefits of all\njudges so as to attract the best legal talent to the judiciary;\n\n5. Expand and strengthen the existing legal aid facilities for\neconomically weaker sections of the society; and,\n\n6. Set up a National Judicial Commission which will be\nresponsible for making judicial appointments in the High\nCourts and the Supreme Court.\n\nPanchayati Raj\nFor better local self-governance at the village-level, the BJP will:\n1. In the light of recent experience, make changes in the\nConstitution 73rd and 74th amendments to further\nstrengthen the Panchayati Raj system; and,\n2. Endeavour to make the panchayats financially self-sufficient.\n\nAdministrative Reforms\n\nFor a caring, just and accountable administration, to provide\nhigh quality services the citizens value and for a new paradigm in\npublic administration, the BJP will:\n\n1. Make the district administration accountable for any\noutbreak of violence; institute a time-bound inquiry;\npublish the findings; punish the guilty; and, compensate\nthe victims;\n\n2. Update and implement the National Police Commission\nreport in a time-bound manner;\n\n3. Ask each Ministry /Department to set clear performance\nstandards, including cost consciousness, in quantifiable\nterms and monitor the adherence to these standards;\n\n4. Introduce a scheme of fixed minimum tenure for some\nidentified posts at higher ranks, e.g. Chief Secretaries,\nSecretaries to Government, DGPs, etc;\n\n5. Disfavour extensions to bureaucrats and police officers;\n\n6. Institute an annual Sardar Patel award for the best three\ndistrict officers, as a beginning;\n\n7. Ensure uniform housing and other related facilities for\n\nUntitled-6 255 11/7/2016 8:39:39 PM\n\f\n256 * 1996 Manifesto\n\nofficers in the same grade and in the same station. The\nsystem of allotment of houses will be made transparent;\n8. Introduce a system of allowing lateral entry of personnel\nfrom the private sector, NGOs, educational/research\ninstitutes into government;\n9. Identify areas from which government must withdraw so\nthat departments can be wound up ina phased manner;\n\n10. Strengthen the department of administrative reforms at\nthe Centre and in the States; and,\n\n11. Give the citizens what is their due. A huge divide today\nseparates the citizen, the society and the state. This is\nprincipally on account of the state not treating the rights\nof the citizens as sacrosanct; not fulfilling its obligations\ntowards the citizens sincerely; and, not providing to the\ncitizens the services that are its bounden duty. The BJP\nwill, therefore, identify such areas as warrant immediate\ncorrection, as they affect the daily life of the ordinary\ncitizen, and implement reforms in them within a given\ntimeframe.\n\nShri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya\n\nThe BJP is committed to the concept of one nation, one people,\none culture \u2014 our nationalist vision is not merely bound by the\ngeographical or political identity of India, but defined by our\nancient cultural heritage. From this belief flows our faith in \u2018Cultural\nNationalism\u2019 which is the core of Hindutva. That, we believe, is\nthe identity of our ancient nation \u2014 Bharatvarsha.\n\nHindutva is a unifying principle which alone can preserve\nthe unity and integrity of our nation. It is a collective endeavour\nto protect and re-energise the soul of India, to take us into the next\nmillennium as a strong and prosperous nation. Hindutva is also\nthe antidote to the shameful efforts of any section to benefit at the\nexpense of others.\n\nWe hold that only by recognising the limitless strength of\ncultural nationalism, can the nation be moulded. When the BJP\njoined the movement for the construction of the Shri Ram Mandir\nat Ayodhya, it was to strengthen just these foundations.\n\nOn coming to power, the BJP Government will facilitate the\n\nUntitled-6 256 11/7/2016 8:39:39 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 257\n\nconstruction of a magnificent Shri Ram Mandir at Janmasthan in\nAyodhya which will be a tribute to Bharat Mata. This dream moves\nmillions of people in our land; the concept of Rama lies at the core\nof their consciousness.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-6 257 11/7/2016 8:39:39 PM\n\f\nOur Economy, Action And Direction\n\nEconomic Growth and Employment Through Swadeshi\n\nFour decades of Congress misrule have ruined the economic\ncreativity of our country; these decades failed to place the country\nona sound economic footing, befitting India\u2019s stature as the largest\ndemocracy in the world. The experiments of the Congress, with\nvastly divergent models, have brought the country, from time to\ntime, to the brink of crisis. The passive victim of all these experiments\nhas been the long suffering citizen of our country; even as under-\nnourishment, malnutrition, illiteracy and deprivation afflict a\nlarge percentage of them; even as the quality of life gets fractured\nbetween India and Bharat.\n\nWe commit ourselves to bringing certainty in economic policy.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party is proud of India\u2019s heritage and has\nan abiding faith in the creative genius of every Indian. We are\ncommitted to an economy that enables India to achieve its destiny\nin the forefront of the nations of the world.\n\nIn 1991, the present government claimed that it inherited an\neconomy which had a slender foreign exchange reserves. Accepting\nIMF conditionalities, it initiated a programme of deregulation of\nindustry, trade and exchange rate policies, a radically different\napproach to foreign investment. The consequential foreign\nexchange reserves that it will be leaving, as a legacy to the successor\ngovernment, are, however, fragile, being composed mainly of\nquick-sand components of foreign institutional investments and\nFCNR deposits. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is only a minor\ncomponent of them. An enormous $7 billion becomes ripe for debt\nservicing in 1996-97 itself. In its zeal to contain fiscal deficits task in\nwhich it failed, the fiscal deficit continuing around 7% of GDP \u2014it\n\nUntitled-6 258 11/7/2016 8:39:39 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 259\n\npruned developmental expenditure beyond acceptable limits, in\nconsequence constraining growth.\n\nDespite the proclaimed deregulation, over the past five years,\nall earlier structures and institutions of the License Quota-Permit\nRaj remain intact. Social infrastructure has been neglected and the\nlot of the poor and deprived has further deteriorated. The country\u2019s\ndefence requirements were also neglected, thereby putting the\nnation\u2019s security in jeopardy.\n\nThe neglect of infrastructure by this government has left a\nlegacy of a fractured physical infrastructure \u2014 roads, railways, post,\npower, telecom \u2014are grinding to near immobility, in the process\nconstraining growth elsewhere in the economy. In its methodology\nfor containing the budget through limits on monetisation of the\ndeficit, this government has compulsorily resorted to heavy\nborrowings, which in turn, has resulted in liquidity to the rest of\nthe economy and a heating up of the interest rates. Our domestic\nindustry, starved of liquidity, is in danger of slipping into recession.\n\nIn totality, this government will leave an economy more fragile\nand shattered than what it inherited in 1991. The challenges thus,\nto us in our bid at governance, are formidable.\n\nOur Economic Thought\n\nIn outlining our strategy, we recognise that the post Cold War\nworld has adopted the market place for fast economic growth.\nHowever, our thought is defined by the following:\n\n(i) Market may ensure growth, but it cannot ensure redistribute\nequity and justice. The state continues to have a role to\nplay;\n\n(ii) The poor and deprived have, therefore, to be helped by the\nstate to cross the poverty line and to attain a sustainable\nminimum quality of life;\n\n(iii) On the economic front, the old order, based on comparative\nadvantage of labour or resources, is giving way to a new\norder built on the basis of human resources, skills and\ntechnology. A proper policy can make it India\u2019s strength;\nand\n\n(iv) A society such as ours has to innovate its own strategy,\nto adapt itself to the high-tech challenges of a supposedly\n\nUntitled-6 259 11/7/2016 8:39:40 PM\n\f\n260 * 1996 Manifesto\n\nborderless world, without the attendant social stresses,\neconomic instability and the abandonment either of its\nidentity or of its own socio-cultural ethos. This is the essence\nof our Swadeshi approach: A self-reliant India, asserting\nits national economic interests, not as autarchy, but as a\npre-requisite to meeting the challenge of globalisation;\nof preserving our identity without compromising\nour sovereignty or self respect. We reject unbridled\nconsumerism and believe in adherence to sustainable\nconsumption and growth.\n\nForeign investment will be required and encouraged for world\nclass technology. But when foreign savings have to supplement and\nassist the economy in circumstances where domestic savings are\ninadequate, we compromise with the nation\u2019s long term interests.\nWhile many countries which started late but arrived much earlier\nthan India, managed their growth on savings levels around 35-40%\nof GDP, the Indian domestic savings rate has steadily declined to\na low level of 20% of GDP during Congress rule. This is grossly\ninadequate for even the current level of investment, let alone the\nlevels required for a faster growth of the economy. Not only have\nprivate savings declined, more worrisomely, governmental savings\nare now virtually nil.\n\nWe recognise two immediate priorities \u2014 first, providing the\nphysical and economic infrastructure that is appropriate for the\nstipulated growth in our GDP; second, providing the required social\ninfrastructure for a minimum sustainable quality of life.\n\nTo attain these and yet contain fiscal deficit requires a different\napproach. The BJP will work towards pruning non-developmental\nexpenditure; minimise the commercial activities of government;\nseverely cutting back on bureaucracy; shedding the structures of\ncontrols and regulation; and re-equipping itself for its new role\nof providing a framework for free market operations for growth,\naccentuating programmes for poverty eradication and social\nInfrastructure.\n\nFiscal Reform and Taxation\n\nWe believe that taxation alone cannot be the base for revenue.\nA stable and fast growth is possible only through a high order of\n\nUntitled-6 260 11/7/2016 8:39:40 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 261\n\ninvestment matched by an appropriate level of domestic savings.\nThe present government has done a great disservice by encouraging\navoidable consumerism and diverting the depleted savings into\nspeculative rather than safe and productive channels.\n\u00a2 We will structure our fiscal reforms so that savings and\ncontracted savings are augmented to levels that will take\ncare of a higher order of investment needed for faster\ngrowth;\n\u00a2 In taxation, we will ensure that not only levels and rates\nof taxation are such that growth is not constrained, but\nthat the burden-sharing of taxes is equitably distributed\namong all affluent sections of society. We will mitigate\nthe undue rigours of indirect taxes \u2014 today indirect taxes\nconstitute 71 % of tax revenue \u2014so that productivity and\ngrowth are not hampered.\n\nWe will devise a suitably structured valued added tax (VAT)\nso as to ensure better burden-sharing among \u2018goods and services\u2019\nthat contribute to value addition.\n\n\u00a2 In tariffs we will ensure that the domestic sector gets a\nlevel playing field, and does not become uncompetitive;\n\n\u00a2 We will also strive to lighten the debt burden on the nation.\nThis in turn will contribute to interest rate stabilisation;\n\n\u00a2 We will not hike Excise Duties on items of mass\nconsumption;\n\n\u00a2 We will examine the aspect of sales tax reform and\nequalisation.\n\n\u00a2 We will ensure operational autonomy of the RBI;\n\n\u00a2 We will adopt firm measures to prevent the generation of\nblack money;\n\n\u00a2 We will rationalise and simplify the present tax structure\nand raise the Income Tax exemption limit to Rs. 60,000;\n\n\u00a2 We will provide weighted deductions taking number of\ndependents on earning member;\n\n\u00a2 We will exempt all investments in approved organisations,\nprivate OR public, from the levy of Wealth Tax.;\n\n\u00a2 Wewill give tax reliefs to employment-oriented industries\nin non-municipal areas;\n\n\u00a2 We will ensure minimum contribution to government\n\nUntitled-6 261 11/7/2016 8:39:40 PM\n\f\n262 * 1996 Manifesto\n\nexchequer by all profit-earning business units. The concept\nof \u2018zero business units\u2019 will be done away with;\n\n\u00a2 We will give special tax concessions to writers, artists,\nacademics and others engaged in intellectual and cultural\npursuits.\n\nPrice Stability and Consumer Protection\nIt is our firm belief that the price level can be controlled\nonly through maximisation of production and a minimisation of\ncosts of production. This is to be achieved through technology\nupgradation, economics of scale and free competition. Towards\nthis end, the BJP will:\n\u00a2 Ensure an efficient, low-cost, corruption-free PDS, so that\nthere is a regular, assured, timely and adequate supply of\ncommodities to the consumers in the rural, tribal, remote\nand backward areas of our country;\n\u00a2 Supply better quality foodgrains through the PDS by\nenhancing the norms for quality standards rather than\neasing them as has been done by the Congress;\n\u00a2 Make pulses, cooking oil and soap also available through\nPDS, in addition to food-grains, sugar and kerosene;\n\u00a2 Improve the Consumer Protection Act of 1986, and ensure\nits application; and,\n\u00a2 Encourage consumer movements.\n\nBlack Money and Corruption\nStarting from its Jana Sangh days, the BJP has been waging\na relentless battle against the twin evils of corruption and black\nmoney. We are committed to rooting out corruption, thus also the\nmalignancy of black money.\n\u00a2 We will encourage capital creation through funds from\nsuch a parallel economy, retaining the right of government\nto tax the revenue flows from such created capital.\n\u00a2 The BJP will open up sectors such as social forestry,\nwasteland development and housing for rural and urban\npoor.\n\u00a2 We will also review the rationale of the Urban Land Ceiling\nAct, in this context.\n\nUntitled-6 262 11/7/2016 8:39:40 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 263\n\nInfrastructure\nWe hold that power, telecommunications, transport (surface,\nsea and air) constitute the basic building blocks of our development.\nWith hardly 50% of the roads surfaced, about 40% of the traffic\nvolume is handled by the National Highway System (NHS) which\nconstitutes hardly 2% of the road network.\nOur Railway network has grown only by 16% over five decades.\nThe ports have become the greatest constraint on our world trade.\nThe dimensions of the power and telecommunications situation\ncripple development.\n\u00a2 Weneed to actively develop a National Waterways network;\n\u00a2 To meet our minimum needs, a staggering 10,000 MW\nhave to be added annually for the next 15 years. Irrigation\nneeds press upon our resources. All these call for large\ninvestments.\n\u00a2 We propose, therefore, to lay the foundations of a strong\nbond market in the country which can take care of the\nmassive financial requirements. We invite foreign capital\nin the field of infrastructure.\n\u00a2 We will initate a framework which will facilitate quick\nredressal of the acute infrastructure crisis based on\ninternational co-operation and partnership.\n\u00a2 We will strive to confine the role of the state to that of a\nfacilitator, withdrawing in favour of suitably structured\nindependent regulatory authorities.\n\nPublic Sector\nAt present the policy relating to public sector is in disarray.\n\u00a2 The BJP believes in confining the public sector only to\nsensitive areas where the nation\u2019s security is involved and\nto areas where the presence of public sector is necessary\nfor providing a moderating or counter-poising role to the\nill effects, if any, of an unchecked private sector.\n\u00a2 Public sector presence will continue in areas furthering\nsocial objectives.\n\u00a2 The remaining public sector that would continue will be\nmanaged with the least interference by government.\nIn the case of disinvestment from ailing, non-profitable or sick\n\nUntitled-6 263 11/7/2016 8:39:40 PM\n\f\n264 * 1996 Manifesto\n\npublic sector undertakings, the BJP will constitute a Disinvestment\nCommission for taking care of disinvestment from the country\u2019s\npublic sector.\n\u00a2 While disinvesting, care will be taken so that the workers\u2019\ninterests are not harmed.\n\u00a2 The National Renewal Fund will be realigned to take\ncare of the constant requirements of retraining and\nredeployment of workers that may be necessary in a fast\ngrowing economy.\n* Sales proceeds from PSU disinvestment will be utilised\nonly on capital expenditure.\n\nForeign Trade and Capital\n\nForeign Trade Policy has in the past degenerated into one of\nproviding palliatives. It has now become necessary to strengthen\nthe interface between industry and trade.\n\n\u00a2 We will select core industries and a system of destinations\nand initiate an integrated production for export planning\nwith selective intervention so that this sector, so vital to\nthe economy, acquires dynamism.\n\n\u00a2 We will also strive to forge such alliances with or\nmemberships of regional trading blocs that will give further\nimpetus to our exports.\n\nThe BJP welcomes foreign investment, because we hold that\nit supplies knowledge, technology and know-how and sharpens\nthe quality and competitive edge of our economy.\n\n\u00a2 We will, however, strive to minimise our dependence on\nforeign savings.\n\n\u00a2 We will prioritise foreign investment in sectors that will\npromote exports in preference to sectors that will cater\nsolely or exclusively to the domestic market.\n\n\u00a2 Keeping in view that dissemination of world class\ntechnology is an objective of foreign investment, we will\ngive preference to overseas investors who have domestic\npartners.\n\n\u00a2 We will encourage foreign investment in infrastructure,\nareas of high technology and R & D within India.\n\n\u00a2 As for MNCs in consumer non-durables, we do not consider\n\nUntitled-6 264 11/7/2016 8:39:41 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 265\n\nthem as areas of priority.\n\nIndustrial Policy\n\nIndustry in India has to be enabled to become more productive,\nmore innovative. Only then will it fulfil its main goal: Enhance the\nnational wealth, provide greater employment in ever increasing\nnumbers and thus assist the growth of other sectors, including\nagriculture. For, we ecognise this inseperable interdependence.\nOur exports must compete with the best in the world, add to our\nresources and fiscal health, and thus enable India to achieve the\nstatus that we believe is its destiny. The BJP assures all about\ncreating a healthy investment and industrial environment.\n\nThe BJP believes in the continued role and relevance of the\nsmall-scale sector. This important segment of our national economy,\nwhich has been entirely ignored by the Congress and whose\nvery existence is threatened by the present policy of economic\nliberalisation, will receive all encouragement and help from a BJP\nGovernment.\n\nThe following principles will guide the industrial policy of\nthe BJP:\n\nA. Economic Sovereignty\n\nThe party regards the preservation of the nation\u2019s economic\ninterests as a component of our external economic relations.\nGlobalisation, to us, is not a synonym for the obliteration of national\neconomic interests. Indeed, in the ensuing global competition we\nneed to be constantly mindful of preserving them.\n\nB. Modernisation\n\nBJP stands for a mode 24 and progressive India, open to new\nideas, new technology and fresh capital. A modern India to the BJP\nis not a westernised India; a pale copy of the western economic\nmodels.\n\nC. Decentralisation\nWe stand for a decentralised economic order. The BJP stands for\npolitical as well as economic democracy. The role of the government\n\nUntitled-6 265 11/7/2016 8:39:41 PM\n\f\n266 * 1996 Manifesto\n\nmust change from the restrictive to the supportive and encouraging.\nThe BJP will, therefore:\n\u00a2 Debureaucratise industrial approvals and cut down the\nplethora of restrictive controls. Industrial Development and\nRegulations Act will be replaced by Industrial Development\nAct;\n\u00a2 Encourage research and development as part of the process\nof industrial growth and over-all modernisation;\n\u00a2 Hazardous industries will be permitted only in specified\nareas. Separate industrial satellites will be set up exclusively\nfor such units;\n\u00a2 Small-scale sector will be given all importance and\nencouragement. We will establish agencies to help the\nsmall-scale sector in purchasing, marketing and selling\ntheir products; and,\n\u00a2 Ensure a healthy capital market.\n\n \n\nUntitled-6 266 11/7/2016 8:39:41 PM\n\f\nOur Concept Of Employment\nAnd Labour\u2019s Role\n\nCreating Jobs and Opportunities\n\nApart from employment which will be created in the normal\ncourse by the growth of the economy, special employment schemes\nwill be undertaken by the Bharatiya Janata Party to eradicate\nunemployment.\n\nThe BJP proposes to introduce a scheme of voluntary National\nService to undertake the task of national reconstruction and also\nin order to instill a sense of discipline and nationalism among the\nyouth of the country. This service will aim at reclaiming wasteland\nfor commercial use \u2014 for instance, after reclaiming the waste land,\nit will be used for horticulture, social forestry or any other purpose\nthat will provide the youth involved in the reclamation with\ncontinued income. Similarly, the National Service will be used for\nriver management schemes.\n\nApart from this, the BJP proposes to:\n\n1. Increase employment opportunities in all sectors of the\norganised economy;\n2. Introduce policies and programmes to:\n(i) Develop agriculture, particularly in regions which\nare at present less developed and backward.\n\n(ii) Promote industrial growth with special attention\nto village, cottage and small-scale sectors. Special\nemphasis will be laid on agro-industry.\n\n(iii) Undertake large-scale housing activity that will\ngenerate both jobs and additional shelter in both\nrural and urban areas.\n\nUntitled-6 267 11/7/2016 8:39:41 PM\n\f\n268 * 1996 Manifesto\n\n(iv) Provide transport facilities with special emphasis in\nimproving availability of transport in rural areas.\n\n(v) Augment employment opportunities in villages\nthrough Schemes like Antyodaya, Gokul Gram, Gopal\nGram, Saraswati Yojana as already being implemented\nby BJP governments in Rajasthan and Gujarat.\n\n(vi) Provide and improve infrastructure, especially in\nrural areas, such as roads, small dams and water\nconservation projects.\n\n(vii) Promote vocational training.\n\nLabour\n\nBJP believes in healthy trade unionism. It will:\n\n1. Rationalise and simplify Labour Laws;\n\n2. Recognise unions on the basis of secret ballot and have\nprovisions for comprehensive bargaining;\n\n3. Introduce worker participation from the shop floor to the\nboard room in all public sector projects, public limited\ncompanies and foreign companies operating in India;\n\n4. Protect workers against inflation;\n\n5. Evolve an effective mechanism and ensure better\nimplementation of laws to protect labour from occupational\nhealth hazards arising from industries like asbestos, cement,\nslate, mica, chemicals, textiles, etc. The workers will have\nthe right to be informed about the possible health hazards\nthey could be exposed to on the shop floor; and,\n\n6. Not allow an exit policy without fulfilling corresponding\nobligations towards labour.\n\nGovernment Employees\n\nBJP will set up a permanent Employees Welfare Board witha\nview to resolving the long-standing problems related to:\n\n1. Time scale promotion;\n\n2. Revision of pay scales and award of bonus;\n\n3. Implementation of awards;\n\n4. Housing; and,\n\n5. Social welfare measures and travel concession for retired\n\npersonnel. Oo\n\n \n\nUntitled-6 268 11/7/2016 8:39:41 PM\n\f\nOur Scientific Talent, Our Technology\n\nHarnessing Nature For Human Welfare\n\nThe BJP believes that science and technology must play its due role\nin transforming India into a prosperous and strong country. The\nBJP will apply appropriate scientific and technological methods for\nincreasing productivity, eradicating poverty, hunger and disease\nand providing meaningful employment along with the basic\namenities of life. We believe that science and technology need to be\nharnessed to improve the lot of the vast section of our population\nliving below the poverty line. We hold that science is not merely\nharnessing nature for material wealth but is as well for liberating\nand enriching the mind and enlarging the human spirit. The BJP\nwill use science in the service of the poor and develop technology\nthat has a humane face. Towards this end, we will:\n\n1. Foster a scientific temper among the people;\n\n2. Use science and technology for increasing productivity\nand generating employment;\n\n3. Implement a vigorous programme of science education\nand research for improving quality of life;\n\n4. Establish a network of centres for application of science\nand technology to rural areas, implement \u2018lab-to-land\u2019\nprogrammes and develop a strong low-cost agro-Industrial\nbase;\n\n5. Put new life into National Laboratories to develop them\nas centres of excellence in applied research;\n\n6. Direct these laboratories to evolve appropriate technology\nfor Indian needs;\n\n7. Accelerate the production of scientific literature in regional\nlanguages and evolve a national terminology for science\n\nUntitled-6 269 11/7/2016 8:39:41 PM\n\f\n270 * 1996 Manifesto\n\nand technology;\n\n8. Create the right working conditions for our best brains to\nremain in India and serve the country and not migrate to\nother lands;\n\n9. Make a systematised effort to bring national laboratories\nand industry together by setting up \u2018Technology Parks\u2019 to\nbe patronised by industry. This will promote cooperation\nbetween industry\u2019s resources and talent in laboratory;\n\n10. Safeguard national interests and our intellectual property\nrights by encouraging research and development;\n\n11. Undertake research in the field of drugs, micro-biology,\nbio-technology, bio-fertilisers etc.; and,\n\n12. Strengthen research in indigenous systems of medicine.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-6 270 11/7/2016 8:39:42 PM\n\f\nOur Foreign Policy\n\nIndia, the New Millennium, the World\n\nIn a post-Cold War world India will be confronted by many new\nchallenges and opportunities. To meet them, to benefit from the\nopportunities, mindful of the existing global disequilibrium and\nin consonance with India\u2019s national interests, our foreign policy in\nthe emerging decades will be based on the human values of peace,\nequality and cooperation.\n\nThe BJP holds that as a departure from the recent past, Indian\ndiplomacy should be conducted in tune with India\u2019s position as\na strong power and a major player in the world arena. A billion\npeople who do not depend upon anyone for feeding or clothing\nthemselves are a power which cannot be ignored. Our nation needs\nto regain its lost pride and the BJP alone can undertake this task.\nWhile we believe in partnership with everyone, we reject the very\nthought of patronage by anybody. The BJP\u2019s foreign policy will be\nguided by the following agenda:\n\n1. Sovereign equality amongst nations; a rejection of political\n\nor economic hegemonism.\n\n2. Promotion of Asian solidarity; development of South\nAsian Regional Cooperation; and, emphasis on improved\nrelations with neighbouring countries. The BJP does not\naccept outside interference in this region as being beneficial\nfor it.\n\n3. Pakistan continues to follow a policy of fomenting\ninsurgency seeking to create instability and unrest in India.\nThe BJP stands committed to thwarting all these attempts.\nIn this context, we state:\n\n(a) The BJP affirms unequivocally India\u2019s sovereignty over\n\nUntitled-6 271 11/7/2016 8:39:42 PM\n\f\n272 * 1996 Manifesto\n\nthe whole of Jammu & Kashmir, including Pakistan\noccupied Kashmir; and,\n\n(b) The BJP declares that it will not accept any interference\nin our country\u2019s internal affairs.\n\n4. Our relations with the USA will be based on mutual respect\nand a congruence of interests. We note, however, that\nUS policy for this region continues to suffer from lack of\nvision and that it disregards India\u2019s political and security\ninterests.\n\n5. India and Russia have a long tradition of good relations\nand have much to gain from the compatibility of their\ngeopolitical interests in Asia. The BJP will endeavour to\nfurther explore the avenues of bilateral cooperation in this\ndirection.\n\n6. Our relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China offer an\nopportunity to now put them on a footing of friendship\nand cooperation. For this we need to resolve the border\nquestion in a fair and equitable manner. It cannot, however,\nbe ignored that the People\u2019s Republic of China continues\nto support Pakistan militarily and otherwise.\n\n7. The BJP greatly regrets the continuing bloodshed in Sri\nLanka, particularly as India all through its history has had\nwarm fraternal ties with all sections of the population in\nthat country. The BJP is confident that within a united Sri\nLanka it should be possible to fulfil the aspirations of the\nTamil people.\n\n8. The BJP pledges to maintain warm and friendly relations\nwith Nepal, with which India has the closest cultural,\nreligious and historical ties. The BJP will work actively\nfor resolving all outstanding issues. We welcome the\nrestoration of democracy in Nepal.\n\n9. The BJP views with great sympathy the struggle for\nrestoration of democracy in Myanmar. It extends its\nsupport to the task of reconciliation and reconstruction\nin that country with which India has a long border and\nage-old religious, cultural and historicalties.\n\n10. The BJP will try to consolidate further the close and friendly\nties between India and Bhutan.\n\nUntitled-6 272 11/7/2016 8:39:42 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 273\n\n11. Inour relations with Bangladesh, illegal immigration into\nIndia from that country has proved a major irritant. This\nissue has cast its shadow on our bilateral ties and needs\nto be resolved early.\n\n12. Millions of sons and daughters of Mother India, settled\nabroad as Overseas Indians, are considered by the BJP as\nan asset to the country. Their emotional attachment to the\nmotherland is still deep. This must find due expression.\nSchemes will be drawn up to attract substantial investments\nby non-resident Indians. They will be welcome to set up\nindustrial units and industrial parks, and invest in the\ninfrastructure. The BJP will examine afresh the issue of\ndual citizenship.\n\n13. The BJP will launch a vigorous campaign for a permanent\nmembership for India in the UN Security Council.\n\nThe BJP stands committed to peace amongst all nations;\nprosperity for all the peoples of the world; and, an international\nrole for India that befits this great and ancient nation.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-6 273 11/7/2016 8:39:42 PM\n\f\nOur Nation\u2019s Security\n\nProtecting Our Country\n\nThe BJP accords the highest importance to the security of our Nation,\nour Society and our Citizens. We charge the present government\nwith imperilling our security, internal and external, as never before.\n\nOur defence expenditure has been cut steadily in real terms\nduring the Narasimha Rao regime. This has seriously compromised\nour combat effectiveness. The present Congress government has\nbeen functioning without a full-time Defence Minister for over\nthree years, and this negligence of India\u2019s sword arm has begun\nto affect the morale of our gallant forces.\n\nThe BJP will correct this damaging imbalance. We will accord\ndue importance to all security related issues \u2014 the emerging\nglobal realities and regional complexities demand this as the very\nminimum response from our government.\n\nInternal Security\nThe nature of the state and its relationship with society has\na direct bearing on the level of the citizens\u2019 national commitment.\nAn insensitive and uncaring state erodes the citizens\u2019 allegiance to\nthe nation. The BJP will restore national commitment to its rightful\nplace by establishing a harmonious relationship between state and\nsociety. We will:\n1. Defuse tension in long-festering trouble spots;\n2. Ensure protection of life and property from insurgents\nand foreign mercenaries;\n3. Provide our security apparatus with a free hand to deal\nwith terrorism;\n4. Revitalise and reinforce law and order machinery;\n\nUntitled-6 274 11/7/2016 8:39:42 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 275\n\n5. Institute police reforms and upgrade the capability of the\nforce; and,\n\n6. Legislate tough deterrent laws against terrorist and\ndisruptive activities (TADA was repealed to pander to\nvote bank politics) while safeguarding democratic rights.\n\nJammu & Kashmir\n\nThe absence of political far-sightedness and clarity of national\nobjectives has resulted in our nation continuing to have to pay\na price even 50 years after Jammu & Kashmir became a part of\nthe Republic. The failure of successive Congress Governments to\nformulate a Jammu & Kashmir policy that takes into account the\nState\u2019s internal problems has led to a situation where this strategic\nborder state has emerged as the principal challenge to Indian\nnationhood. The BJP realises the magnitude of the challenge and\ndedicates itself to the task of not only solving the internal problems\nof the state but also reclaiming the portion of our territory which\nhas been illegally held by Pakistan for nearly five decades. Without\nrepeating the mistakes of yesteryears and merely reacting to\nPakistan\u2019s moves, we will:\n\n1. Immediately strengthen the civil administration by\ninducting able and honest administrators;\n\n2. Provide a free hand to our security forces to deal with\nthe menace of terrorism and induction of men and arms\nfrom Pakistan, while ensuring that democratic rights are\nnot violated;\n\n3. Cleanse the local police and administration of malcontents\nwho have aligned themselves with the terrorists or are\npro-Pakistan;\n\n4. Declare Doda a disturbed area and invoke the Armed\nForces (Special Powers) Act to prevent this district from\nbecoming a haven for mercenaries and terrorists;\n\n5. Launch a massive welfare programme for all regions of\nthe state and ensure that there is no seepage;\n\n6. Hold free and fair elections in the state after terrorism has\nbeen brought under control and every person, including\nthe Pandits who have been forced out of the Valley, is\nprovided with an opportunity to participate in the polls;\n\nUntitled-6 275 11/7/2016 8:39:43 PM\n\f\n276 * 1996 Manifesto\n\n7. Rehabilitate all persons displaced from terrorism-afflicted\nareas of Jammu & Kashmir; and,\n8. Set up regional councils for Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh.\n\nNorth-East\nThe north-eastern states of our country continue to suffer\nfrom the violence perpetrated by insurgency and ethnic strife. Poor\ngovernance, a callous administration, seepage of development\nfunds, and Congress\u2019 politics of manipulation have contributed\nto the alienation of the people and the growth of insurgency.\nIn Assam, ULFA and Bodo militants have begun to strike with\nregularity; in Nagaland and Manipur the NSCN continues with\nits depredation; and, in Tripura, militant tribal outfits have once\nagain reared their ugly heads. The tide of illegal immigration from\nBangladesh has only worsened the situation. The BJP will address\nitself to the problems of our north-eastern States and institute a\ngrievance redressal system monitored from Delhi. It will also take\nthe following steps to restore the rule of law in the troubled States:\n1. Check the inflow of foreign arms and terrorists from\ntraining camps across the border;\n2. Strengthen the security apparatus and intelligence network;\n3. Provide all citizens with identity cards on a priority basis;\n4. Check the narcotics trade and attendant ills in the region;\nand,\n5. Plan and execute an integrated and accelerated economic\ndevelopment programme.\n\nHimalayas\n\nOver the past five decades, our Himalayan bastions have\nbeen strategically pierced. Despite that, the attitude of successive\nCongress governments has remained unchanged. Strategically,\nthe government has failed to restore a balance there, leave alone\nregain the initiative. In the process, we have also lost large national\nterritories to the People\u2019s Republic of China, thus demonstrating\nan absence of strategic thought about our Himalayan bastions. The\nBJP will evolve a security policy for the Himalayas so that India\u2019s\nnational interests are fully safeguarded.\n\nUntitled-6 276 11/7/2016 8:39:43 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 277\n\nExternal Security\n\nWe believe that pro-active diplomacy, especially defence\ndiplomacy, coupled with adequate preparedness of our armed\nforces, is the key to securing our frontiers against aggression. This\nrequires both strategy and tactics. The BJP will:\n\n1. Set up a National Security Council;\n\n2. Re-evaluate the country\u2019s nuclear policy and exercise the\noption to induct nuclear weapons;\n\n3. Though the BJP stands committed to a nuclear-free world,\nwe cannot accept a world of nuclear apartheid.\n\n(i) The BJP will thus not agree to the Comprehensive\nTest Ban Treaty (CTBT) unless there is a simultaneous\nagreement for a time-bound global elimination of\nnuclear weapons in their entirety.\n\n(ii) The BJP will not agree to the Fissile Material Control\nRegime(FMCR).\n\n(iii) The BJP will not agree to the Missile Technology\nControl Regime (MTCR).\n\n4. Expedite the serial production of Prithvi and make Agni\nI operational for the deployment of these missiles. In\naddition, hasten the development of Agni IJ;\n\n5. Immediately upgrade conventional weapons and weapons\nsystems of the armed forces;\n\n6. Strengthen the intelligence-gathering system, inclusive of\nall intelligence agencies, initiate a Centre-State initiative on\nintelligence gathering and sharing, step up air surveillance\nof our territory, and acquire state-of-the-art electronic\nequipment;\n\n7. Strengthen the Air Force fleet with new generation aircraft;\n\n8. Make a qualitative and quantitative improvement in our\nnaval capabilities;\n\n9. Invest in R&D in areas of defence and missile technology\nso that we become increasingly self-reliant;\n\n10. Peg defence-related expenditure to real requirements; and,\n\n11. Re-examine the role, structure and composition of the\nnumerous para-military forces and reorganise and reform\nthem.\n\nUntitled-6 277 11/7/2016 8:39:43 PM\n\f\n278 \u00a9 1996 Manifesto\n\nJai Jawan\n\nThe BJP is rightly proud of our valiant soldiers who have\ndedicated their lives to defend our nation from external aggressors\nand internal subversives. We believe it is our duty to take care of\nour serving jawans and look after those who have retired from\nservice, as well as their families. To fulfil this duty, the BJP will\nadopt the following programmes and policies:\n\n1. The terms of service, including pay and allowance, housing,\neducation for children and pension, of all ranks will be\nimproved so as to attract men and women of high calibre.\nThe present shortage of men and officers does not have to\nbe met by lowering standards of entry;\n\n2. Widows and dependents of jawans who die in action will\nreceive higher benefits and compensation;\n\n3. Pension disparities will be solved and anomalies sorted\nout expeditiously;\n\n4. Hospitals for veterans will be set up throughout the country\nso that no ex-serviceman, irrespective of his rank, is denied\nmedical care;\n\n5. Ex-servicemen\u2019s welfare will be included in the concurrent\nlist;\n\n6. The services of our retired soldiers will be used to the\nmaximum extent possible, especially in insurgency-\naffected areas. Wherever there is a stipulated percentage\nfor employing ex-servicemen, it will be fulfilled;\n\n7. Necessary changes will be made in agricultural and urban\ntenancy laws to secure the proprietary rights of servicemen;\nand,\n\n8. District Sainik Boards will be strengthened.\n\nIllegal Immigration:\nDemographic Invasion \u2014 A Threat to Our Security\n\nWe believe that illegal immigration from our neighbouring\ncountries, especially Bangladesh, has a direct impact on our nation\u2019s\nsecurity and has an unsettling effect on our demography. Given\nthe sheer dimension of numbers there are as many as 1.7 crore\nillegal immigrants, the bulk of them Bangladeshis, living in various\nparts of the country. Illegal immigration is not only transforming\n\nUntitled-6 278 11/7/2016 8:39:43 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 279\n\nthe geography, but the sociology, the economy, indeed even the\npolitics of this country. India is facing an explosive issue. If our\ndemographic balance is allowed to be disturbed by inept policies\nand political considerations, various demographic entities are\nbound to come in conflict, thus adversely affecting our security\nenvironment. The invasion of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh\nhas led to an alarming growth ina section of the population in our\nNorth-East, in Assam, in West Bengal, parts of Bihar and Delhi.\nIn certain areas, a section of the population has grown by almost\n100 per cent.\nThe BJP proposes to:\n1. Complete barbed wire fencing along the India-Bangladesh\nborder, beginning with the plains, to prevent infiltration;\n2. Detect illegal immigrants, delete their names from voters\u2019\nlists and arrange for their deportation without any further\ndelay;\n3. Declare all property deals between Indians and illegal\nimmigrants as null and void;\n4. Amend immigration rules and other laws to impose\nstringent checks on illegal entry into India; and,\n5. Expedite the issuance of identity cards to all citizens o\nthe country.\n\n \n\noO\n\nUntitled-6 279 11/7/2016 8:39:44 PM\n\f\nOur Villages, Our Farmers,\nOur Poor\n\nTowards a Revitalised Rural Economy\n\nOur country has an abundance of natural resources fertile lands,\nflowing rivers, rich mineral deposits and verdant forests. More\nthan anything else, we have a large army of farmers that shoulders\nthe onerous task of feeding our people. But the wrong priorities\nof the last 50 years of Congress misrule and the lopsided model\nof development pursued by policymakers have impoverished vast\nsections of our farmers, rendering agriculture economically non-\nviable. Worse, bulk of the monies earmarked for infrastructural\ndevelopment, health, education and civic amenities has been\ncanalised to the urban areas despite the fact that the majority of\nthe population lives in villages.\n\nLess than a quarter of the country\u2019s population, 23.31 per\ncent, lives in urban areas, compared to the overwhelming 76.69\nper cent which lives in villages. As many as 71.4 per cent of our\npeople are economically dependent on agriculture: This sector\nof our economy, therefore, generates the highest employment as\nwell as provides the biggest market. Yet, this sector continues to\nbe neglected by Congress policy-makers.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party believes that India cannot emerge as\na powerful nation until the lot of our farmers is improved, adequate\nattention paid to the agricultural sector, an all-out war launched\nagainst poverty, and investments are made in agro-industry as well\nas small-scale and cottage industry catering to the requirements\nof our villages. Our country\u2019s progress is linked to the well-being\nof our villages, our farmers and our poor.\n\nUntitled-6 280 11/7/2016 8:39:44 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 281\n\nCongress\u2019 Policy: Not to Have a Policy on Agriculture\n\nIn the absence of any well thought out agricultural policy\nfocussing on rural development and reconstruction, agriculture is\nfast becoming a losing proposition for our farmers. While fixing\nagricultural prices, successive Congress governments have not\ntaken into account the expenses incurred by our farmers on seeds,\nfertiliser, power, water, pesticides, machinery and labour. No effort\nhas ever been made to bring about parity in the prices of industrial\nand agricultural produce.\n\nAs a result, our farmers are forced to sell the fruit of their labour\nat low prices even while they have to pay ever-increasing prices\nfor the necessary inputs. Not surprisingly, this has contributed to\nthe impoverishment and indebtedness of our farmers, pushing vast\nsections of them dangerously close to or even below the Poverty\nLine. According to the Planning Commission\u2019s own estimates, almost\n42 per cent of our rural population lives below the Poverty Line.\n\nNo less alarming is the fact that the number of our villagers\ndependent on per acre of land has been steadily increasing,\ncompared to other countries where this dependency has dramatically\ndecreased with governments investing in agro-industry which offers\nalternative sources of employment. No effort has been made to set\nup an adequate number of small-scale and cottage industries in our\nrural areas to absorb idle hands. This has also contributed in no\nsmall measure to the impoverishment of our farmers. In 1950-51,\nthe ratio of the disparity between the per capita income in rural and\nurban areas was 1:2; in 1995-96 it stood at 1:4. Similarly, while per\nfamily income has risen by 52 per cent in urban areas since 1952,\nit has increased by a mere 7.8 per cent in rural areas.\n\nIronically, these neglected villages form a vast market and from\nthis market, as much as Rs 48,000 crores flow to our urban areas\nevery year. By killing our villages, we will be destroying this market.\nConversely, by developing our villages, we will be strengthening\nthis market, which in turn will benefit our urban areas. In other\nwords, urban India cannot survive without rural India.\n\nBut this simple truth has been ignored for the last 50 years.\nToday, three out of every four Indians live in villages, condemned\nto a life of exploitation and increasing social, political and economic\nmarginalisation.\n\nUntitled-6 281 11/7/2016 8:39:44 PM\n\f\n282 * 1996 Manifesto\n\nBJP\u2019s Agenda For Our Farmers, Our Poor\n\nWe pledge to reverse this trend of social, political and economic\nmarginalisation of our rural population and empower our farmers.\nWe are committed to restoring agriculture to its rightful place\nand thus steering our people into an era of prosperity and social\nequality by the opening decade of the new century.\n\nNo country can be great if its people remain poor.

Implement a policy for improved cattle-breeding; and,\n\n3. Provide tax exemption to the income of Goshalas and\nPinjrapoles.\n\nThe BJP recognises the fact that from times immemorial, cow-\nprotection has remained one of the basics of Indian culture and\nIndian agriculture, and it is on the patient back of the cow and its\nprogeny that the entire structure of Indian agriculture rests. Over\n70 million animals are employed in farming operations in Indian\nvillages, more than 80% rural transport needs are met by the\nbullock-cart. Our livestock is also an effective protection against\nenvironmental degradation.\n\nThe BJP regretfully observes that millions of cows and cow\nprogeny are slaughtered every year, most of them for export.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-6 286 11/7/2016 8:39:45 PM\n\f\nOur Human Wealth\n\nLiteracy and Health For All\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party is committed to the creation of a Bharat\nwhose citizens will not suffer from the dual affliction of illiteracy and\nmalnutrition.

True development will be possible only when\nwe draw sustenance from our citizens; they are our true wealth.\n\nEducation\nThe past five years have witnessed this core area of human\nresource development being increasingly deprived of state support.\nAs a result, quality education is fast becoming the preserve of the\nsocial and economic elite of the country. The vast multitudes, who\nhave been victims of inequity, continue to be denied the cherished\nideal of literacy. The BJP will stress on providing equal opportunity\nof education, literacy and information.\nTowards this end, we will:\n1.

To ensure\nan equitable disbursement of resources so that the largest number\nof our people benefit from development policies, we must arrest the\ncountry\u2019s runaway population and growth. An increasing population\ncan only mean a decreasing share of the fruits of development.\nSuccessive Congress Governments have ignored this crucial area\nof development planning, often for petty political motives. This\nhas resulted in a steep rise in population and severe demographic\nimbalances. The Bharatiya Janata Party believes that children\nare born \u2014 and have the right \u2014 to be happy, and not merely\nfor existence. We will, therefore, put population-related issues,\nespecially family planning, firmly back on the national agenda, and\nlaunch a people\u2019s movement against the impending population\nexplosion through persuasive policies. The BJP proposes to:\n\n1. Act on the reports of the National Development Council\nand the Swaminathan Committee to formulate a National\nPopulation Policy that will stabilise the population growth\nby the first decade of the new century;\n\n2.

These disincentives will apply to all\nsections of society, irrespective of their social, economic or\nreligious status to discourage large, unsustainable families;\n\n4. Ensure universal access to family planning information\nand quality facilities by involving non-government\norganisations, and promote awareness among the people,\nespecially women, through counselling and educational\nprogrammes\n\n5. Introduce family planning methods and facilities that will\nallow women greater freedom of choice without imperilling\ntheir health;\n\n6. Launch a special campaign for women to seek about\nnegative practices and encourage reproductive health\nservices;\n\n7. Offer a special incentive in the form of a fixed deposit that\nwill mature in 21 years for those couples who have only\na girl child under a \u2018Dattak Putri Yojana\u2019.\n\n8.

This, however, is\nnot for endless exploitation. Our environment has to be protected,\nnot only to prevent the sanctity of Mother Earth from being\nprofaned but also because our forests, our rivers and our skies\nsustain a multitude of lives. No less important is the crucial role that\nenvironment plays in our nation\u2019s security. Environment must be\nprotected by subscribing to the concept of \u2018sustainable development\u2019,\na philosophical tenet that is integral to our civilisational and cultural\nconsciousness. The BJP will:\n\n1. Introduce a National Environment Policy incorporating\na healthy balance between development needs and\npreservation of natural resources.

A\nprogramme will also be drawn up for the conversion of\ndegraded forests, wasteland and marginal land into quality\nforests;\n\n13. Deny exploitation of offshore resources, especially marine\nlife, by big trawlers;\n\n14. Promote R&D in environment-related studies and eco-\ntechnology for application in agriculture, industry and\nthe services sector;\n\n15.

It rules out\ncontradictions between society and its various components, as also\nbetween society and the individual, or, for that matter, between\nthe family, the basic building brick of our social structure, and the\nindividual. From this stems the BJP\u2019s commitment to the eradication\nof social and economic disparities that have prevented India from\nemerging as a modern, dynamic nation; to the creation of a socially\nintegrated Bharatiya society which can proudly enter the new\ncentury.

Prevent land alienation through conversion of tribal lands\nfor industrial and other purposes;\n\n16. Formulate and implement a National Policy for the\nrehabilitation of families displaced by development\nprojects. This rehabilitation policy will be multi-dimensional\nand not merely provide financial compensation or\nmeans of livelihood. Governed by the principle of \u2018total\nrehabilitation\u2019, it will include social, economic, educational,\nenvironmental, occupational and cultural aspects.\n\n17. Encourage the setting up of inter-state regional coordination\ncouncils to implement a common welfare programme for\ntribals living in contiguous areas of neighbouring states.\n\n18. Erect a befitting memorial in honour of Maharishi Valmiki\nand Babasaheb Ambedkar in the national Capital.\n\nOur Socially and Educationally Backwards\n\nThe BJP is committed to providing both social and economic\njustice to the socially and educationally backward classes (Other\nBackward Classes) through the instrument of reservations. At the\n\nUntitled-6 299 11/7/2016 8:39:47 PM\n\f\n300 * 1996 Manifesto\n\nsame time, we hold that the path to progress of all sections of our\npeople lies not through social divisions brought about by casteist\npolitics but through social harmony. The BJP advocates:\n\n1. Continuation of reservations for the Other Backward\nClasses till they are socially and educationally integrated\nwith the rest of society;\n\n2. A uniform criterion for demarcating the \u2018creamy layer\u2019;\n\n3. Flow of reservation benefits in an ascending order so that\nthe most backward sections of the OBCs get them first;\n\n4. Ten per cent reservation on the basis of economic criteria\nto all economically weaker sections of society, apart from\nthe Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and the Other\nBackward Classes; and,\n\n5. Special programmes to provide education and vocational\ntraining as well as awareness campaigns.\n\nEnabling Our Disabled\n\nAs many as five crore of our people have been socially,\npolitically and economically marginalised because of their physical\nand other disabilities. Successive Congress governments have not\nonly abdicated their responsibility towards these less fortunate of\nour citizens, but also resisted their empowerment and, therefore,\ntheir inclusion in the national mainstream. The level of official\napathy can be gauged from the fact that during the last year of its\ntenure, the Rao Government allocated Rs 42 crore for the welfare\nof the disabled, which works out to Rs 8 per person.\n\nThe BJP believes that those who have been excluded from\nplaying a participatory role in the nation-building process by\nbeing stigmatised as \u2018disabled\u2019, should be empowered so that they\nbecome productive, proud citizens of our country. Towards this\nend, we propose to:\n\n1. Order a special survey to collect data about the number\nof people who are physically and otherwise disabled and\nthe nature of their disability;\n\n2. Use this data to formulate policies aimed at empowerment\n\nrather than merely welfare;\n. Actively campaign to remove social prejudices;\n4. Sensitise the bureaucracy to the needs and aspirations of\n\nOQ\n\nUntitled-6 300 11/7/2016 8:39:47 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 301\n\nthe disabled people;\n\n5. Provide employment in all suitable categories of government\nservice through a policy of equal opportunity;\n\n6. Give incentives to the private sector to provide disabled\npeople with job opportunities;\n\n7. Offer medical, counselling and rehabilitation facilities at\nhealth care centres by increasing budgetary allocation\nand encouraging state governments to make a matching\ncontribution; and,\n\n8. Ensure that disabled people have access to public utilities\nand services.\n\nOur Minorities\n\nWherever and whenever the Bharatiya Janata Party has been in\npower, it has ensured peace and security for all sections of society,\nirrespective of their religious identity. The BJP is committed to\nfurther strengthen this achievement. This is in stark contrast to the\ninsecurity faced by minority communities under Congress rule.\nWe have been steadfastly opposed to appeasement as state policy\nsince it benefits only those sections which profess regressive and\nretrograde social norms in the guise of protecting their religious\nbeliefs. The BJP will be guided by its policy of \u2018justice for all,\nappeasement of none\u2019. A resurgent India will enter the 21st century\nwith the resolve of one nation, one people and one culture. To\nachieve this goal, we will:\n\n1. Guarantee all minority communities equal opportunity\nfor economic development;\n\n2. Lay stress on education and vocational training;\n\n3. Provide incentives to those who are self-employed,\nespecially artisans, and those who want to set up their\nown business enterprise;\n\n4. Launch community programmes to create awareness\namong women members of minority communities;\n\n5. Ensure equality for all and discrimination against none on\ngrounds of religion in matters of education by amending\nArticle 30;\n\n6. Disband the Minorities Commission and entrust its\nresponsibilities to the National Human Rights Commission;\n\nUntitled-6 301 11/7/2016 8:39:48 PM\n\f\n302 * 1996 Manifesto\n\n7. Set up special courts for speedy trial of those accused of\nparticipating in communal riots;\n\n8. Protect wakf property from being usurped and misused\nby unscrupulous individuals and organisations and help\nwakf boards to become self-sustaining bodies so that they\ndo not have to be dependent on government doles;\n\n9. Set up trusts along the line of the Tirupati Temple Trust\nwith official nominees for managing the affairs of dargahs;\n\n10. Ensure that no religious property is misused or usurped;\n\n11. Ban all foreign funds irrespective of the organisation which\nis the recipient;\n\n12. Make fraudulent conversions, including those done by\nholding out the promise of economic or social benefits, to\npunishable offence and introduce a system of registering\nall conversions;\n\n13. Ban the publication of job advertisements that mention\nreligious identity as a criterion; and,\n\n14. Set up a Commission of Inquiry (similar to the Neogi\nCommission) to inquire into the activities of foreign\nmissionaries and other organisations that have been\nreceiving foreign funds.\n\nHuman Rights\nThe BJP subscribes to the view that human dignity, justice\nfor all and protection of the individual from the tyranny of the\nstate are among the basic tenets of Hindutva. We are committed\nto upholding the human, democratic and civil rights of every\nindividual, irrespective of the person\u2019s caste, creed, religion or\ngender. But, we will not allow this commitment to be used as a\nshield by those who commit inhuman atrocities and thus forsake\ntheir claim to human rights. The BJP believes that the state should\nbe fair to all citizens, but firm while dealing with those who militate\nagainst civil society. The BJP will not allow any foreign interference\nin our country\u2019s internal affairs on the pretext of monitoring human\nrights violations. We will:\n1. Strengthen the existing National Human Rights Commission\nthrough more powers, additional resources and better\ninfrastructural support;\n\nUntitled-6 302 11/7/2016 8:39:48 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 303\n\n2. Disband the Minorities Commission, which has only\nsucceeded in feeding separatist sentiments and giving rise\nto imagined grievances, and entrust its responsibilities to\nthe National Human Rights Commission;\n\n3. Take swift action on the basis of the Commissions findings\nand punish the guilty; and,\n\n4. Include the study of human, democratic and civil rights\nin school curricula.\n\nDisplaced Communities: Protecting their Rights\n\nSeparatist violence and Islamic fundamentalism/ terrorism in\nJammu and Kashmir has forced more than 300,000 people, including\n250,000 Kashmiri Pandits and Punjabi and Dogra Hindus, apart\nfrom thousands of Sikhs and even some Muslims, to flee their\nhomes and hearths. Most of the displaced Pandits are living in\nabysmal conditions in refugee camps in Jammu and other parts\nof the country. Together, they perhaps form the largest internally\ndisplaced community in the world, forced to live as refugees in\ntheir own motherland, condemned to the mercy of an uncaring\nand callous Congress government at the Centre and its puppet\nadministration in Jammu and Kashmir. The Bharatiya Janata Party\nhas mobilised its own resources, men and material to provide\nsuccour to these unfortunate victims of government apathy and\nterrorist violence. But a lot more needs to be done.\n\nSimilarly, thousands of Buddhist Chakmas have fled the\nChittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh in the face of persecution by\nMuslim settlers from the plains and the Bangladesh Rifles. Most of\nthem are at present living in camps in Tripura. Regardless of the\ngrim future that awaits them back home, the Government of India\nhas shown unnecessary haste in trying to repatriate them \u2014an action\nthat is largely motivated by the petty politics of the Congress. The\nBJP is opposed to such forced repatriation in the absence of foolproof\nsecurity guarantees from the Government of Bangladesh.\n\nThe escalating conflict in Sri Lanka between Sinhalese and\nTamils is posing a demographic threat to South India with a large\nnumber of Tamil refugees beginning to pour into this region. Such\na movement is bound to increase the influence of the LTTE which\nmay, in turn, promote separatist tendencies.\n\nUntitled-6 303 11/7/2016 8:39:48 PM\n\f\n304 \u00a9 1996 Manifesto\n\nWe must also address ourselves to the concerns of nonresident\nIndians, especially those who had settled in Hong Kong and now\nfind the future uncertain with Britain handing over this territory\nto China in 1997.\n\nThe BJP proposes:\nFor Kashmiri Pandits\n\n1. As urged by them for social cohesion and cultural\npreservation, designate the Pandits who have been\nforced out of Kashmir Valley as an internally displaced\ncommunity.\n\n2. Provide adequate financial relief, proper health, housing,\neducation and employment facilities on a priority basis to\nall displaced families.\n\n3. Take adequate steps to protect their assets and properties\nin Kashmir Valley till such time they are able to return\nhome.\n\n4. Elections in the Valley should be held only after the\ndisplaced people are able to return to their homes.\n\n5. Ensure proper documentation of the displaced Pandits\nand their assets.\n\nFor Chakma refugees\n\n1. Resettle Chakma refugees, the bulk of whom are at present\nin Tripura, in camps in other contiguous States and provide\nfinancial support to their governments so that they do not\nhave to take on the economic burden.\n\n2. Provide full citizenship to those Chakmas who do not\nwant to return to Bangladesh and whose children were\nborn in India.\n\n3. Negotiate with Bangladesh for the phased repatriation\nof those Chakmas who want to return, provided Dhaka\nguarantees their safety and well-being.\n\n4. Ensure full security for the Chakmas who live in refugee\ncamps so that they are not harassed or threatened.\n\n5. Maintain an official register of Chakma refugees and their\nwhereabouts.\n\nUntitled-6 304 11/7/2016 8:39:48 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 305\n\nFor Sri Lankan Tamil refugees\n\n1. House them in refugee camps and monitor their movements.\n\n2. Prevent their association with local organisations or opening\nlocal chapters of Sri Lankan organisations.\n\n3. Screen the antecedents of the Tamil refugees and disallow\nasylum to those who have or had links with Tamil terrorists.\n\n4, Maintain a register of all such refugees.\n\n5. Repatriate Tamil refugees as soon as the situation is\nconducive for their safe-being.\n\nFor non-resident Indians\n1.

It will\nredefine the concept of development to accommodate the Bharatiya\nway of living, belief system and values to reach the ultimate goal\nof Bharatiyata. We hold that it is necessary to emphasise the\nlinkage of development elements to cultural elements, including\nlocal relevance, relevance to geographical and environmental\nfactors, historical traditions, traditional knowledge and skills. We\nbelieve that cultural factors play an important role in energising\na nation. For a resurgent India whose people can proudly flaunt\ntheir Bharatiyata, the BJP will:\n\nUntitled-6 306\n\n1. Strengthen and revitalise our cultural institutions;\n\n2. Revive and rejuvenate our positive cultural traditions and\nvalues;\n\n3. Include Indian cultural studies and \u2018Naitik Siksha\u2019 as part\nof school curriculum;\n\n4. Establish a Bharatiya Sanskriti Kendra in each district;\n\n5. Declare all places of pilgrimage as national heritage centres;\n\n6. Encourage the study of Sanskrit and strictly enforce the\nthree-language formula in schools;\n\n7. Promote Bharatiya classical music and performing arts\nthrough state support; and,\n\n8. Discourage indecent representation of women in\nadvertisements and publications; young minds. Sex and\nviolence on the silver screen are beginning to gnaw at the\nmoorings of our cultural ethos.\n\nTo check this abuse of popular cinema, the BJP will:\n\n11/7/2016 8:39:48 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 307\n\n1. Provide film-making the status of industry so that producers\ncan be made accountable for their resources and expenses;\n\n2. Enable film-makers through suitable provisions in law\nto raise resources from financial institutions to curb the\ninfluence of underworld financiers and mafia dons;\n\n3. Analogous to the concept of the Customs \u2018green channel\u2019,\nprovide automatic certification for films which do not\ncontain explicit scenes and dialogues of violence and\nsexproducers and exhibitors of such films will not have to\nwait in the queue for Censor Board clearance. Deterrent\npunishment will be meted out to any producer who abuses\nthe facility; theatre owners who screen such films will also\nbe penalised;\n\n4. Exempt quality films, which will be certified as \u2018Q\u2019 from\nentertainment tax;\n\n5. Encourage viewers to form local Darshak Sanghs \u2014 on the\nlines of consumer organisations \u2014 to monitor the quality\nof films being screened in their area;\n\n6. Set up special theatres at district headquarters and\nmetropolitan cities for screening art and quality films;\n\n7. Appoint 50 per cent women on the Censor Board and\nCensor Panels;\n\n8. Create a special fund for promoting regional cinema; and,\n\n9.

We will aim\nat transforming Yuva Sankalpa into Yuva Shakti, which, in turn,\nwill be the catalyst for reinvigorating India.\n\nWe will inculcate in the country\u2019s youth a sense of pride in\nour ancient traditions and heritage. We will instil in them a sense\nof self-confidence so that they can take their rightful place in the\nvanguard of change.\n\nTowards this end, through its policies and programmes, the\nBJP will:\n\n1. Inculcate in the youth a sense of being indebted to society\nat large and thus prepare them to repay this debt by\ninvolving themselves in development programmes and\nsocial, cultural and economic activities;\n\n2. Initiate schemes both at Government and Non-Government\nlevels to achieve overall development of young talent;\n\n3. Mobilise the youth to fight regressive and retrograde\nsocial practices and customs by making community\nservice a compulsory and integral component of college\nand university curricula;\n\n4. Set up a National Youth Commission and a Youth\nDevelopment Bank to design and implement comprehensive\nemployment oriented education policies as well channelise\nyouth power for the purpose of nation-building;\n\n5.

The emphasis of our state\ngovernments, be it in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi or Maharashtra\n(where it shares power with the Shiv Sena), or earlier in Uttar\nPradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, has been on\nensuring peace, progress and prosperity.\n\nThe distinctive feature of our State Governments is their\nsingular achievement in curbing communal and caste conflict. This\nis in stark contrast to the situation that prevails in States ruled by\nthe Congress or the Janata Dal where the law and order machinery\nhas virtually collapsed. A shining example of our achievement on\nthis front is the communal peace that prevails in Maharashtra which\ntill recently was wracked by riots and social conflict. Similarly, the\nBJP government in Gujarat has ensured peace.\n\nThis has been achieved by cracking down on anti-social and\nanti-national activity. The underworld mafia, which flourished under\nCongress rule, has been brought to book. The criminal-politician\nnexus has been broken. Blackmarketeers, and other criminals, who\nsurvived because of Congress patronage, have been put behind\nbars or are facing prosecution.\n\nThe emphasis on enforcing law and order is not without reason.\nFor, unless there is peace, there cannot be progress and prosperity.\n\nIn the field of development, our state governments have\nfocused their attention on the rural sector, because the majority\nof our people live in the villages. Not only have effective steps\nbeen taken to solve the problems of our farmers, but innovative\n\nUntitled-6 310 11/7/2016 8:39:49 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 311\n\nschemes have been introduced to generate employment and fight\nthe scourge of poverty.\n\nFor instance, the BJP government in Rajasthan has earmarked\nmore than 60 % of Plan allocation for rural areas. As many as\n12.86 lakh farmers and artisans have benefited from the state\ngovernment's decision to write off loans amounting to more than\nRs 300 crores. The state government has also written off irrigation\nloans amounting to Rs 124 crores and introduced more effective\nmeans of irrigation. Tax relief on seeds, a wide range of agricultural\nproduce and equipment has further helped the farmers. Similarly,\nthe state government has reduced sales tax on fertlizers and made\na five-fold increase in agricultural loans.\n\nOn the social front, the government has introduced innovative\nschemes like Gopal Gram Yojana and Saraswati Yojana. The first\nscheme not only aims at improving the quality of livestock but also\nproviding people with a sustained income. Similarly, Saraswati\nYojana has a two-fold purpose: Universalising primary education\nand providing employment to the educated youth of the villages.\nSchemes like Shiksha Karmi Project and Guru-Mitra Yojana have\nalso contributed immensely to increasing literacy levels. Vikalp, a\nspecially designed family planning programme based on incentives\nand which protects the girl child, has been immensely successful.\n\nThe Rajasthan Government has also introduced a new industrial\npolicy to attract both Indian and foreign investors. The policy has\nalready begun to pay rich dividends. The government has signed\nMOUs for the setting up of new power plants. Soon, the state shall\nhave the largest solar power plant.\n\nIn Gujarat, the BJP government has maintained communal\nharmony in the trouble-prone areas. Latif, a notorious criminal\ninvolved in bootlegging and anti-social activities, has been put\nbehind bars. His underworld activities in the border areas of Kutch\nand Saurashtra have come to a grinding halt. Those involved in\nadulteration of petrol with solvents, which had become an extremely\nprofitable crime during Congress rule, are facing prosecution.\n\nWith law and order restored, the state government has turned\nits attention on development activity. Work on the Sardar Sarovar\nProject is progressing at a remarkable speed. Bonds worth Rs 300\ncrores were issued and the amount obtained in seven days from\n\nUntitled-6 311 11/7/2016 8:39:49 PM\n\f\n312 * 1996 Manifesto\n\nthe cooperative sector. Simultaneously, those displaced because\nof the project have been rehabilitated,\n\nOn the industrial front, the state government has adopted an\ninvestor-friendly policy which has evoked a tremendous response.\nAn increasing number of Non-Resident Indians have begun to\nshow keen interest in investing in Gujarat. At the same time,\nthe interests of the agricultural sector are not being ignored. For\ninstance, 42 % of the power generated in the state is channelised\nfor agricultural use, compared to 34 % for industry. New power\nplants are being commissioned to meet future requirements. In\nthe last three years of Congress rule, not a single MW was added\nto the installed capacity.\n\nOn the social front, the state government has reduced bus fares\nby 20%, a move which has brought tremendous relief to millions\nof people. Poor families are being provided with wheat at Rs 2 per\nkg. More than 40 lakh families have already been covered by this\npoverty alleviation scheme.\n\nThe biggest success of the Gujarat Government has been the\nGokul Gram Yojana, a scheme to develop the villages and provide\na better quality of life to villagers. The aim is to make the 18,090\nvillages of the State self-reliant and provide them with basic\nfacilities ranging from roads to drinking water to schools and proper\nsanitation. Since this is a participatory model of development, the\ngovernment has sought the people\u2019s participation. The response\nhas been tremendous: Even NRIs have come forward to contribute\nto the scheme.\n\nTo empower women, the state government has introduced\nschemes like Kuvarbai-nu-Mameru and Ghar Divda. Daughters of\npoor families receive financial support at the time of their marriage.\nTribal girls have been provided with bicycles so that they can attend\nschool. The Daridra Naray a Yojana has encouraged children from\npoor families to attend school. Under this scheme, children get free\nuniforms and books in addition to monetary incentives.\n\nOn the agricultural front, farmers are now allowed to buy\nland in any part of the state. New insurance policies have been\nintroduced to provide extensive cover. The quality of seeds,\npesticides and fertilizers has been improved and there has been\na three-fold increase in the allocation for drip irrigation. Farmers\n\nUntitled-6 312 11/7/2016 8:39:49 PM\n\f\n1996 Manifesto * 313\n\ntoday get adequate power supply.\n\nIn Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena-BJP Government has spared\nno effort to break the vicious grip which the mafia had established\nover the administration. The law and order machinery has been\nstrengthened and the police made accountable.\n\nIn Maharashtra, too, the emphasis has been on restoring law\nand order and implementing schemes aimed at providing a better\nquality of life for the people. This is most obvious in the rural areas\nwhere even small farmers today are provided with power for their\npumps and insurance cover for their crops. The government has\nundertaken a massive programme to provide drinking water to\nevery village.\n\nTo protect the poor from inflation, the state government has\nfrozen the prices of five essential commodities. The poorest of the\npoor are covered by the jhunka-bhakar scheme: For a rupee, a\nperson can have a meal. Those who cannot afford to pay for health\ncare, have been provided with free health services. Meritorious\nstudents from poor families are being provided with all incentives\nto ensure that they do not drop out of schools. A programme has\nbeen adopted to provide free housing to 40 lakh slum-dwellers in\nMumbai.\n\nThe state government has initiated steps to ensure that those\nwho perpetrate crimes against women are punished immediately.\nKamdhenu Yojana provides women with sustained employment.\nFor the girl child, a special scheme has been introduced to ensure\nthat her education and health care needs are taken care of. The\nMaharashtra Government has taken the first bold step to dismantle\nthe practice of polygamy.\n\nAbove all the state government has restored probity in public\nlife: They have provided the people with a clean and transparent\nadministration. The Enron deal was scrapped because the cost was\ninflated. A committee of experts renegotiated the deal with Enron\nand the new agreement has resulted in savings worth Rs 25,000\ncrores. The cost per unit of power has also been brought down by\n54 paise The biggest gain is that by bringing down the project cost,\nthe Maharashtra Government has set new parameters for power\nprojects elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe BJP Government in Delhi has achieved the unique\n\nUntitled-6 313 11/7/2016 8:39:49 PM\n\f\n314 * 1996 Manifesto\n\ndistinction of fulfilling 94 of the 100 promises which the party\nhad made within two years. This despite the fact that the state\ngovernment is hamstrung by restrictions imposed by the Union\nGovernment. The focus has been on improving the quality of life\nof a common man.\n\nThe BJP had promised that if voted to power, it would pursue\nthe prosecution of those involved in the November 1984 anti-Sikh\nriots. We are proud of the fact that our government has successfully\nreopened the investigations which were suppressed by the Congress.\nSome of the guilty people have been brought to book. The others\nwill also be brought to justice.\n\nThe BJP Government has provided Delhi with a corruption-free\nadministration. Several steps have been taken to end \u2018inspector raj\u2019\nand simplify rules and regulations. Schemes have bean introduced\nfor employment generation and to encourage entrepreneurs. Those\nliving in slums have been provided with basic amenities.\n\nThese are only some of our achievements, the highlights of our\ngovernments\u2019 performance. Much more remains to be done and we\nare committed to completing the task we have set for ourselves.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-6 314 11/7/2016 8:39:50 PM\n\f\nLet\u2019s Commence A New Chapter\n\nThis then is the blueprint which the Bharatiya Janata Party will\nimplement on coming to power. The task will be undertaken by\nthe party\u2019s inspiring team of leaders, each one of whom has an\nunmblemished record of self-less service to the nation. It is through\nthis blueprint that the BJP will bring about radical change in the\ncountry\u2019s polity, society and economy. It is this blueprint which\nwill be the bedrock of a new India where every citizen shall be free\nfrom fear, hunger and discrimination. This blueprint will pave the\nway to the next century and the new millennium.\n\nBut to implement our commitments we need your support. The\nsweeping change that has become so necessary to save the nation\ncan be brought about only with your help. To begin with, you\nhave to change the leadership at the helm of the country\u2019s affairs\nand vote out the Congress. The time has arrived for a nationalist\ngovernment which will lead India from the dark curse of poverty\nto prosperity; which will free the administration from the clutches\nof criminals and restore probity in public life; which will reinvest\nthe state with authority and strengthen our security forces; and,\nwhich will secure our country\u2019s frontiers so that we do not have\nto suffer once again the humiliations of this millennium. Such a\ngovernment can be provided only by the BJP.\n\nThe past five decades have been a tragic story of missed\nopportunities and self-serving opportunist politics. The Congress\nhas abused power and authority for the benefit of few and to the\ndetriment of millions of Indians. The leaders of the Janata Dal have\ndemonstrated their inability to think beyond themselves. The Left\nparties, orphaned by the passing away of Communism all over the\nworld, are struggling to come to terms with an ideological vacuum.\n\nUntitled-6 315 11/7/2016 8:39:50 PM\n\f\n316 * 1996 Manifesto\n\nNone of these parties can boast of ideological commitment, moral\ncourage and political conviction. On the other hand, the BJP has\nemerged as the only national alternative, a party that stands apart\nfor its ideology, commitment and courage.\n\nWe are standing at an important crossroad of our nation\u2019s\nhistory.

India has been credited to have developed, apart from philosophy and\nmathematics, science and technology of a very high order, which had attracted scholars from all over\nthe world. Al-Andalusi, a Spanish scholar in the 11th Century, in his monumental work 'Tabaqat al-\nUmam' had discussed the state of science in different countries. He writes, \"The first nation to have\ncultivated science is India... India is known for wisdom of its people. Over many centuries all the kings\nof the past have recognized the ability of Indians in all branches of knowledge.\" Andalusi further states,\n\"Indians, as known to all nations for many centuries, are the metal (essence) of wisdom, the source of\nfairness and objectivity. They are the people of sublime pensiveness, universal apologues, and useful\nand rare inventions.\"\n\nIndia's contribution to the march of civilization goes back to several thousand years before the Christian\nera. From the Vedas to Upanishads and Gautam - the Buddha and Mahavira - the 24th Jain Tirthankara\nand then to Kautilya and Chandra Gupta and down up to the eighteenth century, India was respected\nfor its flourishing economy, trade, commerce and culture. It had an international outreach from Korea\nto Arabia, from Bamiyan to Borobudur and beyond. Before the advent of Britishers, Indian goods were\ninternationally recognized for their quality and craftsmanship. India had a much bigger role and presence\nin industry and manufacturing than any nation in Europe or Asia. It had a well-developed banking\nsystem and equally renowned businessmen, along with its financiers, who were contributing to create\na flourishing and progressive economy. According to Sunderland, India was also one of the greatest\nshipbuilding nations and consequently had an access to international markets. Indian prosperity held\nthe world in thrall. lt was this wealth which attracted the foreigners - from Alexander to the Britishers.\n\nHistorical records establish the level of progress and prosperity attained by India before the advent of\nthe Europeans. Indian advancement in mathematics, astronomy, physics and chemistry along with\nthe biological sciences has been well recognized. India was a land of abundance, prosperity, affluence,\na land of sharing and caring living in perfect harmony and peace with the nature. From ancient times\nalmost all religions practiced in different parts of the world, have existed peacefully in India and will\ncontinue to do so. India thus provides the most ennobling experience in spiritual co-existence.\n\nBJP recognizes that no nation could chart out its domestic or foreign policies unless it has a clear\nunderstanding about itself, its history, its roots, its strengths and failings. In a highly mobile and\nglobalized world, it is imperative for a nation to know its roots that provide sustenance to its people. \\\n\nIndian freedom struggle, which was inspired by Tilak, Gandhi, Aurobindo, Patel, Bose and others, had\na clear vision of the civilizational consciousness of India. These leaders had directed the freedom\nmovement, keeping the Indian ways and thoughts in the centre of their action. They had a vision to\nreconstruct the political and economic institutions of India as a continuum of civilizational consciousness,\nwhich made India one country, one people, and one Nation.\n\nAfter achieving independence, the leaders at the helm of affairs lost the spirit and the vision, which the\nfreedom movement had evoked. They discarded the vision and adopted the institutional framework of\nadministration created by the Britishers which was quite alien to India's world-view. It is unfortunate\nthat these leaders could not comprehend India's inner vitality, which was the main force responsible for\nIndia's survival despite several attacks and prolonged foreign rule and thus, failed to rekindle the spirit\nof India.\n\n \n\f\nEven after nearly seven decades of our independence, the country has not been able to discover its\ninnate vitality, the sense of time and the will to act. As a result, in spite of being the oldest civilization\nand a young republic, we are engulfed by a multi-dimensional crisis. A crisis, which has encompassed\nall walks of life. The rising disparities, social and communal divide and terrorism leading to a fractured\nsociety, are worsening the situation rapidly. The present crisis is the result of this confusion and\ndisconnect from the seekings and sensibilities of the people. This is worse confounded by the weak\nand spineless leadership of the UPA Government. The tragedy is further heightened by their failure to\ndiagnose the malady and find the remedy. Instead of creating a socio-economic and political paradigm\nof governance drawn from the civilizational consciousness of India, the leaders tried to follow whatever\nwas being practiced in this or that western country.\n\nThus, we have wasted more than half of a century. Many other countries, even with smaller size and\nlesser resources, have surpassed us in development parameters. Another reason for this is that the\nGovernance in these decades was marred by lack of trust, leading to excessive controls. It was also\nmarked by lack of openness in Government and lack of people's participation. This has led to\nconcentration of power in a few hands and lack of transparency breeding corruption and nepotism on\na massive scale. The so-called \u2018liberalization\u2019 came in 1990s, but it was half-hearted. It didn't work\nbecause the rest of the eco-system remained the same. However, the beginning of the 21st century\nshowed some light under the NDA rule. India started being reckoned as an economic superpower. The\nsix-year rule of NDA had given the Nation many firsts, building an image in the International community.\nHowever, many of the hopes, potentials and projects have not been fully realized in the subsequent\nyears. But after 2004, UPAcame into power and the situation started worsening again. We missed a\nhistoric national opportunity once more.\n\nUPA's biggest blow to the Indian political system is that they have taken out Genuineness from\n\nGovernance; Authenticity from Administration. UPA has shown Governance of Enactment, not\nAction. It has given an Administration of Entitlement without Delivery. We have become a polity of\nPromises, and not Performance. We represent an economy of deficits, a work culture of delays\nand an asset base of deficiency. Worse, Congress-led UPA has made India a global synonym of\nCorruption, Scandal and Stagnation. To make it even worse, today, we are passing through total\nDecision and Policy Paralysis. Sluggish economic growth, unprecedented price rise and unstable\nCurrency are its most visible facets.\n\nThe following demand urgent solutions; economy including agriculture, energy, environment including\nnatural resources, education and health, employment, external and internal threats to security,\nempowerment, Governance, and erosion of moral and societal values.\n\nIf India has to survive as a nation, which it has to, in order to play its destined role in the comity of\nnations, if it has to make its voice heard for creating a peaceful and egalitarian world order, then we\nmust take up the challenges with urgency and determination and provide proper solutions for them. It\nis a pity that we have a demoralized leadership presiding over the state apparatus, which is incompetent\nto handle the present problems. What is needed today is to arrive at a consensus about the \u2018Idea\u2019 of\nIndia and also to think and redesign our approach in consonance with the seekings and preferences of\nthe Indian people.\n\nThe situation in the country is deteriorating rapidly. Delay in resolving the crisis would be dangerous.\nWhat is needed is to take lessons from history, recognise the vitality and resilience of India, the power\nof its world-view and utilize its strength, which drove it to glorious heights and analyse its weaknesses,\nwhich led to this abysmal fall. Pick up the thread from the point where the continuum of our civilizational\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat -Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nBJP\n\nconsciousness was lost and reorient the polity in consonance with those strong points of Indian\npsyche which will be the engine for our future glory. Let's keep the windows open, have a clear\nunderstanding of the global scenario and how without destroying our uniqueness we can assimilate\nthe best of the technological advancements.\n\nWe can achieve this goal provided the leaders seriously set to this task. What we need is a political\nparty committed to deliver and a leadership with strong determination and political will. As Vivekananda\nhad said, \"All power is within you. You can do anything. Believe in that.\" Yes, the power lies in the\npeople of India, in the inner sanctum sanctorum of Mother India. What is needed is to ignite the spark\nand Mother India would rise in her full glory.\n\nAs Sri Ma had once said that India had become the symbolic representation of all the difficulties of\nmodern mankind but India will also be the land of its resurrection to a higher and truer life. The BJP will\nleave no stone unturned to fulfill the dream of 1.22 billion Indians.\n\nToday, India is blessed with the rare capacity and opportunity of Democracy, Demography and\nDemand. If we are able to consolidate and harness them, we will be able to reach the heights which\nIndia deserves. The biggest reason for a sorry state of affairs is bad intentions on the part of those who\nhave ruled the country for sixty years. And that is where we would show the first difference. For BJP,\nthe goal of the policies and practices would be: Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat! The path would be:\nSabka Saath, Sabka Vikas. This is our commitment to the Nation and to the People.\n\nWith this determination of the party under the charismatic leadership of Shri Narendra Modi, we enter\nthe elections to the 16th Lok Sabha and would work whole-heartedly to give a stable, strong, visionary\nand progressive Government to India.\n\nItis an opportunity to change our fate and of our nation.\n\nGlory to Mother India, glory to Her children.\n\nDr. (Prof.) Murli Manohar Joshi\nChairman\nManifesto Committee -2014\nMarch 26, 2014\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nAttend the Imminent\n\nDecade under the UPA - | and II can rightly be summed in one line, the 'Decade of Decay\u2019, in which\nIndia had a free fall on all fronts - be it governance, economy, diplomacy, foreign policy, border safety,\netc. At the same time, corruption, scams and crime against women have reached to unacceptable\nlevels. There has been gross misuse and total denigration of government and institutions. There has\nalso been erosion of authority of the office of the Prime Minister. The Government dithered by each\npassing day, casting gloom and doom on the country that was once under the NDA regime called the\n\u2018Emerging Superpower\u2019. In 2004, NDA left the Government with a near double digit growth. The Congress-\nled UPA could not even maintain that growth and mismanaged the country so badly, that the growth\nrate declined to 4.8%, resulting the country falling ina deep mess. We have lost a wonderful opportunity\nand have pushed the country 20 years behind and rendered millions of men and women jobless.\n\nCritical and urgent challenges facing the nation have been left unaddressed. Beyond impacting the\nimmediate short-term, this is corroding the long-term potential of the nation. People feel frustrated and\nhave lost hope in the system. Things must change, and they must change now. BJP will take immediate\nand decisive action to address these issues on a priority basis.\n\nPrice Rise\n\nRunaway food inflation has crippled household budgets and contributed to the overall inflationary trend\nunder the Congress-led UPA's watch. Even worse, the food and nutritional security of millions is\nthreatened. However, the Congress-led UPA government has remained insensitive and indifferent to the\nplight of the people; tying itself into knots with short-term, mis-directed steps. The committee of Chief\nMinisters, headed by Shri Narendra Modi, has already submitted a report on food inflation in 2011. The\nreport was unfortunately not acted upon by the Congress-led UPA Government.\n\n \n\nThe BJP-led NDA Government's record of holding the prices is a demonstration of our commitment to\nbreak the vicious cycle of high inflation and high interest rates. Our immediate task will be to rein in\ninflation by several steps, such as:\n\ne putin place strict measures and special Courts to stop hoarding and black marketing.\nsetting up a Price Stabilisation Fund.\n\ne\ne unbundle FCI operations into procurement, storage and distribution for greater efficiency.\ne\n\nleverage on technology to disseminate Real time data, especially to farmers - on production,\nprices, imports, stocks and overall availability.\n\ne evolve a single 'National Agriculture Market\u2019.\ne@ promote and support area specific crops and vegetables linked to food habits of the people.\nEmployment and Entrepreneurship\n\nThe country has been dragged through 10 years of Jobless Growth by the Congress-led UPA\nGovernment. Under the broader economic revival, BJP will accord high priority to job creation and\nopportunities for entrepreneurship. We will:\n\n \n\ne strategically develop high impact domains like Labour-intensive manufacturing (viz. textile,\nfootwear, electronics assembly, etc.) and Tourism.\n\nstrengthen the traditional employment bases of agriculture and allied industries, and retail -\nthrough modernization as well as stronger credit and market linkages.\n\n \n\f\nBJP\n\nharness the opportunities provided by the upgradation of infrastructure and housing, for its job\ngenerating potential.\n\nencourage and empower our youth for self-employment - incubating entrepreneurship as well as\nfacilitating credit.\n\naddress the employability issue by initiating a multi-skills development programme in mission\nmode. Focus will be on job creation and entrepreneurship, in both rural and urban areas.\n\ntransform our Employment Exchanges into Career Centres - connecting our youth with job\nopportunities in a transparent and effective manner through the use of technology; as well as\nproviding counselling and training.\n\nCorruption\n\nCorruption is a manifestation of poor Governance. Moreover, it reflects the bad intentions of those\nsitting in power. All pervasive corruption under the Congress-led UPA has become a \u2018National\nCrisis\u2019.\n\nWe will establish a system, which eliminates the scope for corruption. We will do this through:\n\ne public awareness\n\ne technology enabled e-Governance - minimizing the discretion in the citizen-government interface.\n\ne system-based, policy-driven governance - making it transparent.\n\ne\n\nrationalization and simplification of the tax regime - which is currently repulsive for honest\ntax payers.\n\nsimplification of the processes and procedures at all levels - bestowing faith in the citizens,\ninstitutions and establishments.\n\n \n\nBlack Money\n\nBy minimizing the scope for corruption, we will ensure minimization of the generation of black money.\nBJP is committed to initiate the process of tracking down and bringing back black money stashed in\nforeign banks and offshore accounts. We will set up a Task Force for this purpose and to recommend\namendments to existing laws or enact new laws. The process of bringing back black money to India\nwhat belongs to India, will be put in motion on priority. We will also proactively engage with foreign\nGovernments to facilitate information sharing on black money.\n\nDecision and Policy Paralysis\n\nThe country has suffered a decade of maladministration and scams in addition to decision and policy\nparalysis; thus bringing growth and development to a grinding halt leading to a \u2018Governance deficit\u2019.\nThis situation will be changed and the engine of Government will be ignited again with strong willpower\nand commitment to public interest. We will also encourage the bureaucracy to take right decisions\nand contribute their might in building a modern India.\n\nPoor Delivery\n\n \n\n \n\nWherever we go, we encounter bottlenecks. We experience it on a daily basis - in government offices\nfor even the simplest of public services, in our courts buried in high pendency and so on. Similarly, we\nare known by a culture of missing links and lack of last mile connectivity. We have water but no\npipeline to carry it; we have schools but no teachers; we have computers and machines but no\nelectricity; we have scientists but no labs; we have instruments but no one to work on them. This\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat- Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nreduces the pace of our performance and results into wastage of time, money and energy. Intent to do\nthe right thing and the will to do things rightly, is missing. This has to be attended to on a priority basis.\n\nWhatever we do and provide for, the whole chain has to be kept in mind. With this in mind,\nwe will:\n\nremove bottlenecks and missing links in all sectors, activities and services.\n\nfocus on proper planning and execution for right outcomes.\n\nstrive for scale and speed with futuristic vision.\n\nBuild institutions for today and tomorrow.\n\nCredibility Crisis\n\nThe biggest challenge that India faces today is to restore the credibility of, and trust in the Union\nGovernment. In recent years, the Union Government has lost every semblance of credibility. Its intentions,\nintegrity and initiatives, all are questionable. The Congress party has not only lowered the dignity of the\nGovernment, but also the dignity of India. This is what is driving recent adversities like the falling rupee\nand countries riding roughshod over us. The BJP will work for restoring the trust and credibility of the\nGovernment. We will also ensure that the chain of responsibility and accountability is built in the\nsystem.\n\n \n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat -Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nBJP\n\nStrengthen the Framework\n\nTeam India\n\nCentre-State Relations\n\nIndia is a diverse country. Diverse communities settled in vastly different regions have their own aspirations.\nTaking these aspirations into consideration, the centre and the states therefore have to evolve a working\nsystem, which leads to harmonious relations. The genuine grievances of every state will be addressed\nin a comprehensive manner.\n\nWe will place Centre-State relations on an even keel through the process of consultation and strive\nfor harmonious Centre-State relations.\n\nOur Government will be an enabler and facilitator in the rapid progress of states. We will evolve a\nmodel of national development, which is driven by the states.\n\nTeam India shall not be limited to the Prime Minister led team sitting in Delhi, but will also include\nChief Ministers and other functionaries as equal partners.\n\nEnsure fiscal autonomy of States while urging financial discipline.\n\nCreate 'Regional Councils of States', with common problems and concerns, with a view to seeking\nsolutions that are applicable across a group of states.\n\nWe will encourage cooperation among states on security-related issues, inter-state disputes and\nfor removing inter-regional economic disparities and promoting tourism.\n\nWe recognize the special needs and unique problems of the hill and desert states. In consultation\nwith the Governments of these states, state-specific developmental priorities/ models will be evolved\nso that the aspirations of the people are met.\n\nGiven the unique status of Union Territories (UTs), they will receive special attention. We will focus\non developing and strengthening the economy of UTs. Tourism will be promoted, tribal welfare and\ntheir rights will receive full attention, and infrastructure and coastal area development will be given\ntop priority.\n\nWe reiterate our commitment to the protection and integrated development of our island territories.\n\nThe moribund forums like \u2018National Development Council\u2019 and Inter-State Council\u2019 will be revived\nand made into active bodies.\n\nInvolve the state Governments in the promotion of foreign trade and commerce.\nHelp the states mobilize resources through investments in industry, agriculture and infrastructure.\nIntegrating the Nation - Its Vastness and Voices\n\n \n\n \n\nIn ademocracy, everyone is not only free, but also encouraged to voice his or her concerns. It is also\nnecessary that these voices be heard and concerns redressed. However, all this should happen within\nthe framework of our constitution and with the spirit of India First\u2019. We have to keep the Nation at the\nforefront of our thoughts and actions. Any activity, which disrupts the integrity of the nation, cannot be\nin the interest of any segment of the society or any region of the country. All Indians living in different\nregions of the country have an equal stake in the progress of the country and they have to be assured\nof the fruits of the progress.\n\ne Presently, we see that there is a vast regional disparity between different regions of the country\n\n \n\f\nalong developmental parameters, particularly between the western part and the eastern part.\nDespite their richness in both natural as well as human resources, eastern part of India still lags\nbehind.\n\nWe shall give the highest priority towards bringing the eastern parts of the country on par with the\nwestern parts. To that extent, there shall be special focus and emphasis on the development of the\neastern side of India.\n\nGovernment will play the role of an enabler and a facilitator to the rapid progress of the states;\nplanning along regional aspirations, strengths and potentials, evolving appropriate strategies\nfor various zones of the country - hilly regions, plains, desert and coastal areas.\nRegional aspirations: BJP has always stood for greater decentralization through smaller States.\nNortheast : Resource rich North-Eastern states are lagging behind in development due to poor\ngovernance, systemic corruption and poor delivery of public services. NDA government had initiated\nconcrete steps to address the issue of development of Northeast by setting up the Ministry of North-\nEastern Region. We will empower this Ministry with a broader charter and non-lapsable funds for the\nrapid development of the region.\nBJP will:\nput special emphasis on enhancing the connectivity within the region and to the rest of the country.\nThere will be special emphasis on massive infrastructure development, especially along the Line\nof Actual Control in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim.\naddress the issue of Flood control in Assam and river water management.\nnurture more job generating opportunities like tourism and IT industry.\n\naddress the issue of infiltration and illegal immigrants in the Northeast region on a priority basis.\nThis will include clear policy directions and effective control at the ground level.\n\ncomplete all pending fencing work along the India-Bangladesh and India-Myanmar border, stepping\nup border security.\n\ntake measures for the safety of North-Eastern students studying across the country including\nsetting up Hostels for North-Eastern students at various educational centres.\n\ndeal with Insurgent groups with a firm hand.\n\nJammu and Kashmir: Jammu and Kashmir was, is and shall remain an integral part of the Union of\nIndia. The territorial integrity of India is inviolable. BUP will pursue an agenda of equal and rapid\ndevelopment in all the three regions of the state - Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.\n\nThe return of Kashmiri Pandits to the land of their ancestors with full dignity, security and assured\nlivelihood will figure high on the BJP's agenda.\n\nThe long pending problems and demands of refugees from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK) will\nbe addressed.\n\nBJP reiterates its stand on the Article 370, and will discuss this with all stakeholders and remains\ncommitted to the abrogation of this article.\n\nAll steps will be taken to provide good governance, better infrastructure, educational opportunities,\nhealthcare and more job opportunities, leading to a better quality of life in the valley.\n\nSeemandhra and Telangana: BJP is committed to do full justice to Seemandhra, and address the\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat -Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nBJP\n\nissues of development and governance of Seemandhra and Telangana.\nDecentralization and People's Participation\nFrom Representative to Participatory Democracy\n\n \n\nIndia is a country of immense diversity - a highly decentralized federal structure is thus crucial in\nmeeting the varied ideas and aspirations of our diverse people. Power is currently concentrated in\nDelhi and the State capitals. We believe this power should be genuinely decentralized. BJP has stood\nfor greater decentralization through devolving of powers to the states. A vast reservoir of People's\nPower has not yet been tested in the real sense. We have not been able to involve the people in\nGovernance as functionaries and facilitators.\n\ne People's Participation: Our developmental process will be a people's movement - of Jan bhagidari.\nWe will make them the active drivers of development rather than mere passive recipients.\n\nPeople's Engagement: Through Pro-active, Pro-people Good Governance, we will ensure the\nGovernment itself directly reaches out to the people, especially the weak and marginalized sections\nof society.\n\nWe will further evolve the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model into a People-Public-Private\nPartnership (PPPP) model.\n\nBJP is committed to strengthen self-Governance at the local level and we will empower Panchayati\nRaj Institutions with extensive devolution of the 3 Fs - Functions, Functionaries and Funds.\n\nGood performers amongst the Panchayats will be rewarded with additional developmental grants.\n\nStrengthen the institution of the Gram Sabha, respecting their inputs and initiatives for development\nprocess.\n\nWe will actively involve people in policy formulation and evaluation through various platforms.\n\nWe will encourage Openness in the Government, involving all stakeholders in the decision-making\nprocesses.\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nReform the System\n\nGood Governance: Transparent, Effective, Involving and Encouraging\n\nIndia First\n\nBJP believes in India being one country, one people and one nation. BUP recognizes the importance of\ndiversity in Indian society, and the strength and vibrancy it adds to the nation. The party believes in the\nprinciple of unity in diversity.\n\nIndia constitutes of all its' people, irrespective of caste, creed, religion or sex. It constitutes of all the\ncommunities - ethnic, social and cultural groups and also our culture, which is defined by tolerance\nand co-existence. The hallmark of India is \"Unity in Diversity\". It constitutes of each and every inch of\nour land, its natural resources and mental and physical energy we possess. It constitutes of all the\ninstitutions made in the past and present.\n\nIndia First simply means nurturing and protecting all the elements, which India is made of. It does not\nexclude anyone or anything - it only includes everything and everyone, which India is made of. It is\ncomplete India; without exclusion, without exception. It also means that whatever is in the interest of\nIndia will be in the interest of all the elements that India is made up of, including its citizens.\n\nThe counter to the concept of \u2018India First\u2019 is what is happening today; appeasement of one, at the cost\nof the other, using Institutions for protecting the interest of a particular party or persons. It is reflected\nin the thinking that whatever is not in the interest of a party is not in the interest of India. Clearly,\nGovernance on these lines is not in the interest of India.\n\nSimply speaking, \u2018India First\u2019 puts the national interest first while taking any decision or step both by\nGovernments and citizens. Even more simply put, you have to just see the face of India and Indians\nwhen you are in doubt. This is what separates 'India First' from the present day politics and Governance\nof the Congress-led UPA.\nFor BJP:\n\nthe only philosophy and religion of a Government should be India First.\n\nthe only epic of a Government should be India's Constitution.\n\nthe only power of a Government should be the power of the people.\n\nthe only prayer of a Government should be the welfare of its people.\ne the only way of a Government should be 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas\u2019.\n\nOpen Government and Accountable Administration\n\nAdministrative reforms will be a priority for the BJP. Hence, we propose to implement them through an\nappropriate body under the PMO. The objective will be to bring in transparency in Government's decision-\nmaking process. Government systems and processes would be relooked to make them citizen friendly,\ncorruption free and accountable.

Our administrative set up should\nbe people-centric, responsive and result-oriented. With this in mind, we are committed to bring the\nfollowing reforms:\n\nthe administration and its members will be made truly accountable to their tasks as well as the\npeople through rigorous evaluation process.\n\n \n\ngood performance will be rewarded; non-performers will be given opportunities and training support\nto improve.\n\nrationalization and convergence among the Ministries, departments and other arms of the\nGovernment will be ensured to focus on delivery.\n\nopen up government to draw expertise from the industry, academia and society.\n\nservices of youth in particular will be tapped to contribute in governance with Fellowship and\nInternship programmes launched at various levels.\nJudicial\nBJP is committed to ensure Justice for All - justice which is prompt and accessible.

The BJP will seek, through\nconsultation with other parties, to evolve a method of holding Assembly and Lok Sabha elections\nsimultaneously. Apart from reducing election expenses for both political parties and Government, this\nwill ensure certain stability for State Governments. We will also look at revising expenditure limits\nrealistically.\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat -Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nBJP\nWiden the Platform\n\nCertain segments of India have been historically disadvantaged. Due to a lopsided development approach\nand skewed allocation of resources, they continue to lag behind the rest of the country in socio-\neconomic indicators in spite of having abundant natural resources and talent. Consequently, our\ndemographic dividend is not being fully actualized. It is the duty of the government to enable every\nIndian to realize his or her full potential, ensuring equitable growth and development. We are committed\ntowards this end, and will ensure the same by:\n\ne Empowering each and every Indian through health and education.\n\ne Increasing Opportunities by making Job creation central to our economic model.\n\ne Ensuring a basic level of Infrastructure to all - Home, Electricity, Water, Toilets and Access.\nPoor and Marginalized - Bridge the Gap\n\nOur Government will be a government of the poor, marginalized and left behind. Every Indian\nhas a right over everything that India has. From this, he or she is free to weave his or her own dreams.\nThe India of tomorrow will have 125 crore such dreams, and will be built on the same. We will not only\nempower our citizens with the ability to dream; we will enable them with the capability to actualize\ntheir dreams.\n\n \n\nThe real test of the success of a development process lies in the happiness of the common man. The\nfruits of growth and development must reach the weakest, most deprived and remotest of people. With\nfirm belief in the concept of Antyodaya - uplifting the poorest of the poor - Extreme Poverty and\nmalnutrition will be treated as a National priority, and will be addressed on Mission Mode.\n\nWe will:\n\ne strengthen Delivery of poverty alleviation programs through convergence, transparency and\nefficiency.\nidentify 100 most backward districts of the country to bring them at par with other districts\nthrough prioritized and integrated development.\nstrengthen the natural resource base of the people to tide over natural calamities.\naim to gainfully employ rural poor in agriculture and allied activities.\nenable the urban poor to develop skills so that they take advantage of the emerging opportunities.\n\nfacilitate partnership across all levels of government, civil society, academic and financial institutions\nin this national mission of poverty alleviation.\n\nFood Security\n\nBJP has always held that 'universal food security\u2019 is integral to national security. BUP will take steps to\nensure that the benefits of the scheme reach the common man and that the right to food does not\nremain an act on paper or a political rhetoric. BJP will review all the laws and schemes, in consultation\nwith the states, to ensure a corruption-free efficient implementation of food security, which would be a\npriority.\n\nBJP will:\\\n\ne review the successful PDS models, and incorporate the best practices to revise the existing PDS,\nfor benefitting the common man.\n\n \n\f\naddress the issue of under-nutrition and malnutrition.\n\nencourage the production of cereals, pulses and oils.\n\nradically transform the Food Corporation of India (FCl).\n\nensure contingency stocks for any exigencies arising due to natural calamities or external factors.\nseek the participation of voluntary organizations in running community kitchens.\n\nSCs, STs, OBCs and Other Weaker Sections - Social Justice and Empowerment\n\nThe BJP is committed to bridge the gap, following the principles of Samajik Nyay (social justice) and\nSamajik Samrasata (social harmony). This social justice must be further complemented with economic\njustice and political empowerment. Instead of pursuing identity politics and tokenisms, we will\nfocus on empowering the deprived sections of society. Steps will be taken to create an enabling\necosystem of equal opportunity - for education, health and livelihood. We will accord highest priority\nto ensuring their security, especially the prevention of atrocities against SCs & STs.\n\n \n\nWe believe that accelerated social justice and integrated developmentis the key to the progress of our\ncountry and success of our democracy. The BJP is committed to bridge the divide following the\nprinciple of social justice (Samajik Nyay) and social harmony (Samajik Samrasata). Instead of pursuing\nidentity politics and tokenisms, which have not led to any tangible results for the SC, ST, OBCs and\nother weaker sections of our society, the BUP will focus on tangible development and empowerment.\n\ne Ahigh priority for SC, ST, OBCs and other weaker sections would be to create an ecosystem for\neducation and entrepreneurship.\n\nBJP is committed to the eradication of untouchability at all levels.\nBJP is committed to eliminate manual scavenging.\nBJP will look at more effective ways to pull these people out of the poverty line.\n\nBJP will ensure that the funds allocated for schemes and programmes for SC, ST, OBCs and other\nweaker sections are utilized properly.\n\nA mission mode project would be made for housing, education, health and skills development.\nSpecial focus would be on the children, especially the girl child, with regards to health, education\nand skills development.\n\nTribal development will be one of the focus areas. BJP believes that half-hearted, incremental and\npiecemeal attempts for the development of tribals have not helped. So the BJP commits to make a\ncomprehensive, all-encompassing long-term strategy to empower tribals and ensure their welfare. The\ngoal would be to ensure tribal development while preserving the unique identities of this community.\nThe Governments of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have successfully implemented the\ntribal welfare and development schemes and their model would be used for tribal welfare and development.\n\nBJP will initiate a 'Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojna' at the national level to be overseen by a 'Tribal Development\nAuthority\u2019. This scheme will focus on:\n\ne Setting up the entire education network for tribals.\nUpgrading housing, water and health facilities.\n\ne\ne Electrification of tribal hamlets and provision of all - weather roads.\ne\n\nInitiating new economic activities.\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat -Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nBJP\n\nPromoting the products associated with the tribal culture by setting tribal haats in tourist towns\nand other centres.\n\nEnsure that the tribal land is not alienated.\nFacilitating access to minor forest produce and creating a network of rural haats (markets).\n\nEstablishing the National Centre for Tribal Research and Culture to preserve the tribal culture and\nlanguages.\n\nEnhancing the funds for tribal welfare and development.\nMinorities - Equal Opportunity\n\nBJP believes that in India's 'Unity in Diversity\u2019 lies India's biggest strength. We cherish the depth and\nvibrancy that the diversity in Indian society adds to the nation. BUP is thus committed to the preservation\nof the rich culture and heritage of India's minority communities; alongside their social and economic\nempowerment.\n\n \n\nIt is unfortunate that even after several decades of independence, a large section of the minority, and\nespecially Muslim community continues to be stymied in poverty. Modern India must be a nation of\nequal opportunity. BUP is committed to ensure that all communities are equal partners in India's\nprogress, as we believe India cannot progress if any segment of Indians is left behind.\nWe will:\n\nEnsure that the young, and the girl child in particular get education and jobs without discrimination.\n\nStrengthen and modernize minority educational systems and institutions; dovetailing them with\nmodern requirements. National Madrasa modernization programme would be initiated.\n\nEmpower with vibrancy in Livelihood and Entrepreneurial opportunities.\n\nAugment their traditional artisanship and entrepreneurial skill, which are a backbone of our cottage\nand small-scale industry - strengthening these sectors through better market linkages, branding\nand access to credit.\n\nEmpower Waqaf Boards in consultation with religious leaders; taking steps to remove encroachments\nfrom and unauthorized occupation of Waqf properties.\n\nCurate their rich heritage and culture - maintenance and restoration of heritage sites; digitization\nof archives; preservation and promotion of Urdu.\n\nEnsure a peaceful and secure environment, where there is no place for either the perpetrators or\nexploiters of fear.\n\nFacilitate the setting up of a permanent Inter-faith Consultative mechanism to promote harmony\nand trust, under the auspices of religious leaders.\n\nNeo-Middle Class - Meet their Aspirations\n\nIndia has a large middle class with immense understanding, talent and purchasing power. In addition,\na whole new class has emerged. Those who have risen from the category of poor and are yet to\nstabilize in the middle class, the 'neo middle class\u2019. This class needs proactive handholding. Having\nmoved out of poverty, their aspirations have increased. They want amenities and services of a certain\nstandard. They thus now feel that Government facilities and services are not up to the mark, and hence\nresort to the private sector for things like education, health and transport. This is obviously costly,\nputting the neo middle class into a daily dilemma. As more and more people move into this category,\n\n \n\n17\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\ntheir expectations for better public services have to be met. We have to strengthen the Public Sector\nfor providing efficient services to our citizens. In particular attention will be paid on government providing:\n\ne Educational scholarships and educational facilities.\ne Medical insurance and quality healthcare services.\ne Middle-income housing.\n\nEfficient public transport systems.\nRural Areas - High Priority\n\nTwo-thirds of our people live in villages. Lack of amenities to live and opportunities to work, however, are\nrestricting our rural life. Both these factors are the result of prolonged neglect. A full-fledged programme\nfor 'Rural Rejuvenation\u2019 will be made and implemented which will comprise of integrated strategies for\npersonal, economic and social well being of the villagers. Through the idea of Rurban, we will bring\nurban amenities to our rural areas, while retaining the soul of the village.\n\n \n\nAgriculture, rural development and poverty alleviation go hand in hand. Major thrust area for rural\ndevelopment would be to improve village level infrastructure in terms of roads, potable water, education,\nhealth, supply chain, electricity, broadband, job creation, security in rural areas and linkage to markets.\n\nUrban Areas - High Growth Centres\n\nMore than one-third of our population is already living in our cities and towns. Soon, the urban areas\nwill cover half our people. Moreover, our cities should no longer remain a reflection of poverty and\nbottlenecks. Rather they should become symbols of efficiency, speed and scale.\n\nWe will look at urbanisation as an Opportunity rather than a Threat.\nMajor steps will be undertaken in Transport and Housing for 'Urban Upliftment' in India.\n\n \n\nWe will initiate building 100 new cities; enabled with the latest in technology and infrastructure -\nadhering to concepts like sustainability, walk to work etc, and focused on specialized domains.\n\nThe approach to urban development will be based on integrated habitat development - building on\nconcepts like Twin cities and Satellite towns.\n\nUpgrade existing urban centres, transitioning focus from basic infrastructure to public utility services\nlike Waste and Water Management - for a clean and healthy city life.\n\nCleanliness and Sanitation will be given priority - efficient Waste and Water management systems\nwill be set up. Model towns will be identified for rolling out integrated waste management\ninfrastructure.\n\nWi-Fi facilities will be made available in public places and commercial centres.\n\nUrban poverty alleviation scheme would be a key thrust area.\n\nUse technology for scientific, strategic and long term town planning - including GIS based mapping.\nBuild quality integrated Public Transport systems, discouraging usage of private vehicles.\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat -Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nBJP\n\nLeap Forward\n\nWe have to give the taste of a developed country to this very generation. We have to take a quantitative\nand qualitative leap. The time of knee jerk reactions and incremental changes has gone. What we\nneed is a quantum jump and a total change. We also believe that development has to be holistic,\nuniform and all pervasive. Further, we have to make the people active partners in whatever is happening\nand empower them to take advantage of the development process. We will make an effort that government\nwithdraws from those services which could be done by others and devote that extra time, money and\nenergy for social sectors, particularly for development of the weaker sections. And a common thread\nwill run across all our ideas and initiatives. This common thread is the wire and wave of Technology -\nmaximum application of technology for making governance easy, economical and effective.\n\nSocial Security - A Caring Government, Passionate Society\n\nIndia has always been a caring society. It is in our culture to help the aged, the weak and the helpless.\nWe have to retain this. We have to educate our younger generations about this. The social security\nschemes of the Governments have to be made more meaningful. Our aspirations get frustrated when\nwe encounter a weak social infrastructure. We need it on a daily basis.\n\nChildren - the Future of the Nation\n\n\"There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children\" -\nNelson Mandela\n\n \n\nIndicators related to children welfare are an indicator of the progress of the nation, be it health, education\nor safety of children. Under the UPA rule, the same has not been given its due weightage. BJP is\ncommitted to address the issues related to children, like malnutrition and under-nutrition, problem of\nchild labour, child-trafficking and missing children, sexual abuse, school dropouts and the increasing\ncrime rate among juveniles. BJP will take the following steps to ensure survival, development, participation\nand protection of children:\n\nLay special emphasis on vulnerable children and especially those belonging to the vulnerable\ncommunities like SCs, STs, OBCs, migrants, slum dwellers, street dwellers and those with\ndisabilities.\n\nEnsure effective implementation of the Right to Education, Right to Food Security Act.\n\nReview, amend and strengthen the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act,\n2012 and Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS).\n\nFocused efforts will be made to address issue of anaemia.\nReduce the burden of books on children without compromising on the quality of education.\nEndeavour to inculcate values amongst children.\n\nSenior Citizens\n\nBJP is committed to the welfare of senior citizens, especially their security and health care. We will\ntake measures to deal with the issues related to the senior citizens in a focused manner.\n\nBJP will:\n\ne Provide financial support, exploring ideas like additional tax benefits and higher interest rates.\n\ne Investin setting up and improving old-age homes.\ne Harness their experience in the National Interest. Devise schemes and programs to engage the\n\n19\n\n \n\f\nsenior citizens as volunteers / part time workers in various development programmes of the\n\ngovernment, in urban and rural areas. This will not only help in utilizing their time, but also it would\n\nbe an effective utilization of their experience and may add an additional source of income for them.\nSpecially Abled\n\nAbout 70 million people are suffering from disability, and BJP considers it a serious neglect. The\nwelfare and rehabilitation of disabled people is integral to our vision of a caring society and that of a\nresponsive government. The BUP commits to:\n\nEnact the 'Rights of the Persons with Disabilities bill\u2019 (RPWD).\n\nUse technology to deliver low cost quality education to specially-abled students 'in-home' - through\nE-learning.\n\nIdentify each and every special needs person across the country - establishing a web based\ndisability registration system to issue universal ID for all applicable government benefits (healthcare,\ntransportation, jobs, education etc).\n\nEnsure disabled friendly access to public facilities, public buildings and transport.\n\nEnsure maximum economic independence of the disabled by creating more income generation\nmodels for them.\n\nSupport and aid voluntary organizations working for the care of the disabled.\nProvide a higher tax relief for the family member taking care of the disabled.\nYouth - Making India Unstoppable\n\n\u2018Young men, my hope is in you. Will you respond to the call of your nation? Each one of you has a\nglorious future if you dare believe me. Have a tremendous faith in yourselves, like the faith | had when\n| was a child, and which | am working out now. Have that faith, each one of you, in yourself-that eternal\npower is lodged in every soul-and you will revive the whole of the country.\u2019 - Swami Vivekananda\n\n \n\nBJP considers youth as the most productive asset of the nation who have played a key role in taking\nthe country to a near double digit growth. All sectors dominated by youth are doing exceptionally well.\nIndia is the oldest civilization but the youngest country and this necessitates that the policies must be\nbased on the judicious mix of experience of energy, and be \"Youth inclusive\u2019, so that youth are an\nintegral part of the development process. We commit to review and revise policies to seek participation\nof youth in decision-making and nation building process and actively get the youth to participate in\ndecision-making bodies.\n\nwe will initiate the \"Young Leaders programme\u2019 in all sectors, to recognize, reward and involve\nthese exceptionally talented youth to serve as role models and mentors for others.\n\nset up the National Youth Advisory Council.\n\nBJP will initiate nation-wide \u2018district level incubation and accelerator programme\u2019 for encouraging\ninnovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nprocedure to avail Student's loans will be simplified and loans made affordable.\n\nset up neighbourhood Children's/ Youth Parliament across India that leads to vibrant student\ncommittees.\n\nWill launch a programme, 'Youth for Development\u2019.\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat -Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nPromotion of Sports\nBJP recognizes the importance of sports in society and for all age groups. Sports have a direct relation\nto fitness, good health and productivity. India has not fared well in sports, and needs to invest for\npromotion of sports in an organized manner.\n\nBJP will promote all sports - traditional and modern.\n\nMore funds will be allocated to sports, and we will encourage the State Governments to fully\ndischarge their responsibility in the promotion of sports.\n\nSteps would be taken to inculcate a culture of sports at the school level by arranging sports\nfacilities and training needs for promoting a healthy lifestyle, and making sports as a compulsory\npart of the school curriculum.\n\nLaunch a \u2018National Sports Talent Search System\u2019, so that extraordinary sporting talent is identified\nat a very young age. Such promising boys and girls will be selected for special training. The\nexisting rural sports programme and National Women Sports Festival will be broadened to reach\nevery village and to identify talent for nurturing and excellence development.\n\nAttractive career path needs to be planned for sportspersons providing security of career through\njobs in government, PSUs and private sector.\n\nEstablish sports academies across the country.\nSpecial scheme would be devised for sportspersons to ensure social security.\nEncourage business houses to patronize sports and sportspersons.\n\nMandate all new housing colonies to include sports facilities.\nWomen - The Nation Builder\n\n \n\nBJP recognizes the important role of women in development of the society and growth of the nation,\nand remains committed to give a high priority to Women's Empowerment and welfare. BUP ruled\nstates have demonstrated this through various schemes. BJP also recognizes the need for women's\nsecurity as a precondition to women's empowerment and will undertake the following for women welfare:\n\ne Women's welfare and development will be accorded a high priority at all levels within the government,\nand BJP is committed to 33% reservation in parliamentary and state assemblies through a\nconstitutional amendment.\n\nLaunch a national campaign for saving the girl child and educating her - Beti Bachao - Beti\nPadhao.\n\nStructure a comprehensive scheme, incorporating best practices from past successes like Balika\nSamruddhi, Ladli Laxmi and Chiranjeevi Yojana to support encourage positive attitude amongst\nfamilies towards the girl child.\n\nProgram for women healthcare in a mission mode, especially focusing on domains of Nutrition\nand Pregnancy - with emphasis on rural, SCs, STs and OBCs.\n\nWe will enable women with training and skills - setting up dedicated Women ITIs, Women wings\nin other ITls.\n\nStrict implementation of laws related to women, particularly those related to rape.\n\nFund for relief and rehabilitation of rape victims lies unused at the Centre as the Government has\nnot worked out the modalities of dispensation. BUP will clear this on priority.\n\n21\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nGovernment will create an Acid Attack victims welfare fund to take care of the medical costs\nrelated to treatment and cosmetic reconstructive surgeries of such victims.\n\nMake police stations women friendly, and increase the number of women in police at different\nlevels.\n\nIntroduce self defence as a part of the school curriculum.\n\nUsing information technology for women's safety.\n\nSet up an All Women Mobile Bank to cater to women.\n\nSpecial skills training and business incubator park for women.\n\nSetting up special business facilitation center for women.\n\nExpand and improve upon the network of women / working women hostels.\n\nSet up a dedicated W-SME (Women Small and medium enterprises) cluster in every district.\nReview the working conditions and enhance the remuneration of Anganwadi worker's.\n\nRemove any remaining gender disparities in property rights, marital rights and cohabitation rights.\n\nSpecial adult literacy initiative would be started for women with focus on SCs, STs, OBCs, and\nslum residents.\n\nWill ensure that the loans to Women Self Help Groups would be available at low interest rates.\nSpecial programs aimed at girls below poverty line, tribals and indigent women.\n\nAppropriate measures would be taken to check female foeticide, dowry, child marriage, trafficking,\nsexual harassment, rape and family violence.\n\nWe will transform the quality of life of women in Rural India by providing electricity, tapped water,\ncleaner fuel and toilets in every home.\n\nEducation - Enroll and Excel\n\nBJP believes that education is the most powerful tool for the advancement of the nation and the most\npotent weapon to fight poverty. Education in India needs to be revitalized and reorganized to make\nfuture generations proud of their culture, heritage and history and also for creating confidence in the\nvitality of India. Every effort shall be made to ensure \u2018equality of opportunity in access and success' to\nall learners; creating a harmonious, and cohesive egalitarian society that practices democratic values.\nThis would be possible only when Education accords due emphasis on national integration, social\ncohesion, religious amity, national identity and patriotism. It must also be analyzed how far education\nhas contributed to moral, ethical and humanistic values in the individuals and the society.\n\n \n\nEducation must create minds free from superstitions, hatred and violence and become an important\nvehicle to cement national unity, social cohesion and religious amity. Our endeavour should be to\ninculcate moral, ethical and humanistic values in the individuals and the society.\n\nIndia has to become a knowledge society and has to reverberate with educated skilled manpower of\nhigh standards required to meet the challenges of 21st century. This requires a bold and visionary\nleadership to introduce appropriate policy and structural changes.\n\nHighest priority would be given to address the acute shortage of teachers and researchers, quality of\neducation and research, and also the employability factor associated with most of the courses.

Our science and technology policy will be framed and implemented so\nas to be in harmony with our worldview of the large human family. We will ensure that science and\ntechnology truly uplifts the Indian people and indeed all humanity.\n\nFlora, Fauna and Environment - Safeguarding Our Tomorrow\n\nThe present generation has to make this world a better place to live. Abetter place not only for us, but\nfor our future generations as well. We have to nurture the environment, institutions, people, resources\nand amenities. We have to combine the past, the present and the future. We have to have a holistic\nview of human life for sustainable development.\n\n \n\nWe have to develop the assets and amenities for ourselves in a manner that leaves an equally good or\neven better environment for the future generations. We will put sustainability at the centre of our\nthoughts and actions, working on the principle that inclusive growth cannot be limited by the barriers of\ntime and space - it has to be built on the foundations of the past, leverage on the opportunities of the\npresent, and preserve and enhance its resources for the future. We will take Climate Change mitigation\ninitiatives with all seriousness and work with the global community and institutions in this regard.\n\nWe will:\ne Encourage Cleaner production.\nCleaner fuels will be promoted so as to bring down the pollution levels particularly in the cities.\n\ne\ne The concept of pro-active 'Carbon Credit' will be promoted.\ne\n\nEcological Audit of projects and pollution indexing of cities and townships will be done on\nscientific basis.\n\nPollution control mechanisms will be set up on priority basis.\n\nIn addition to protecting the existing forests and wildlife reserves, the wastelands of the country\nwill be used for social forestry.\n\nGuidelines for Green buildings and energy efficient work places will be brought out.\nR&D and Human Resource Development in Environment Technology will be promoted.\nSet up fool proof mechanisms for protection and preservation of wild life.\n\nEncourage citizen's participation in reforestation, agro-forestry and social forestry, through targeted\nprogrammes.\n\nEncourage and incentivize innovative garbage disposal and waste management practices, especially\nrecycling techniques.\n\nThe Himalayas\nBJP is committed to serious endeavors for creating a global awareness regarding the conservation of\n\n36\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat -Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nHimalayas and will take the following steps:\n\nLaunch \u2018National Mission on Himalayas' as a unique programme of inter-governmental\npartnership, in coordinated policy making and capacity building across states and sectors.\n\nCreate a \u2018Himalayan Sustainability Fund\u2019.\nCreate a Central University dedicated to the Himalayan Technology.\n\nGive due Importance to the programmes devised to arrest the melting of Himalayan glaciers from\nwhich most of the rivers in North India originate.\n\nNatural & National Resources - Use When Required, Protect Where Necessary\n\nIndian belief has been best encapsulated in Gandhiji's words that \"there is enough for everyone's need\n- but not for everyone's greed\". Need is not the issue. Greed is. A country's progress depends upon its\nresources and how they are harnessed and protected. Those in power have to realize they are just\ntrustees of the resources of the nation. The resources are neither meant for them nor for their masters.\nIf we bring this basic shift in thinking of the Government, which Mahatma Gandhi also advocated, all\nproblems will be resolved.\n\nIn recent years, it has been noticed that country's tangible and intangible resources have been looted\nwith impunity. The adverse result is being felt on two sides: Firstly, the proceeds of the resources have\nnot gone to the public exchequer. Secondly, because of this culture of usurping, the same resources\nare not available for public purposes. The management of natural resources is marred with either\nmisappropriation or misallocation. This has to be set right.\n\ne Wewwill set in place national policies on critical natural resources like coal, minerals, spectrum,\netc. - spelling out in black and white how much should be utilized at what time and pace; how this\nshould be strategically phased out to ensure sustainability; who should be allotted what responsibility\nof extraction and at what cost.\n\n \n\nState Governments will be taken into confidence for harnessing of these resources.\n\nWe will implement auction of precious resources through efficient mechanisms including e-\nauction.\n\nResource mapping, exploration and management will be undertaken through the use of technology.\nValue addition will be encouraged in all resources, instead of just marketing.\nSecure Indians - Zero Tolerance on Terrorism, Extremism and Crime\n\nComprehensive national security is not just about borders, but in its broad terms includes military\nsecurity; economic security; cyber security; energy, food and water and health security; and social\ncohesion and harmony. To effectively address the issues of national security, we need to address the\nissues of - human resources, science and technology, system of governance and money.\n\n \n\nNational security cannot be compartmentalized based on one of issues but needs a clear roadmap to\naddress it. Over the past decade, lack of a strong and visionary leadership, coupled with multiple\npower centres, has failed to address the issue of national security, leading to a chaotic situation and\ndenting India's image in the international arena.\n\nIndia has a sensitive neighbourhood and there are internal security issues. There have been intrusions\ninside the LAC (Line of actual control), loss of squadrons of combat aircraft by the air force, witnessing\nof a series of accidents by the Navy, leading to a loss in its combating capability built over many\ndecades, communal riots, Maoist attacks, increase in incidence of Pakistan backed terror groups in\n\n37\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nIndia, illegal immigration across the eastern border, and racists' attacks in the national capital. All\nthese are indications of surrendering of India's interest. This calls for a review and overhauling of the\ncurrent system. With the financial situation worsening, the issue of national security can acquire a\nhorrifying dimension.\n\nBJP recognizes the importance of identifying a clear roadmap to address the issue head-on, with\nradical systemic changes.\n\nInternal Security\n\nBJP will:\n\ne Revive the anti-terror mechanism that has been dismantled by the Congress, strengthen the role\nof NIA and put a system in place for swift and fair trial of terror related cases.\nReform the National Security Council to make it the hub of all sector-related assessments. It will\nbe accountable for real-time intelligence dissemination. Digital and Cyber security will be a thrust\narea.\nInsulate intelligence agencies from political intervention and interference.\nCompletely revamp the intelligence gathering system by modernizing the intelligence department.\n\nProvide the State governments with all assistance to modernize their respective police forces and\nequip them with the latest technology. This will be taken up on a mission mode approach.\n\nStrengthen and expand the Civil Defence and Home Guards mechanism to create a group of\ncitizens for community defence, self-defence and disaster management.\n\nEncourage and strengthen NCC training at the college and University level.\n\nChalk a national plan in consultation and participation of the state Governments, to address the\nchallenges posed by the Maoist's insurgency. Talks with the insurgent groups will be conditional\nand within the framework of the constitution.\n\nTake urgent steps for the safety of the migrant workers and communities from the Northeast and\nother states.\n\nExternal Security - Its Boundary, Beauty and Bounty\n\nBJP will:\n\ne Address the issue of reforms with regards to defence equipment, support services, organizational\nreforms and other related matters.\n\nAddress the increasing shortage of commissioned and non-commissioned staff in the defence\nforces ona priority basis, in a time bound manner.\n\nImplement one rank, one pension.\nBuild a War Memorial to recognize and honour the gallantry of our soldiers.\nTake measures to make Short Service Commission more attractive.\n\nSet up the National Maritime Authority which will be equipped with the best of infrastructure, and\nwill focus on coastal security.\n\nModernize armed forces, and increase the R&D in defence, with a goal of developing indigenous\ndefence technologies and fast tracking of defence purchases.\n\nDeal with cross border terrorism with a firm hand.\nReview and improve the border management.

BJP will strengthen the Defence Research\nand Development Organization (DRDO); encourage private sector participation and investment, including\nFDI in selected defence industries.\n\nTechnology transfer in defence manufacturing will be encouraged to the maximum.\nWe will find solutions to the problems hampering the growth of the defence sector.\n\nWe will encourage domestic industry to have a larger share in design and production of military\nhardware and platforms for both domestic use and exports, in a competitive environment.\n\nIndependent Strategic Nuclear Programme\n\nBJP believes that the strategic gains acquired by India during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime on the\nnuclear programme have been frittered away by the Congress. Our emphasis was, and remains on,\nbeginning of a new thrust on framing policies that would serve India's national interest in the 21st\ncentury. We will follow a two-pronged independent nuclear programme, unencumbered by foreign\npressure and influence, for civilian and military purposes, especially as nuclear power is a major\ncontributor to India's energy sector.\n\nBJP will:\n\ne Study in detail India's nuclear doctrine, and revise and update it, to make it relevant to challenges\nof current times.\n\ne Maintain a credible minimum deterrent that is in tune with changing geostatic realities.\ne Invest in India's indigenous Thorium Technology Programme.\n\nForeign Relations - Nation First, Universal Brotherhood\n\nBJP believes a resurgent India must get its rightful place in the comity of nations and international\ninstitutions. The vision is to fundamentally reboot and reorient the foreign policy goals, content and\nprocess, in a manner that locates India's global strategic engagement in a new paradigm and ona\nwider canvass, that is not just limited to political diplomacy, but also includes our economic, scientific,\ncultural, political and security interests, both regional and global, on the principles of equality and\nmutuality, so that it leads to an economically stronger India, and its voice is heard in the international\nfora.\n\n \n\nBJP believes that political stability, progress and peace in the region are essential for south Asia's\ngrowth and development. The Congress-led UPA has failed to establish enduring friendly and cooperative\n\n39\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nrelations with India's neighbours. India's relations with traditional allies have turned cold. India and its\nneighbours have drifted apart. Instead of clarity, we have seen confusion. The absence of statecraft has\nnever been felt so acutely as today. India is seen to be floundering, whereas it should have been\nengaging with the world with confidence. The collapse of the Indian economy has contributed to the\nsorry state of foreign affairs in no small measure.\n\nWe will build a strong, self-reliant and self-confident India, regaining its rightful place in the comity of\n\nnations. In this, we will be firstly guided by our centuries old tradition of ayaa BSA. At the same\ntime, our foreign policy will be based on best National interests. We will create a web of allies to\nmutually further our interests. We will leverage all our resources and people to play a greater role on\nthe international high table.\n\nIndia has long failed to duly appreciate the full extent and gamut of its soft power potential. There is\na need to integrate our soft power avenues into our external interchange, particularly, harnessing and\nfocusing on the spiritual, cultural and philosophical dimensions of it. India has always played a major\nrole in world affairs, offering a lot to the World. This has been its tradition since time immemorial. The\nmagnetic power of India has always been in its ancient wisdom and heritage, elucidating principles\nlike harmony and equity. This continues to be equally relevant to the world today in today's times of\nSoft power. We will adopt Proactive Diplomacy to spread the same. India was reckoned not only as\nVishwaguru but also a vibrant trading society. Our ancestors used to trade with foreign nations through\nthe routes of sea, centuries ago. This was based on the strength of our business acumen and integrity,\nour products and crafts. The symbols of our ancient civilizations stand as a testimony to our architectural\nand urban planning excellence. We will revive Brand India with the help of our strengths of 5 T's:\nTradition, Talent, Tourism, Trade and Technology.\n\nGuiding Principles of our Foreign Policy will be:\n\nEquations will be mended through pragmatism and a doctrine of mutually beneficial and interlocking\nrelationships, based on enlightened national interest.\n\nWe will champion uniform international opinion on issues like Terrorism and Global Warming.\n\nInstead of being led by big power interests, we will engage proactively on our own with countries in\nthe neighbourhood and beyond.\n\nIn our neighbourhood we will pursue friendly relations. However, where required we will not\nhesitate from taking strong stand and steps.\n\nWe will work towards strengthening Regional forums like SAARC and ASEAN.\n\nWe will continue our dialogue, engagement and cooperation, with global forums like BRICS, G20.\n\nIBSA, SCO and ASEM. States will be encouraged to play a greater role in diplomacy; actively\n\nbuilding relations with foreign countries to harness their mutual cultural and commercial strengths.\nAlso,\n\nWe will expand and empower our pool of diplomats, ensuring our message is taken to the world\nand our great nation represented on the whole in a befitting manner.\n\nThe NRIs, PlOs and professionals settled abroad are a vast reservoir to articulate the national\ninterests and affairs globally. This resource will be harnessed for strengthening Brand India.\nIndia shall remain a natural home for persecuted Hindus and they shall be welcome to seek refuge\nhere.\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat -Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nBJP\n\nCultural Heritage\n\nRam Mandir: BJP reiterates its stand to explore all possibilities within the framework of the constitution\nto facilitate the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.\n\n \n\nRam Setu: Ram Setu is a part of our cultural heritage and also of strategic importance due to its vast\nthorium deposits. These facts will be taken into consideration while taking any decision on 'Sethu-\nSamudram Channel' project.\n\nGanga: River Ganga is a symbol of faith in India, and has a special place in the Indian psyche. It is\nMukti dayini. In addition it is also Jivan dayini for the parts of the country it flows. People and cattle\ndepend on it for agriculture, fodder and drinking water. Pure water of the Ganga are thus essential for\nthe spiritual as well as physical well being of India.\n\nUnfortunately however, even after decades of independence, the Ganga continues to be polluted and is\ndrying. BJP commits to ensure the cleanliness, purity and uninterrupted flow of the Ganga on priority.\nIn addition, a massive 'Clean Rivers Programme' will be launched across the country driven by\npeople's participation.\n\nCow and its Progeny: In view of the contribution of cow and its progeny to agriculture, socio-economic\nand cultural life of our country, the Department of Animal Husbandry will be suitably strengthened and\nempowered for the protection and promotion of cow and its progeny.\n\ne Necessary legal framework will be created to protect and promote cow and its progeny.\n\ne ANational Cattle Development board will be set up to implement a Programme for the improvement\nof indigenous livestock breeds.\n\nHeritage Sites: We will provide appropriate resources for the maintenance and restoration of all\nnational heritage sites, and to prevent their vandalisation in any form. The digitization of archives and\narcheological and museological records would be initiated. A National Mission for beautifying and\nimproving the infrastructure and amenities at pilgrimage centres of all faiths will be launched.\n\nLanguages: Indian Languages are repositories of our rich literature, history, culture, art and scientific\nachievements. Many of our dialects are important source for knowing our heritage. BP would promote\nIndian languages, and put measures for the development of all Indian languages, so that they become\na powerful vehicle for creating a knowledge society.\n\nUniform Civil Code\n\n \n\nArticle 44 of the constitution of India lists Uniform Civil Code as one of the Directive Principles of state\npolicy. BUP believes that there cannot be gender equality till such time India adopts a Uniform Civil\nCode, which protects the rights of all women, and the BJP reiterates its stand to draft a Uniform Civil\nCode, drawing upon the best traditions and harmonizing them with the modern times.\n\nBJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014\nEk Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat\n\n \n\f\nConclusion - Amritmay Bharat\n\nWe aim to build a modern, prosperous and vibrant India - Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, based on our\nethos and values. We have to convert ourselves into a knowledge based society and economy, powered\nby experience, tools of technology and energy of our people. BJP commits itself to this task and\npromises to work relentlessly towards this goal, for which we are seeking sixty months.\n\nIn 2022, we will be celebrating 75 years of India's Independence. In Indian culture, this is celebrated as\nAmrit Mahotsav. For us, every day and every step, every journey and every process will be dedicated\nto make Amritmay Bharat. And all this will be done by all of us, for all of us!\n\nThis is not the time to sit back.

The Bharatiya Janata Party, as the\nleading constituent of the National Democratic Alliance, enters\nthis electoral battle seeking a renewed and bigger mandate for the\nNDA, with a significantly larger representation for itself, in the\nnext Lok Sabha. We do so on the basis of our Performance, Vision\nand Leadership, the proud performance of our Government; our\nclear vision and programme for making India a strong, secure, and\nintegrally Developed Nation by 2020; and the inspiring leadership\nof Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee which is the continuing link between\nour performance so far and our pledge for the future.\n\nIn 1999, the people voted for the National Democratic Alliance.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party was the largest constituent of the NDA\nand the single largest party in the Lok Sabha. Our promise to the\npeople then was encapsulated in the assurance: \u201c Able Leadership,\nStable Government\u201d. On both counts, we have more than fulfilled\nour promise.\n\nThe Vajpayee Government's achievements in strengthening\nnational security, countering cross-border terrorism, fortifying\nnational unity, setting India on the path of high socio-economic\ngrowth, making development the national mantra, and raising\nIndia\u2019s image and standing in the international community have\ncreated a surge of hope and national pride.\n\nThe Pokharan-II blasts in May 1998 triggered a process of\nnational resurgence. India successfully beat back post-Pokharan\nsanctions imposed by big powers. The same countries are now\nkeen on strengthening comprehensive relations with India. There\n\nUntitled-10 8 11/7/2016 11:18:58 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes \u00b0 9\n\nhas been a significant reduction in cross-border terrorism. India\nhas also played a widely acclaimed role in creating international\nawareness and solidarity on the issue of jehadi terrorism.\n\nIndia\u2019s economic fundamentals are robust and its strengths\nenvied. Today ours is one of the fastest growing economies in the\nworld; India\u2019s GDP growth rate is estimated to be over 8 per cent\nthis year. Our Government has heralded a Connectivity Revolution\nin India. Some of the largest and most ambitious projects are now\nunderway for improving India\u2019s infrastructure with highway\nconnectivity, rural roads connectivity, telecom and Internet\nconnectivity, railway connectivity, port and airport connectivity.\nThe past five years have seen the largest ever number of BPL\nfamilies rising above the poverty line over a comparable period\nin independent India\u2019s history.\n\nMajor steps have been taken for addressing the long-neglected\nneeds of agriculture. Agricultural credit has been nearly trebled\nand over 3.5 crore farmers have been given Kisan Credit Cards.\nInterest rates have been significantly lowered. Minimum Support\nPrices for over 25 crops have been raised every year. An innovative\nFarm Income Insurance Scheme has been introduced.\n\nIn a short time, India has emerged as a leading power in\nInformation Technology. Ina short time, our manufacturing sector\nhas restructured itself and become globally competitive. Individual\nIndians have always scripted success stories in India and overseas;\nnow India as a whole is big news. Today, India stands tall in the\ninternational community. Its voice is heard and respected. Our\npeople are finding fresh recognition and new audiences.\n\nThere is a rapidly widening belief, both in our own country\nand all over the world, that India is poised for a great leap forward.\n\nOurs is an ancient nation with a civilisation that is more than\n5,000 years old. We have inherited a glorious cultural heritage,\nwhich the entire world marvels at. India has time and again shown\nunmatched resilience to overcome the vicissitudes of history, to\nemerge resurgent. The time of Indian Renaissance has arrived\nagain. We have set the stage to reclaim our rightful inheritance\nas a Great Power contributing to humanity\u2019s all-round progress.\n\n2.2 The Congress era in Indian politics is over\n\nThe BJP holds the Congress Party, which ruled India for the\nlongest period since Independence, principally guilty for the many\n\nUntitled-10 9 11/7/2016 11:18:58 PM\n\f\n10 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nproblems that our Government inherited. Half a century is not too\nshort a time for a country to be liberated from the curse of poverty\nand backwardness. India did make considerable progress during\nthis period. But this progress fell woefully short of her potential\nas well as her needs.\n\nThis wide gap between promise and performance was the\nresult of the wrong policies of successive Congress governments.\nThey promoted corruption, weakened institutions of the State and\nfailed to mobilise people\u2019s participation in the development process.\nThe Congress Party weakened the bonds of national unity and social\nharmony for partisan gains. Allowing itself to be reduced froma great\nparty of the Freedom Movement to a tool in the hands of a family, it\nsought to reduce the world\u2019s largest democracy to dynastic rule.\n\nThe Congress era in Indian politics is now over. And the BJP\u2019s\nera - the era of nationalist, democratic and development-oriented\npolitics - has begun.\n\nIndia is today a nation once again on the move. We have\nrecovered our bearings. After five decades of wasted opportunities,\nthe Vajpayee Government has infused new life and vigour into the\nsoul of India. From being a nation of unrealised potential, its policies\nand performance have helped unleash India\u2019s positive energies.\n\n2.3 Atalji\u2019s Leadership: A Source of Immense Pride\n\nThe BJP is proud that it has given India and the world a\nleader of the calibre of Shri Vajpayee. As Prime Minister, he has\nharnessed the national energy and transformed the national mood.\nWith his fierce integrity, long tapasya, commitment to the ideals\nof democracy, indomitable patriotism and statesmanship, he has\nshown that he is an embodiment of India\u2019s best political traditions.\n\nShri Vajpayee has demolished the Congress Party\u2019s self-serving\nmyth that it alone, and a member of the Nehru family alone, can rule\nIndia. He has effected a mindset change in the country. In polity, his\nleadership has demonstrated that coalition governance can be stable\nand successful. In society, his personality has promoted the values\nof tolerance, understanding and partnership. In our neighbourhood\nand in the world, his statesmanship has championed the cause of\npeace and dispute resolution through dialogue, while resolutely\nguarding our national interest.\n\nUntitled-10 10 11/7/2016 11:18:58 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 11\n\nUnder Shri Vajpayee\u2019s leadership, an atmosphere of distrust\nand disharmony has been replaced by a spirit of cooperation and\nconsensus. The highhandedness and partisanship that marked\nthe Centre\u2019s relations with the States have given way to a healthy\nUnion. With a good blend of national outlook and legitimate regional\naspirations, the NDA Government has brought the diverse sections\nof our society closer together.\n\nThe Prime Minister has shown unprecedented earnestness\nto resolve outstanding and inherited problems. Thus, Jammu &\nKashmir is returning to peace, normalcy and development after\nwhat seemed to be an unending era of strife, terror and separatist\nactivities fomented from across the border. The fulfilment of his\npromise to hold free and fair elections in the State in 2002 was a\nmajor milestone in this process.\n\nPeace talks in the North-East are also making headway. No\nCentral Government in the past paid as much attention to the\ndevelopmental needs of this important region as the Vajpayee\nGovernment has. For the first time since Independence, a separate\nministry has been established for this purpose.\n\nThe BJP considers the Joint Statement issued during the Prime\nMinister\u2019s January visit to Islamabad a historic foreign policy\nsuccess for India. For the first time, through this joint statement,\nPakistan has committed itself to preventing the use of any part of\nthe territory under its control for terrorist activities aimed against\nIndia.\n\nIf Shri Vajpayee won the hearts of Indians and the admiration\nof the international community with his firm leadership during the\nKargil War, he is repeating the feat now with his earnest pursuit\nof peace-through-dialogue with Pakistan. The whole world today\nrecognizes him as a \u201cMan of Peace\u201d.\n\nShri Vajpayee has boldly demolished the culture of cynicism\nand negativism that impaired the national character. He has\ninspired India to think big, implement big, and believe in itself.\nHe has motivated the youth to nurture big dreams and to work\nhard to realize them. He is indeed \u201cThe Great Unifier\u201d, binding\nIndia\u2019s aspirations, energies and diversities. Oo\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 11 11/7/2016 11:18:58 PM\n\f\nThe Context of Election 2004\n\nFor the people of India the 2004 general election is an opportunity\nto reaffirm faith in the leadership of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee and\nin the policies of the NDA Government. These have yielded initial\nresults and, taken forward, will definitely produce big gains for\nIndia and all Indians.\n\nThe 2004 general election is also an opportunity for all Indians\nto reject the grim, feel-pain record of the Congress Party and endorse\nthe feel-good mood generated by the our Government.\n\nEvery election has a specific context. According to the BJP,\nthe two main issues of Election 2004 are: good governance and\naccelerated, all-round development. There is a new type of hunger\nin India \u2014the tremendous hunger for development. It is especially\nacute in rural areas and among the urban poor. They want to free\nthemselves from poverty, backwardness and underdevelopment.\nThey want to see an end to regional and social imbalances in\ndevelopment. They want the rural-urban divide to be bridged.\nThey want the best opportunities for themselves and their children.\nThey want a standard of living that is fulfilling. They want dignity.\nThey want security and prosperity.\n\nIndia is now impatient to get to the top. India wants to be the\nbest. One billion Indians want to show to themselves, and to the\nworld, what they can do.\n\nIndia has had enough of negativism. The BJP is committed\nto making India a Developed Nation and a Great Power on the\nglobal stage.\n\nWe have the leadership, we have the commitment and we\nhave the vision to make India shine ever brighter.\n\nIn 2004, we seek a decisive mandate for India. Oo\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 12 11/7/2016 11:18:58 PM\n\f\nOur Basic Mission and Commitments\n\n4.1 Politics as a means to serve the Nation:\n\nFrom modest beginnings, the BJP has grown steadily to emerge\nas a stable pole of Indian politics. Our growth is rooted in our\ndistinctive ideology and the tireless dedication of millions of our\nkaryakartas throughout the country. In Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee,\nably assisted by Shri Lal Krishna Advani, we have a leadership that\nhas guided and inspired our Party for decades. For the BJP and\nthe fraternal organisations that constitute our extended Nationalist\nParivar, politics and power have never been ends in themselves, but\na means to serve the people and to contribute to India\u2019s attainment\nof Param Vaibhav (peaks of glory).\n\n4.2 Strengthening India\u2019s Democracy:\n\nThe BJP is deeply committed to strengthening India\u2019s\ndemocracy and to making its institutions more effective in fulfilling\nthe aspirations of our people. We are proud that our Party has\nnurtured the best traditions of internal democracy in India\u2019s\npolitical class. In the years to come, we shall continue to broaden\nthe interaction between the Party organization and the people,\nbetween the people and their elected representatives, and between\nthe Party and the Government to make governance more dynamic,\nmore responsive and more responsible.\n\n4.3 Integral Humanism:\n\nThe BJP is proud of its commitment to the philosophy of\nIntegral Humanism, as enunciated by Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya.\nWe believe that development cannot be measured by economic\nindicators alone. Development must be holistic. It must fulfil the\n\nUntitled-10 13 11/7/2016 11:18:59 PM\n\f\n14 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nmaterial and non-material needs of all individuals and promote a\nsymbiotic relationship between the individual and society, in which\nthe individual works for society, and society, in turn, cares for the\nindividual. Development must also keep in mind environmental\nconcerns, local and community traditions, and the quality of life.\n\nThe BJP believes that economic progress should not be at\nthe cost of family values. The family constitutes the social unit of\nstability, welfare, and continuity of cultural traditions. Its importance\ncan never be undermined. Integral Humanism teaches us that our\nnation too is a family and that India itself is a part of the larger\nhuman family.\n\n4.4 Cultural Nationalism:\n\nThe BJP draws its inspiration from the history and civilisation\nof India. We believe that Indian nationhood stems from a deep\ncultural bonding of the people that overrides differences of caste,\nregion, religion and language. We believe that Cultural Nationalism\nfor which Indianness, Bharatiyata and Hindutva are synonyms - is\nthe basis of our national identity.\n\nContrary to what its detractors say, and as the Supreme Court\nitself has decreed, Hindutva is not a religious or exclusivist concept.\nIt is inclusive, integrative, and abhors any kind of discrimination\nagainst any section of the people of India on the basis of their faith.\nIt rejects the idea of a theocratic or denominational state. It accepts\nthe multi-faith character and other diversities of India, considering\nthem to be a source of strength and not weakness. It firmly upholds\nsecularism, understood as Sarva Pantha Samabhav (treating all\nfaiths with respect).\n\nHowever, the BJP unflinchingly holds that differences in faith\ncannot challenge the idea of India as One Nation or undermine\nour millennia-old identity as One People. This is why, we rejected\nthe two-nation theory on the basis of which our Motherland was\ntragically partitioned in 1947. Thus, Cultural Nationalism is the\nmost potent antidote to communalism, divisiveness, and separatism\nof every kind, and a guarantor of our national unity and national\nintegration.\n\n4.5 Ram Mandir in Ayodhya:\n\nThe BJP reaffirms its commitment to the construction of a\nRam temple in Ayodhya. As Maryada Purushottam, Ram is an\ninspiring cultural symbol of India. His birthplace in Ayodhya is\n\nUntitled-10 14 11/7/2016 11:18:59 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 15\n\nalso associated with the religious sentiments of crores of Hindus.\nThe BJP remains committed to its stand that the judiciary\u2019s verdict\nin this matter should be accepted by all. However, we believe that\ndialogue, and a negotiated settlement in an atmosphere of mutual\ntrust and goodwill, are the best way of achieving this goal. The\nBJP appeals to the religious and social leaders of the Hindu and\nMuslim communities to speed up the process of dialogue and bring\nit to an amicable and early fruition. We hope that these efforts will\nsucceed in heralding a new chapter of amity in Hindu-Muslim\nrelations and fortify national integration.\n\n4.6 Religious Freedom, our Core Value:\n\nContrary to the propaganda of the Congress and our\nother political opponents, Shri Vajpayee\u2019s government has not\ndiscriminated against minorities, nor curtailed their religious\nfreedoms in any manner. In statecraft, we will continue to be wedded\nto our founding ideal of \u201cJustice for All, Appeasement of None\u201d.\nWe envision the day when the distinction between \u201cmajority\u201d and\n\u201cminority\u201d disappears in the political field, even while people\npractise their respective faiths unhindered.\n\nThe BJP gives a three-point assurance to minorities: Education,\nEconomic upliftment, and Empowerment. At the same time, we\nappeal to them to change their old mindset vis-a-vis the BJP and\nstrengthen the hands of Shri Vajpayee in the coming elections.\n\n4.7 Consensus over Uniform Civil Code:\n\nThe BJP believes that all laws, including personal laws, must\nbe in accordance with the guarantees available to all citizens under\nthe Indian Constitution. The Constitution calls for the enactment\nof a Uniform Civil Code. The Supreme Court has reiterated this\nneed. Therefore, this cannot be seen as an issue of any single\npolitical party. The BJP views Uniform Civil Code primarily as an\ninstrument to promote gender justice. We believe that social and\npolitical consensus has to be evolved before its enactment.\n\n4.8 Swadeshi:\n\nThe BJP believes that every civilisation has its own innate\ngenius. We are committed to Swadeshi, the philosophy of India\nFirst, and to the path of self-reliance. Swadeshi means faith in\n\nUntitled-10 15 11/7/2016 11:18:59 PM\n\f\n16 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nindigenous institutions and a strong belief that the future of India\nmust be secured by Indians themselves.\n\nThe BJP believes that India\u2019s goal of achieving a double-digit\nannual GDP growth rate on a sustainable basis can be achieved\nprincipally by mobilizing our own domestic resources. A strong,\nefficient and high-growth Indian economy, in which Indian\nproducts, services and entrepreneurs dominate the domestic and\nglobal markets, is our concept of Swadeshi. This can be achieved\nby making Indian products and services competitive on both cost\nand quality.\n\n4.9 Globalisation:\n\nThe BJP believes that, to reduce the risks and challenges\nof globalisation and to enhance its opportunities and gains, it is\nimperative to bridge the current divide between the developing\nand developed economies. This divide is enabling the developed\nnations to secure unfair advantages for themselves in global trade,\ninvestments, agriculture and services. They give huge trade-\ndistorting agricultural subsidies to their own farmers, but object\nto the legitimate pro-farmer measures by developing countries.\nThe NDA Government has been at the forefront of defending the\ninterests of Indian kisans by bringing about a coalition of developing\ncountries against such unjust practices of developed countries. We\ndid so successfully at the WTO meets in Doha and Cancun. Our\nGovernment has also successfully defended India\u2019s case in other\nmatters such as patents. This approach shall continue.\n\nThe BJP is of the view that a big shift is taking place in the\nglobal economy, and India should be prepared to take advantage of\nit. This shift favours low-cost economies over high-cost economies\nin manufacturing and services, provided the former have sufficient\ncompetitive strengths on the counts of cost, quality and technology.\nThe Indian economy is rapidly acquiring these strengths. The BJP\nis committed to accelerating this process by further reforming\nour economy, modernizing our infrastructure, enriching India\u2019s\nhuman resources, and augmenting our capabilities in science and\ntechnology. This will place our predominantly young population\nin an advantageous position vis-a-vis many advanced nations in\nthe world that are projected to have a demographic disadvantage\n\nUntitled-10 16 11/7/2016 11:18:59 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 17\n\nin the coming decades. This is the Swadeshi approach to turning\nglobalisation into an opportunity for India in the 21st century.\n\n4.10 Underpinnings of Our Economic Vision:\n\nThe BJP believes that India must greatly enhance her economic\nstrength, in order to enhance her national strength and become a\nGreat Power. Towards this strategic goal, the BJP is committed to\nensuring faster economic growth with equity, employment, and\nsocial justice.\n\nThe underpinnings of our economic vision are: steady\nenhancement of the productivity of our human and natural resources\nwith the best use of science, technology, management and HRD\npractices, both modern and traditional; removal of regional and\nsocial imbalances; bridging the urban-rural divide; minimizing\nthe gap between the rich and poor; maximizing developmental\nopportunities for all citizens; and environmental protection.\n\nThe BJP believes that, as India moves from being a developing\ncountry to a developed one, our economic policy has to have a\ntwo-pronged approach: policies to achieve faster economic growth\ncombined with effective welfare measures for the poor. Today the\nforemost national developmental objective is banishment of poverty\nby increasing our national wealth. The surest way to achieve this goal,\nas Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya had emphasized four decades ago,\nis: \u201cWork for Every Hand and Water to Every Land\u201d. Agriculture\ncontinues to be the backbone of India\u2019s rural economy, sustaining\nthe livelihood of a majority of our population. Government policies\nmust, therefore, be geared to encourage domestic savings and\ndirecting them into productive, entrepreneurship-promoting and\nemployment-generating investments, especially in agriculture and\nother areas of the rural economy.\n\nThe BJP believes that wealth creation should be applauded and\nencouraged. However, conspicuous consumption goes against the\ncultural ethos of India. We are not in favour of selfish advancement of\nthe few. Rather, the BJP believes in the multiplication of universally\naccessible entitlements for the majority.\n\nThe BJP is committed to greater consumer choice. We believe\nthat the creation of monopolies, both in the public and private\nsector, are undesirable, except when dictated by national security.\n\nUntitled-10 17 11/7/2016 11:18:59 PM\n\f\n18 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nWe believe in a responsible fiscal regime marked by modest deficits,\nlow inflation and a steadily strengthening rupee.\n\n4.11 India\u2019s Cultural and Spiritual Heritage:\n\nThe BJP considers India\u2019s priceless cultural and spiritual\nheritage to be our intangible national wealth. It has protected our\nfamily system, sustained our national life over the millennia and\ngiven India her unique identity in the world. We are proud that\nall the world\u2019s religions have their footprint in India. We believe\nthat a proper use of our cultural and spiritual resources can greatly\naid India\u2019s developmental endeavours because of their enormous\npower to mobilize people\u2019s energies. This cultural and spiritual\nheritage displays immense diversities, which should be cherished\nand celebrated by all Indians as our common endowment.\n\nWe consider it to be the bounden duty of the Government\nand citizens alike to preserve and further augment this wealth\nof a diverse heritage. In this context, the BJP applauds the NDA\nGovernment\u2019s decision to launch national missions for the\npreservation of manuscripts, monuments, and other facets of our\ncultural, artistic and spiritual heritage. However, a lot more needs\nto be done, considering the neglect of this crucial aspect of nation-\nbuilding in the past.\n\nOo\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 18 11/7/2016 11:18:59 PM\n\f\nOur Priority Agenda for the\nNext Five Years\n\n(The B]P has suggested specific measures under the following areas for\ninclusion in the NDA\u2019s Manifesto for Election 2004.)\n\n5.1 Defence\n\nThe BJP has always attached the highest importance to national\nsecurity. We are proud of the NDA Government's historic initiatives\nto strengthen India\u2019s defence capability and preparedness. We\ncommit ourselves to carrying forward the work done in the past\nfive years. Our priorities will be: speedy implementation of all the\nongoing programmes for modernisation, acquisition and capability\nenhancement; minimizing delays and procedural bottlenecks, which\npush up costs and cause obsolescence; achieving greater efficiency in\ndefence spending; giving a further boost to indigenisation of defence\nproduction and encouragement to private sector participation; and\nmaking defence exports a thrust area.\n\nThe BJP would also work for further augmentation of welfare\nmeasures for ex-servicemen and war widows, creating adequate\nopportunities for retired officers to contribute to development\nactivities where they can put their skills and training to productive\nuse; and making service in the Armed Forces an attractive career\noption for the educated Indian youth.\n\n5.2 Internal Security\n\nThe BJP believes that creating a society free of fear, and\nensuring safety and security to all citizens form the cornerstone\nof good governance. Our war on terrorism, which has shown\n\nUntitled-10 19 11/7/2016 11:19:00 PM\n\f\n20 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nencouraging results in the past five years, will continue with\nunflagging determination. Building on the significant reduction\nof communal and caste violence in the past five years, we shall\nwork with redoubled zeal to realise our vision of a riot-free India.\n\nThe long misrule of the Congress Party weakened India\u2019s\ninternal security apparatus and reduced its capacity to counter\njehadi terrorism, left-wing extremism, organised crime, and,\nin some States, even to maintain law and order. For the first\ntime since Independence, the NDA Government conducted a\ncomprehensive review of the internal security scenario, started to\nact on its recommendations and launched a massive programme to\nmodernise our police and paramilitary forces. The BJP is concerned\nat the inadequate utilization of the police modernization fund in\nseveral States, even though the need for it is glaring. We will work\nwith State Governments for time-bound implementation of this\nprogramme with utmost urgency.\n\nWe will continue our efforts to build political consensus to\nenact a Central law, and constitute a federal agency to deal with\nfederal crimes like the Telgi scam, which encompass several States.\nWe will also work with the States to urgently implement police\nreforms that would make the police and security forces more\npeople-friendly, more sensitive towards the grievances of the poor,\nweaker sections of society, and women.\n\nThe BJP recognises the growing menace of left-wing extremism,\nwhich extends from the Nepal border to Andhra Pradesh, as one of\nthe most serious challenges to India\u2019s internal security. Overcoming\nthis menace, with the closest possible cooperation among the\naffected States and the Centre, will be our priority. Since the fight\nagainst Naxalite outfits can be successfully waged primarily by\nisolating them from local populations, our Government will take\nfurther steps to speed up development activities, encourage people\u2019s\nparticipation in them, and ensure that their benefits actually reach\nthe poor.\n\n5.3 Jammu & Kashmir\n\nThe unity of India is not only sacred to the BJP, but also a\nparamount commitment. We have always believed that Jammu\n& Kashmir, including the PoK, is an integral part of India. We\n\nUntitled-10 20 11/7/2016 11:19:00 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 21\n\nhold that the age of redrawing national boundaries is over. While\nrecognizing that the Constitution provides for certain transient and\ntemporary provisions for Jammu & Kashmir, we believe that the\nimmediate challenge before the Centre and the State is to involve all\nsections of society in eliminating terrorism, accelerating economic\ndevelopment and strengthening popular governance that can\nprovide people-friendly administration. The imperative for security\noperations has to be balanced with respect for human rights. We\nare committed to ensuring early return of Kashmiri Pandits and\nother displaced people to their native places.\n\nWe believe in balanced development of all the three regions\nof the State\u2014Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh\u2014without any\ndiscrimination against any section of the State\u2019s population. To\nensure this, the BJP is committed to a three-point programme:\n\n(a) Autonomous Regional Councils for Jammu and Ladakh\n\nwith adequate financial and administrative powers;\n\n(b) Protection of the original demographic identity of the\n\nthree regions.\n\n(c) Equitable distribution of funds from the Centre.\n\nThe BJP strongly condemns the recent move by the Government\nof J&K to introduce a law that discriminates against women\nmarrying outside the State in matters of inheritance rights. We will\ndo everything democratically possible to stop such anti-women\nmoves.\n\n5.4 North-East\n\nThe NDA Government has given unprecedented attention to\nthe development of the North-Eastern States. Consolidating the\ngains already made, we are committed to achieving:\n\n(a) Restoration of peace and normalcy in all the disturbed\nregions by dialogue with all groups who are willing to\ngive up the path of violence, and by firmly dealing with\nthose who continue on this path.\n\n(b) Ensuring that the ethnic identities of all the people in the\nNorth-East are protected.\n\n(c) Putting an end to infiltration from Bangladesh and\nvigorously pursuing the 3-D formula \u2014 Detect, Delete, and\nDeport.\n\nUntitled-10 21 11/7/2016 11:19:00 PM\n\f\n22 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n(d) Accelerating economic development that provides growth\nopportunities to all.\n(e) Development of the communication infrastructure to\novercome the constraints of physical distance.\n(f) Making all Indians more aware of the rich history and\ncultural heritage of our North-Eastern States, including\nSikkim.\n(g) Expanding regional economic cooperation with countries\nin our eastern neighbourhood and in South East Asia.\nThe BJP is also committed to imparting further momentum\nto the activities of the Island Development Authority to attend to\nthe needs of the people of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshdweep\nIslands.\n\n5.5 Poverty Alleviation\n\nThe BJP stands committed to tackling dire poverty on a war\nfooting. The persistence of abject poverty after more than 50 years\nof Independence is a result of both misrule and the faulty policies\nfollowed by the Congress. In the past six years, the number of\nIndians living below the poverty line has diminished significantly.\nHowever, an unacceptably large number of our citizens are so\nsteeped in poverty that they are unable to reap the full benefits of\nIndia\u2019s march forward, or to contribute their fullest to it.\n\nWe shall wipe out the problems of poverty and backwardness\nby mounting a five-pronged attack:\n\n5.5.1 By policies aimed at fully harnessing India\u2019s productive\npotential and creating national wealth;\n\n5.5.2 By policies that ensure distributive justice by expanding\nthe basket of opportunities for all;\n\n5.5.3 By policies that direct greater governmental investment\nand incentivise more private investment in backward and\nrural areas;\n\n5.5.4 By policies and programmes that bring vibrancy to the\nrural economy, expand and deepen rural markets, and\nthus create large-scale employment and self-employment\nopportunities locally.\n\n5.5.5 By continuing and further strengthening Antyodaya\nschemes targeted at BPL families and social security\nschemes aimed at the unorganized sector.\n\nUntitled-10 22 11/7/2016 11:19:00 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 23\n\n5.5.6 By effecting time-bound distribution of surplus land and\nmaking the rural poor partners in the development of\nwasteland;\n\n5.5.7 By giving inalienable ownership rights to tribals who have\nbeen traditionally living on forest lands.\n\n5.6 Second Green Revolution\n\nThe route to agricultural prosperity and rural regeneration\nlies in scientific management of water, land and bio resources,\nand better linkages with both domestic and export markets. Our\nvision has three objectives: (a) Indian agriculture should meet the\ngrowing domestic demand; (b) it should emerge as an important\nglobal player; and (c) agriculture should become remunerative\neven to small farmers with shrinking landholdings.\n\nThe first Green Revolution enabled India to achieve self-\nsufficiency in food. However, it did not address many critical\nproblems in agriculture and food economy. The BJP believes\nthat a Second Green Revolution is needed to increase farm\nproductivity, achieve crop diversification, reduce waste and\nadd value at every stage in the food chain linking the kisan\nto the consumer. Towards this end, we will continue to give a\nboost to dairy, poultry and other food-processing industries.\nWe will promote horticulture, floriculture, sericulture, and\ncultivation of bio-fuels, medicinal plants and bamboo in a big\nway. We will take up crop insurance scheme and the newly\nlaunched farm income insurance scheme for effective and large-\nscale implementation. Comprehensive reform of agricultural\nmarkets; free movement of agricultural goods throughout the\ncountry; setting up of cold storages, godowns and grain banks;\nintensification of technology transfer and agricultural extension\nservices; and support to organic farming will be given priority in\nthe Second Green Revolution.\n\nAgricultural workers, many of whom are marginal farmers\nthemselves, form a large section of the rural poor. The BJP is\ncommitted to lifting them above BPL levels, ensuring sustainable\nyear-long employment with minimum wages, enhancing their\nlabour productivity, expanding the social security net for them,\nand improving their overall quality of life.\n\nUntitled-10 23 11/7/2016 11:19:00 PM\n\f\n24 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nThe BJP is fully committed to preserving India\u2019s animal\nwealth especially, to protection of Gau Mata (Cow) and her\nprogeny. We shall evolve a consensus to bring a Central\nlegislation in this regard.\n\n5.7 Support to Cottage Industries\n\nRevitalization of India\u2019s cottage industries, arts and handicrafts\nforms the pivot of the BJP\u2019s vision of faster economic growth\nwith equity and employment. Towards this end, we will intensify\nour efforts to ensure that the banking sector and government\ndepartments are receptive to their special needs. We will improve\nlinkages with domestic and export markets for their products.\nActivities of the Khadi & Village Industries Commission (KVIC)\nand its affiliate bodies, which have done remarkable work in the\npast five years, will be given greater support.\n\n5.8 Making India a Global Manufacturing Hub\n\nThe BJP believes that India can become the manufacturing\nhub for the world. India\u2019s capability to achieve this goal is evident\nfrom the highly encouraging initial successes in pharmaceuticals,\nautomobiles, auto-components, engineering goods and some\nother products. We aim to provide the conditions for a broad\nmanufacturing base that can export its products all over the\nworld, and can compete not only on cost but also on quality and\ntechnology. In the process, we aim to actively facilitate the creation\nof global Indian brands and Indian MNCs. Our small and medium\nenterprises (SMEs), the KVIC sector, and traditional industries such\nas textiles, gems and jewellery and leather, have a huge potential\nto contribute to this endeavour. This potential will be unleashed\nthrough suitable policy and institutional measures. We will take\nnecessary steps to realize similar growth potential in our food-\nprocessing, telecom and IT hardware, and other industries.\n\nA competitive manufacturing sector requires the simultaneous\nfulfillment of various conditions. They include a network of good\nroads and railways, efficient ports and airports, low-cost and\nreliable power, cutting-edge communication and IT infrastructure,\nstrengthening of India\u2019s core sector oil and natural gas, steel, coal,\nminerals, metals \u2014, quality educational institutions that provide a\n\nUntitled-10 24 11/7/2016 11:19:01 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 25\n\nskilled workforce, a sophisticated financial sector which can meet\nlow-cost capital needs of businesses, modern trading environment,\nand, above all, maximum government facilitation with minimum\ngovernment interference. Specifically, firm and quick steps will\nbe taken to put an end to the tyranny of the Red Tape and the\nInspector Raj, which breeds corruption, drains the growth potential\nand demotivates Indian entrepreneurs.\n\nWe are proud that India has successfully embarked on this\ngrowth-oriented path. Unlike during the Congress years, the \u201cMade\nin India\u201d brand is making waves in global markets. We envision\na future when it will dominate world markets in a wide range of\nproducts, creating large-scale prosperity and employment at home.\nThe BJP will actively work for the realization of this vision.\n\n5.9 Putting India at the Centre of the Knowledge Economy\n\nThe BJP is proud of the spectacular achievements of India\u2019s\nsoftware professionals and entrepreneurs both at home and abroad.\nThey have not only given India a new stream of wealth-creation and\nemployment generation, but also brightened our country\u2019s image\nglobally. The BJP believes that this is just the beginning, and the\nbest of India in the emerging Knowledge Economy is yet to come.\n\nTo achieve this, we have to consolidate India\u2019s leadership in\nsoftware exports and strengthen our IT hardware industry. We\nalso have to expand our share in employment-intensive IT-enabled\nservices across the value spectrum through enterprises like call\ncenters and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) centres. The BJP\nsees India emerging as a preferred service provider to the world in an\never-widening range of services, including high-paying professional\nservices of teachers, doctors, lawyers, managers, accountants, and\nscientists. We will fully support our bio-technology sector, which\nis making rapid strides. India has acquired impressive self-reliant\nstrengths in space research, peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and\ncivilian applications of defence research. These strengths will be\nfurther augmented and commercialised appropriately. We will\nalso strive to develop Indian businesses in other frontier areas\nof technology, such as micro-electronics, nano-technology, new\nmaterials, etc.\n\nTo achieve these ends, we have to make India a front-ranking\n\nUntitled-10 25 11/7/2016 11:19:01 PM\n\f\n26 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nnation in scientific and technological R&D. Partnership between\nIndian businesses and CSIR, DRDO, ICAR, ICMR, ISRO, BARC,\nIITs, universities and other government-supported research\ninstitutions will be vastly expanded. We will actively encourage\nmore foreign companies to set up their R&D centers in India or\nstart joint R&D activities with Indian entities. Our NRI and PIO\nprofessionals and entrepreneurs would be encouraged to participate\nin this partnership.\n\n5.10 Our Vision for an Ideal Indian Village\n\nMajority of India\u2019s population continues to live in villages.\nHowever, the neglect of the development needs of villages is one of\nthe particularly damning parts of the legacy left behind by the long\nCongress misrule. This is clear from two stark facts: even after five\ndecades of Independence, as many as 1.86 lakh villages one-third\nof all villages in the country were deprived of good roads; and as\nmany as 60% of our rural households have no toilets.\n\nIn line with what Mahatma Gandhi had said, the BJP believes\nthat India cannot rise to her full potential without the revitalization\nof rural India. Our vision of an ideal Indian village is one that\nhas the following attributes: (a) self-reliant society and dynamic\neconomy that makes best use of local human and natural resources\nand has linkages to the national and global economy; (b) modern\ninfrastructure and basic amenities \u2014 bijlee, sadak, paani, education,\nquality healthcare at the nearest place, and sanitation\u2014that are\nneeded to ensure a high quality of life for all inhabitants; (c) full\nemployment to all able-bodied persons; (d) free of social and\neconomic exploitation; (e) a harmonious, cooperative and caring\nenvironment; (f) Antyodaya or concern for the development of\nthe last man; (g) effective functioning of Panchayat bodies with\npeople\u2019s participation and involvement of voluntary organisations;\nand (h) a vibrant cultural life that displays both modernity and\npride in Indian traditions.\n\nThe BJP is committed to taking all our villages towards this\nideal. We have taken several important steps in this direction,\nthe most notable among them being the blueprint of a new\ncomprehensive rural development initiative called PURA (Provision\nof Urban Amenities in Rural Areas). PURA aims at providing\n\nUntitled-10 26 11/7/2016 11:19:01 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 27\n\nfour types of connectivity to every Indian village: Physical\nConnectivity, Digital Connectivity, Knowledge Connectivity, and\nMarket Connectivity to every rural cluster in the country. Speedy\nimplementation of this programme will be our priority.\n\n5.11 Our Vision for an Ideal Indian City\n\nIndia is rapidly urbanizing. At the same time, Indian cities and\ntowns are groaning under unplanned and unaesthetic growth, made\nevident by their overstretched infrastructure, severe shortage of\nbasic amenities, proliferation of slums, and unhygienic environment.\nThis has affected the quality of life of all sections of the urban\npopulation most of all the urban poor. The continuance of this reality\nis incompatible with our vision of India as a Developed Nation.\n\nNo previous government paid as much attention to urban\nrenewal as the Vajpayee Government has done since its inception.\nHUDCO\u2019s loans for urban infrastructure rose by 550% during the\npast six years, compared to the previous 28 years.\n\nOur vision of an ideal Indian city is one in which our cities\n(a) provide a high quality of material and cultural life to all their\ninhabitants, with strong human bonds that is the hallmark of Indian\nsociety; (b) have good infrastructure, civic amenities, and pollution-\nfree environment; (c) are free of slums and illegal encroachments, and\ndisplay aesthetic city planning; (d) preserve their unique tangible\nand intangible heritage; (e) are engaged in promotion knowledge\nand diverse creative pursuits; (f) Have good municipal governance\nwith strong community participation and, above all, (g) serve as\nengines of India\u2019s rapid economic growth, providing adequate\nemployment opportunities and ideal conditions for entrepreneurs\nand professionals to flourish in the era of globalisation.\n\nThe BJP is committed to working towards this ideal by\nintroducing major urban governance reforms and massively\nexpanding the programme for urban renewal in the coming years.\n\n5.12 Dealing with the Challenge of Water\n\nThe BJP recognises that scarcity of water in both rural and urban\nareas has assumed serious proportions in many parts of the country.\nThere is an urgent need for a people\u2019s movement, supplementing\ngovernment efforts, for conservation, management and rational\n\nUntitled-10 27 11/7/2016 11:19:01 PM\n\f\n28 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nuse of this scarce resource for drinking, agriculture, industry and\ndomestic purposes. The problem needs a multi-pronged strategy\nthat combines both mega and micro initiatives. We remain fully\ncommitted to starting work on the interlinking of rivers, with due\nconsideration for environmental protection and rehabilitation of\ndisplaced people.\n\nHowever, we attach greater importance to millions of local\ninitiatives for desilting of tanks, lakes and reservoirs, restoration\nof wells, recharging of natural aquifers, building check dams,\npromotion of drip irrigation, desalination of sea water, rainwater\nharvesting, recycling of water, and other means of water conservation\nand efficient water management. Cleaning of all polluted rivers and\ntraditional water bodies, with people\u2019s participation of the kind that\nwas evident in olden times, should be taken up in a mission mode.\n\n5.13 Dealing with the Challenge of Employment\n\nThe BJP recognizes that unemployment is a major problem\nfaced by a significant section of the Indian youth. At the same time,\nwe confidently state that no other government in the past paid\nas much attention to dealing with this problem, and achieved so\nmuch success, as did the NDA Government. It is our Government,\nwhich, for the first time, promised to facilitate creation of one crore\nadditional employment and self-employment opportunities each\nyear. We have substantially succeeded in fulfilling this promise.\nBetween 1999-2002, for which official figures are available, 84 lakh\nemployment and self-employment opportunities were created on\naverage, per year.\n\nThe nature of employment generation has altered with the\nchanging nature of the economy. Government jobs and jobs in the\norganized industry are shrinking not only in India and this is true\nof Congress and Communist-ruled States too but all over the world.\nAt the same time, large-scale employment and self-employment\nopportunities have come up in services and the unorganized sector\n(whose preponderance in the Indian economy has been steadily\ngrowing), housing and road construction, telecom and IT, tourism,\netc.\n\nIn the coming years, our strategy to deal with the challenge\nof employment will be four-pronged:\n\nUntitled-10 28 11/7/2016 11:19:01 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 29\n\n5.13.1 Sustaining a high rate of annual GDP growth 8% going up to\ndouble digits and broadbasing the growth in employment-\ngenerating sectors of the economy.\n\n5.13.2 Higher allocation to, and better implementation of,\nthe Government\u2019s employment and self-employment\ngeneration schemes such as the Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar\nYojana, which is the biggest food-for-work programme\nsince Independence launched by our Government, self-\nhelp groups, etc.\n\n5.13.3 Evaluating every development policy and programme\nfrom the point of view of its potential to create\nemployment and self-employment opportunities.\nPolicies and programmes that promise to deliver this\ngoal will be given special thrust. Thus, agri-processing,\nsupport services for agriculture, textiles, handicrafts,\nwasteland development, social forestry, housing and\nconstruction activities, renewal of urban infrastructure\nand amenities, retail trade, tourism, transportation,\netc. will be given priority in terms of investment and\nfacilitation.\n\n5.13.4 Providing special thrust to vocational education and training\nto match the needs of the economy. In rural areas our focus\nwill be mainly on skill upgradation of people engaged in\ntraditional occupations. In urban areas our focus will be\nmainly on enhancing the employability of students and\nyouth, and create an aptitude for self-employment and\nentrepreneurship.\n\n5.14 Developing a Democracy of Stakeholders\n\nThe BJP is committed to continuing reforms in the financial\nsector that have contributed to better performance of the corporate\nsector and the evolution of well regulated stock markets. We believe\nthat the gains of this process must be shared more equitably. Today,\nless than 2 per cent of Indians are retail investors. We believe that\nthe base of investment in equities must be broadened. The BJP\nbelieves that the advantages of low interest credit must be shared\nby all productive forces in society, including small businesses, the\nself-employed and farmers.\n\nUntitled-10 29 11/7/2016 11:19:02 PM\n\f\n30 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nThe BJP is proud that the vigilance and intervention of the\nUnion Government have helped revive institutions like the UTI.\nWe believe that public financial institutions and corporate houses\nmust conduct themselves with exemplary responsibility.\n\n5.15 Widening the Social Security Net\n\nThe BJP is proud of the NDA Government's initiative to launch\na social security scheme for 37 crore people in the unorganized\nsector. Expanding its coverage and its effective implementation will\nbe our commitment. The BJP believes that all Indians must have\naccess to competitive and well regulated pension and insurance\nschemes tailored to every income level. The needs of senior citizens,\nwidows, disabled persons, etc. will continue to receive our special\nconsideration. We shall ensure that money invested will be both\nsecure and will fetch good returns.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 30 11/7/2016 11:19:02 PM\n\f\nFocus on Social Development\n\nThe BJP believes that faster economic growth cannot be an end\nin itself; rather, it is a means to ensure a high quality of life to all\ncitizens by fulfilling their material needs and satisfy their social,\neducational and cultural aspirations.\n\n6.1 Education for All\n\nWe believe that both society and the Government at all levels\nmust give top priority to meeting the goal of \u201cQuality Education\nfor All\u201d since education aids both economic growth and social\ndevelopment. Its importance in the emerging Knowledge Economy\nhas increased manifold. Enriched human resources of our one billion\npopulation can propel India into a higher orbit of development\nwith limitless possibilities in the new century.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s ideal of good education is one expressed in Swami\nVivekananda\u2019s profound words: \u201cEducation for Man-Making and\nNation-Building\u201d. India needs a system of education that opens\nthe doors of knowledge to all citizens, develops their talents and\nskills, anchors them strongly in human values and Indian culture,\nreinforces their patriotism, and equips them to explore opportunities\nboth in India and abroad.\n\nBecause of inadequate and unbalanced attention by successive\ngovernments in the past, India continues to face major challenges\nin education. Our strategy for overcoming these challenges and\nunleashing the potential of India\u2019s enviable human resources has\nthe following underpinnings:\n\n6.1.1 Steadily raising the total spending on education to 6% of\nthe GDP by 2010, with enlarged public-private partnership.\n6.1.2 Achieving complete eradication of illiteracy within a\n\nUntitled-10 31 11/7/2016 11:19:02 PM\n\f\n32 * Party Document Vol-1\n\ndecade. For this, we will ensure that every child goes to\nschool, every school is made accountable to the community,\nevery State is made accountable for its quality education\nstatus, and appropriate resources both from Government\nand non-government sources are mobilized to match our\nambitious goals.\n\n6.1.3 Further intensification of measures aimed at education of\nthe girl child, and spread of education among SCs, STs,\nOBCs and minorities.\n\n6.1.4 Improving the standards of education at all levels of the\nEducational Pyramid from primary to university.\n\n6.1.5 Making quality education affordable to a common Indian\nfamily. No student should be deprived of access to higher\neducation for lack of resources. Hence, scholarships and\nsoft loans should be made widely available.\n\n6.1.6 While encouraging private investment, necessary steps will\nhave to be taken to check commercialization of education.\n\n6.1.7 Rectifying the biases in history education, increasing the\nmoral and cultural content in syllabi, and restoring the\nneglected focus on character-building.\n\n6.1.8 De-bureacratising the administration of our educational\ninstitutions; autonomy to centers of excellence; empowering\nteachers; and maximizing community participation.\n\n6.1.9 Enlarging the partnership between Government and the\nprivate sector, and between industry and universities, to\npromote world-class R&D.\n\n6.1.10 Making India a preferred higher education destination\nfor students from all over the world. This would not only\nreduce huge spending abroad by rich Indians, but also\nenable India to earn significantly from higher education.\n\n6.2 Healthcare for All\n\nThe BJP believes that healthcare is a basic need and rightful\nentitlement of every citizen. Hence, its provision should be made\nimmune to the citizen\u2019s economic status. Wrong policies, inadequate\nresource allocation, and neglect of our country\u2019s traditional wisdom\nby the Congress governments have created daunting problems in\nthis field. The BJP\u2019s strategy to overcome them, and to enable India\n\nUntitled-10 32 11/7/2016 11:19:02 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 33\n\nto move quickly towards the goal of \u201cHealth For All\u201d, is guided\nby the following principles:\n\n6.2.1 The Centre and State Governments should together facilitate\nmanifold increase in spending on healthcare, with enlarged\npublic-private partnership.\n\n6.2.2 The priority of public spending should be on primary\nhealthcare, with a focus on preventive rather than curative\nmeasures.\n\n6.2.3 Increasing people\u2019s awareness about health issues and\nmaking them take good care of themselves by cultivating\nhealthy habits and lifestyles; towards this end, building a\nstrong physical and sports culture among all age-groups.\n\n6.2.4 Healthcare should be made affordable to the poor and\nmiddle classes.\n\n6.2.5 The NDA Government's good work in promoting yoga,\nayurveda, naturopathy and other systems of indigenous\nmedicine should be vastly intensified.\n\n6.2.6 Private and foreign investment in tertiary and super-\nspecialty healthcare should be encouraged. However, all\nprivate healthcare establishments should have enhanced\nobligation for treating poor patients.\n\n6.2.7 Public-private partnerships should be institutionalized\non the widest possible scale.\n\n6.2.8 Concerted efforts should be made for India\u2019s emergence\nas a centre of health tourism.\n\n6.3 Social and Economic Justice\n\nThe BJP has always been a strong votary of social justice for\nSCs, STs, OBCs and other disadvantaged social groups. Going\nbeyond the traditional advocacy of this important cause, we\nhave also been consistently emphasising two related imperatives\n(a) social justice is incomplete without economic justice and political\nempowerment; and (b) The means to secure social justice (samajik\nnyay) have to also promote social harmony (samajik samarasata).\n\nTo advance these ideals, the BJP commits itself to:\n6.3.1 Strict implementation of provisions of the policy on\nreservations. A major drive has to be launched for filling\nup all backlogs in jobs and promotions for SCs, STs and\n\nUntitled-10 33 11/7/2016 11:19:02 PM\n\f\n34 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nOBCs.\n\n6.3.2 Private sector enterprises will be incentivised for\ncreating more educational, training, employment and\nentrepreneurship opportunities for SCs and STs.\n\n6.3.3 Strict enforcement of laws to check atrocities against SCs,\nSTs and other weaker sections.\n\n6.3.4 Provision of greater financial resources and better\nmanagerial resources for the delivery of education,\nhealthcare, and other social security services to the poor\nand weaker sections of society.\n\n6.3.5 Improvement in the functioning of various Commissions\nand Finance Corporations for the development of SCs and\nSTs.\n\n6.3.6 Operationalisation of the newly announced Commission\nfor Nomadic and Denotified Tribes and development\ncorporation for the shepherd community.\n\n6.3.7 Safeguarding and promoting the economic wellbeing of\nfishermen and others engaged in traditional occupations.\n\n6.3.8 Serious consideration to the recommendations of the newly\nestablished Commission for examining reservations for\nthe poor among \u201cForward Classes\u201d.\n\n6.4 Welfare of Tribals\n\nOf all the deprived and neglected sections of society, tribal\nIndians suffered the most during the long Congress rule. Their\nability to benefit from the policy of reservations in education and\njobs has remained far less than that of the Scheduled Castes and\nOBCs. Many of them have been uprooted from their habitations and\nlivelihoods in forests. Frequently they are victims of exploitation\nby powerful local interests and harassment by the police and\ngovernment officials. They rank the lowest in literacy, longevity,\nhealth status and other indicators of human development.\n\nThe BJP is committed to ending the plight of India\u2019s tribals.\nOurs was the first government, since Independence, to set up a\nseparate ministry for tribal welfare and also a separate commission\nand a separate finance and development corporation for tribals.\nWe shall take necessary steps for regularization of land rights of\ntribals living on forest lands and for promoting their economic\n\nUntitled-10 34 11/7/2016 11:19:02 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 35\n\nactivities based on forest produce. These measures, in addition to\nproviding them livelihood security, will also help in preservation\nof our forests. The BJP believes that, as the original inhabitants\nof forests with a deep attachment to their natural endowments,\ntribals are the best protectors of our depleting forest and wildlife\nresources. We will also take steps to preserve tribal art and culture,\nhonour tribal heroes, and frustrate efforts to create a wedge between\ntribals and non-tribals.\n\n6.5 Women\u2019s Empowerment\n\nThe BJP is committed to gender equality and justice. We\nconsider educational, social, economic and political empowerment of\nwomen to be one of the preconditions for making India a Developed\nNation. Our Party is committed to providing women an enabling\nenvironment free from injustice and violence in the public as well\nas the private sphere, which would pave the way for women to\ncontribute to every walk of life. We would develop strategies to\nenable women in balancing work and family by introducing a\nnational childcare plan, decent wages, workplace flexibility, and\ngreater career opportunities.\n\nThe BJP believes that every able-bodied woman should have\nat least some source of livelihood, so that she can enjoy economic\nindependence within the framework of a harmonious family.\nEducation not only equips her to raise her economic and social\nstatus, but also helps our country realize many of its developmental\ngoals. Accordingly, the BJP commits itself to eliminating gender\ndisparities in both education and property rights. In official records of\nschemes such as giving land or a house, woman will be made a joint\nbeneficiary having precedence over man. Opportunities for women\nin training, employment, self-employment and entrepreneurship\nwill be expanded. Simultaneously, we will intensify governmental\nand societal efforts to ensure safety for women, and clamp down on\nfemale foeticide, dowry, trafficking and rape.\n\nIndia has a very rich tradition of the social reforms movement\nwhere men championed the cause of women. In the 21st century,\nit is once again necessary for men to play a constructive role in\nestablishing gender equality. They can play an especially crucial\nrole in ensuring dignity of women and eliminating violence against\n\nUntitled-10 35 11/7/2016 11:19:03 PM\n\f\n36 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nthem.\n\nOurs was the first party to raise the demand for 33% reservation\nfor women in Parliament and State legislatures. We remain\ncommitted to this goal. It is well known that the NDA Government\ndid its best to enact the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill. However, the\nCongress and some other parties sabotaged it. The BJP is prepared\nto support any alternative proposal for women\u2019s reservation, on\nwhich broad consensus can be forged. We believe that the nation\u2019s\ncommitment to take this revolutionary step forward can no longer\nbe kept in abeyance.\n\n6.6 Population Control\n\nThe BJP is convinced that neglect of the imperative of\npopulation control is one of the main causes for the shortcomings\nin India\u2019s all-round development. The Vajpayee Government has\ntaken steps to overcome this neglect. We believe that the goals and\ntargets set in the National Population Policy can be realized only\nby making it a people\u2019s movement. State Governments \u2014 especially\nin those States that are lagging behind\u2014and communities have\nto be energized. The BJP also believes that the time has come to\nintroduce a set of incentives and non-coercive disincentives for the\nsuccess of this campaign. We are in favour of providing incentives\nfor the girl child within a two-child norm. Our Party shall build\nconsensus over ways that would ensure success of this mission.\n\n6.7 Securing a Bright Future for India\u2019s Children\n\nIndia is home to the largest child population in the world.\nEvery fifth child in the world is an Indian. Hence, what happens\nto India\u2019s children will determine not only India\u2019s future, but also\nthe future of the world. For the BJP, securing a bright future for\nIndia\u2019s children is both a moral obligation and a matter of political\nurgency. We are proud of the Vajpayee Government's initiatives in\nthis regard for example, making free and compulsory elementary\neducation a fundamental right through a Constitutional amendment;\nlaunching \u2018Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan\u2019, the biggest ever educational\nprogramme since Independence; and vastly enlarging the scope of\nthe Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) to cover nearly\nall the blocks in the country.\n\nUntitled-10 36 11/7/2016 11:19:03 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 37\n\nWe are committed to further intensifying our efforts to put\nthe needs, aspirations and rights of children at the heart of our\ndevelopment agenda. Drastic reduction in infant and maternal\nmortality, special focus on the education of the girl child, ending\nmalnutrition among children from poor families, elimination of\nchild labour, and the care of orphans will be our priority.\n\n6.8 Unleashing India\u2019s \u2018Yuva Shakti\u2019\n\nDemographically India is a Young Nation. Nearly 65 per cent\nof our population is below the age of 35. This \u2018yuva shakti\u2019 (youth\npower) is a source of immense strength and hope for the India\nof our dreams in the 21st century. Our first priority is to ensure\nthat every young Indian is gainfully employed or self-employed,\nsecuring not only their own livelihood but also contributing to\ntheir family\u2019s well-being and to the country\u2019s progress. By their\nvery nature, young people are an overflowing reservoir of energy,\nenthusiasm, creativity, idealism and patriotism. It is the duty of\nthe government and society to create opportunities for the full\nflowering of these attributes. Care should be taken to see that\ntheir grievances and resentment over any issue are not exploited\nby parochial and anti-social elements.\n\nThe spirit of adventure among the youth and their natural\ninclination for voluntary service need to be promoted. Infrastructure\nfor sports, arts, cultural activities and social service, and support\nfor youth organizations engaged in these activities, need to be\nstepped up at all levels from the national to the local. In particular,\nIndian sports, which have suffered marginalisation, deserve special\nencouragement. We are proud that the Vajpayee Government not\nonly created a separate Ministry for Sports and Youth Affairs for\nthe first time since Independence, but also effected a five-fold\nincrease in the allocation for sports in the Tenth Plan. The BJP\u2019s\nvision is to see that India emerges as a major Sports Power in the\nworld over the next ten years. We will work for the realization 0\nthis vision. Oo\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 37 11/7/2016 11:19:03 PM\n\f\nGood Governance Issues\n\n7.1 Governance Reforms\n\nThe principal aspect of the Congress misrule was its failure to\ntransform India\u2019s hard-won Swaraj (self-governance) into Su-raj\n(good governance). It caused the government to enter every sphere\nof our national life, excessively enlarging the ordinary citizen\u2019s\ninterface with the public authority. The overload of the government\nhas led to inefficiency, harassment and corruption. Rather than being\nat the service of the people, the state machinery has reduced them\nto being supplicants. Its lack of transparency and accountability\nhas alienated the people. Its highly bureaucratic working has\nundermined their entrepreneurial energies and discouraged citizens\u2019\ninitiatives. In the absence of people\u2019s active participation, policies\nand programmes frequently fail to deliver desired results.\n\nPunitive levels of taxation created a national culture of\ndishonesty. The licence-permit-quota raj produced a shortage\neconomy and bred corruption and nepotism. The government was\noften the cause of the problem and not the solution.\n\nThe BJP is committed to making the role of the government\nmore focused and effective by initiating a set of reforms for\nGood Governance with the same priority as economic reforms.\nSpecifically, we will make the government's interaction with\ncitizens more people-friendly and service-oriented. We will make\nthe government's principal role in the economy that of a facilitator\nand creator of the necessary environment for the creative energies\nof the people to find full expression. We will reduce discretionary\npowers vested with public authorities, and base the exercise of such\npowers on objective criteria. We will ensure exemplary punishment\nfor infringement.\n\nUntitled-10 38 11/7/2016 11:19:03 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 39\n\nThe BJP is committed to removing all non-financial barriers to\neconomic growth such as delays in clearances and decision making;\nobsolete laws, unnecessary procedures, and habitual litigation;\nlack of adequate empowerment of officers at appropriate levels;\nand lack of a level-playing field in the functioning environment\nof executives in the public sector vis-a-vis their private sector\ncounterparts.\n\n7.2 Re-orienting the Priorities of Government\n\nThe BJP believes that the thrust of the Union government in\nfuture should be on the core areas of national security, internal\nsecurity, macro-economic management, and creation and upgrading\nof infrastructure. It should also expand the scope and improve the\nquality of services and amenities in the social sector, particularly\ntargeted at the poor and disadvantaged communities. The\ngovernment's traditional function of administration and upholding\nthe rule of law and justice will have to be further strengthened.\n\nIn the economic sphere, the government should progressively\nwithdraw from involvement in non-priority sectors. It should create\nmore avenues for entrepreneurship in a well-regulated competitive\nframework. In general, it should reduce its role in manufacturing\nand services business, where the private sector can serve the people\nbetter except where it is required for strategic reasons, to prevent\nprivate sector monopolies, run important utilities, or in exceptional\ncircumstances.\n\nAt the same time, there is a need to enhance systemic\ncapabilities for better policy formulation in the social sector, better\ndesigning of schemes and programmes, and, above all, better\nmonitoring of their implementation. Towards this end, there is a\nneed to maximize community participation and involve voluntary\norganizations, professional experts at all levels. In short, efficiency,\naccountability, responsiveness, pro-poor attitude, and treating\nthe people as one\u2019s masters will be the hallmark of administrative\nreforms in the years to come.\n\n7.3 Judicial Reforms\n\nThe BJP is firmly committed to the independence of the\njudiciary. At the same time, we acknowledge that judicial bottlenecks\n\nUntitled-10 39 11/7/2016 11:19:03 PM\n\f\n40 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nhave become a major source of harassment for ordinary citizens.\nThey are also acting as an obstacle to our economy growing faster.\nTherefore, we shall speed up judicial and legal reforms on an urgent\nbasis. Our specific commitments are:\n7.3.1 Considerable enhancement in allocations to improve the\nphysical and operational infrastructure of our courts;\n7.3.2 Increasing the number of courts and appointment of more\njudges at all levels;\n7.3.3 Reform of the criminal justice system to make dispensation\nof justice simpler, quicker and more effective;\n7.3.4 Extension of Fast-Track Courts to all layers of the judiciary;\n7.3.5 Expansion of alternative dispute redressal mechanisms\nthrough Lok Adalats and Tribunals;\n7.3.6 Setting up a National Judicial Commission for appointment\nof judges and ensuring judicial ethics.\n\n7.4 Electoral Reforms\n\nThe NDA Government has introduced certain important\nelectoral reforms such as rightsizing of the Council of Ministers\nat the Centre and in States, open ballot in Rajya Sabha elections to\ncheck misuse of money power, the facility of proxy vote to defence\npersonnel, etc. We have made political funding more transparent.\nThe BJP will pursue this agenda vigorously by working towards\nstate funding of elections. We shall evolve a consensus to prevent\nentry of criminal elements into politics. In cooperation with other\npolitical parties, the BJP will consistently strive to raise the standards\nof Parliament and State Legislatures and making their functioning\nmore effective.\n\nThe BJP firmly holds that the high offices of the Indian State\nlegislative, executive and judicial should be occupied only by those\nwho are India\u2019s natural citizens by their Indian origin.\n\n7.5 Effective Empowerment of Panchayati Raj Institutions\n\nThe BJP believes in Gandhiji\u2019s philosophy that Ram Rajya\ncannot become a reality without Gram Rajya. We are committed\nto decentralisation and grassroots democracy, with the village as\nthe unit, through transfer of power from the Centre to the States,\nfrom State governments to Panchayati Raj Institutions and from\n\nUntitled-10 40 11/7/2016 11:19:03 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 41\n\nimpersonal bureaucracies to communities. We believe that effective\nempowerment of Panchayati Raj Institutions is the most urgent good\ngovernance task for achieving the cherished ideal of speedy and\nall-round rural development. The 73rd and 74th Amendments to\nthe Constitution, introduced by the Congress government, devolved\nmany important functions to Panchayati Raj Institutions. However,\nthey failed to equip these institutions with necessary financial and\nadministrative powers to discharge their Constitutional obligations.\nThe BJP will remove this shortcoming by enacting, if necessary, a\nnew Constitutional amendment.\n\nThe institution of the Gram Sabha will be strengthened.\nWe believe that it is the most effective platform for promoting\ngrassroots democracy, since it enables all the people in a village to\ndiscuss every developmental work, scrutinise the allocation and\nspending of funds, and evaluate the performance of panchayat\nand government functionaries.\n\n7.6 Improving Fiscal Health of State Governments\n\nThe BJP believes that the distortions introduced by Congress\ngovernments in the past have undermined the financial viability\nof States. Several policy and administrative measures have become\nnecessary to stop unproductive expenditure and enhance the\nresource mobilisation powers of States and institutions of local\ngovernment. The BJP will strive to build political consensus, which\nis critical for achieving this objective.\n\nThe NDA Government has initiated the process of liberating\nIndia from an overdose of controls. It has abolished many state\nmonopolies, simplified procedures, cut red tape in many places\nand eased controls. The BJP is committed to a simplified and low\ntax regime. Lower taxes encourage entrepreneurship, less tax\nevasion, a dynamic work culture and enable people to save more\nand spend more on themselves, their families and their communities.\nAt the same time, efforts will be intensified to further expand the\npopulation of tax payers to reflect the growing preponderance\nof services in our economy, ensure better compliance, and plug\nsignificant leakage of tax revenue at various levels.\n\nUntitled-10 41 11/7/2016 11:19:04 PM\n\f\n42 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n7.7 War on Corruption\n\nThe BJP believes that corruption is the greatest hurdle in\nIndia\u2019s developmental march. It has weakened the moral fabric\nof our society and polity. The long years of Congress rule have\ncreated a system of governance and administration where power is\nfrequently misused for personal gain. Ordinary citizens often have\ndifficulty getting their work done in government offices, without\npaying bribes. The BJP believes that the menace of corruption\nhas to be fought at all levels. This requires both systemic reforms\nespecially electoral and administrative reforms \u2014 and heightened\npublic action. No single political party can win the fight against\ncorruption on its own. However, the BJP is committed to playing\na leading role in its eradication.\n\n7.8 Empowering Civil Society\n\nAfter Independence, the Congress Party let the country down\non good governance. It also created an atmosphere of \u201cstatism\u201d,\nwhich made the Government machinery all-powerful and the people\nexcessively dependent on it. As a result, the people\u2019s initiative and\ntheir efforts to solve their own local problems took a back seat.\nThe Government did not sufficiently trust the organizations of\ncivil society, and the people in turn did not trust the Government\nto deliver. The lack of people\u2019s participation in government-led\ndevelopment became one of the principal reasons for India\u2019s slow\nprogress.\n\nThe BJP believes that this has to be changed by empowering\ncommunities, voluntary organizations, not-for-profit groups, and\nrespected senior citizens in society. The NGO sector, too, needs to\napply self-correctives for it to play its role in the developmental\nprocess. We believe that there is a big scope for enlisting the\ncooperation of religious establishments of all denominations,\nwhich command large followings, in schemes and programmes\nfor social development. We also believe that empowerment of the\nCivil Society will help in achieving dispute resolution ranging from\nlocal disputes over minor issues to major ones over contentious\nissues \u2014 outside the realm of the judiciary and government. This\nvision is consistent with the traditional Indian approach to dispute\nresolution.\n\nUntitled-10 42 11/7/2016 11:19:04 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 43\n\n7.9 Strengthening India\u2019s links with the Indian Diaspora\n\nThe BJP believes that the growing achievements of the vast\nIndian diaspora are a matter of pride and a source of strength for\nIndia. Similarly, India\u2019s growing strength and its rising global\nstature are also a matter of pride and a source of strength for the\nIndian diaspora. Together we constitute the Great Indian Family.\nWe are proud of the NDA Government's unprecedented efforts\nto broaden and deepen the emotional, social and economic links\nof NRIs and PIOs with their cultural motherland. These links will\nhave to be comprehensively strengthened in the years to come.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 43 11/7/2016 11:19:04 PM\n\f\nIndia and the World\n\nWith the world recognizing India as an emerging power, our foreign\npolicy has to become far more active, creative and sure-footed. This\nprocess has already begun under the NDA Government, which\nhas launched a number of bold initiatives over the past five years.\nOur Look-East Policy has greatly strengthened the India-ASEAN\nrelationship, reinforcing our close cultural links with this region\nin the past with new links in trade, technology and transport. We\nhave recently given economic cooperation within SAARC a new\nimpetus, creating the promise of free-trade in South Asia. Our\neconomic cooperation with China is growing at an amazing speed.\nWe have further strengthened our strategic partnership with Russia,\nexpanded relations with USA, intensified our dialogue with the\nEuropean Union, and rejuvenated traditional bonds with countries\nin West Asia, Central Asia, and Africa.\nThe BJP believes that this new pro-active and self-confident\nthrust of India\u2019s foreign policy should be continued. Our aim should\nbe to secure for India a steadily broadening role in international\naffairs, so that we can contribute meaningfully to the global\ncommunity\u2019s collective ability to deal with the challenges of today\nand tomorrow.\nThe broad contours of the BJP\u2019s vision for India\u2019s external\naffairs in the coming years are:\n8.1 Continue the dialogue process with Pakistan for a lasting\nsolution to all the outstanding issues, including Jammu\n& Kashmir, on the basis of the Joint Statement issued in\nIslamabad in February 2004.\n\n8.2 Work towards realizing the vision for a South Asian\nEconomic Union with a common currency for the region.\n\nUntitled-10 44 11/7/2016 11:19:04 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 45\n\n8.3 Continue the dialogue process with China to achieve a\nmutually satisfactory resolution of the boundary issue,\nwhich is an objective of strategic interest for us.\n\n8.4 Intensify efforts to create suitable alliances to secure access\nto new energy sources.\n\n8.5 Work for the creation of a cooperative multipolar world\norder, with India as one of the poles.\n\n8.6 Continue efforts to secure permanent membership of the\n\nUN Security Council.\nOo\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 45 11/7/2016 11:19:04 PM\n\f\n9. Conclusion\n\u201cShaktishali Bharat ke liye Shaktishali BJP\u201d\n\nFor the past five years, Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari\nVajpayee has given India a purposeful and dynamic government,\nending the debilitating period of destabilization perpetuated by\nthe Congress. Under him, India has entered the 21st Century with\ngreater self-confidence, vastly enhanced capacity for achievement,\nand soaring expectations.\n\nThe remarkable progress made in the past six years is,\nhowever, only a beginning. India still has a long way to realise its\nfull potential begins to flower. Inspirational leadership and good\ngovernance have put development on top of the political agenda.\nThe BJP is committed to carrying forward this process and further\nstrengthening it over the next five years and beyond.\n\nOur vision is to make India a Developed Nation by 2020; strong\nin security, strong in national unity, strong in economy, strong in\ndemocracy, strong in diplomacy, and, above all, strong in every\nparameter of human development of all her one billion people.\n\nOur vision is to make the 21st Century India\u2019s Century.\n\nHistory has chosen the BJP to provide political leadership to\nour national endeavour to realize this vision. \u201cShaktishali Bharat\nke liye Shaktishali BJP\u201d is our clarion call.\n\nA renewed and stronger mandate in Election 2004 an absolute\nmajority for the BJP and a two-thirds majority for the NDA is the\ncrucial first step to realise this dream.\n\nTo recall the Prime Minister\u2019s ringing words, \u201cIndia\u2019s destiny\nis linked to victory for the BJP and the NDA.\u201d\n\nA renewed mandate for Shri Vajpayee is a mandate for India\u2019s\nrenewal.\n\nVande Mataram!\n\nManifesto: NDA\n\nUntitled-10 46 11/7/2016 11:19:04 PM\n\f\nElection Manifesto\n\n2004\n\n \n\nAn Agenda for Development,\nGood Governance and Peace\n\nUntitled-10 47 11/7/2016 11:19:04 PM\n\f\nUntitled-10 48 11/7/2016 11:19:04 PM\n\f\nIntroduction\n\nThe first National Democratic Alliance Government was elected to\noffice in 1998. It was re-elected in 1999. Under Prime Minister Shri\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s visionary leadership, the NDA is seeking a\nrenewed mandate, in the 2004 General Election, to serve the nation\nfor another five years.\n\nThe NDA had promised to end political instability created\nby the Congress party\u2019s dangerous destabilizing tactics. We have\ndone so by giving India a stable and purposive government under\nan able leader.\n\nAdhering to the canons of \u2018Coalition Dharma\u2019 mutual trust,\nregular consultation, consensus building, and acceptance of a\ncommon approach, the NDA has shown how a coalition can work\nunitedly to fulfill the people\u2019s aspirations.\n\nWe have lived up to our 1999 manifesto declaration: \u2018The\nNDA is a representative of both national interests and regional\naspirations. The NDA is ... the mirror-image of our nation\u2019s unity\nin multifaceted diversity, rich pluralism, and federalism.\u2019\n\nThe NDA Government has taken India forward on all fronts\nduring the past five years. Our common manifesto in the 1999\nelections was called, \u2018An Agenda For a Proud, Prosperous India\u2019.\nToday, India is more prosperous than ever before. There is greater\npride, hope, and self-confidence among Indians than ever earlier.\nToday, India stands tall on the international stage, with greater\nprestige and recognition.\n\nIn five years, our country has demonstrated its ability\nto overcome the legacy of past problems and to embrace the\nopportunities of the 21st century. There is peace on the Indo-Pak\nborder, entirely due to the Government's firm but bold efforts to\n\nUntitled-10 49 11/7/2016 11:19:05 PM\n\f\n50 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nenable bilateral relations to move from seemingly never-ending\nenmity to amity. An atmosphere has been created for resolving all\noutstanding issues through dialogue. This positive development\nis pregnant with possibilities not only for India and Pakistan, but\nalso for the future of South Asia.\n\nJammu & Kashmir basks again in the sunshine of regained\npeace, well set now on the road to development. The holding of\nfree and fair elections in 2002, and the commitment to a dialogue\nprocess, has generated new hope in the State. Troubled parts of the\nNorth-East are seeing fruits of the NDA Government's consistent\npursuit of peace and conflict-resolution through dialogue. The NDA\nGovernment is now resolving the problems left in these regions as\nlegacies of long Congress misrule.\n\nWe have finally left behind our years of stagnation and slow\neconomic growth that marked most of the first fifty years of our\nindependence. A GDP growth rate of 8%, which our opponents had\ncynically derided as \u2018Mungeri Lal ke haseen sapne\u2019, has become\nreal and will be exceeded, despite the country having faced a\nstring of natural calamities. Last year, our efficient and effective\nmanagement of severe drought situation in fourteen States, was\nwithout precedent. Prices of essential commodities remain under\ncontrol.\n\nAgricultural production will surpass all previous records.\nOur forex reserves exceed the $110 billion mark.\n\nMany areas of India\u2019s manufacturing sector, earlier written\noff by critics, have now attained global competitiveness. The past\nfive years have not only brought pride to the \u2018Made in India\u2019 label,\nbut have also made \u2018Served from India\u2019 the first choice of global\ncompanies. This sunrise sector has generated new employment.\nThis new offshoot of the Knowledge Economy complements India\u2019s\nglobally recognized strengths in software exports, which have grown\nmore than five times in the last five years to cross Rs. 48,000 crore.\n\nPoor and inadequate infrastructure, which was the debilitating\nlegacy of the Congress years, has been replaced by a world-class\ninfrastructure for India, built by Indians, in India. We have set in\nmotion what the Prime Minister has aptly termed as a \u2018Connectivity\nRevolution\u2019. Telecom connectivity, Internet connectivity, highway\nconnectivity, and rural roads connectivity are just the initial, visible\nsuccesses of this revolution. We are determined to replicate these\n\nUntitled-10 50 11/7/2016 11:19:05 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 51\n\nsuccesses in other critical areas of infrastructure power, railways,\nairports, ports, irrigation, etc. where bottlenecks have severely\nconstrained economic growth and employment generation.\n\nThe past five years has seen a huge boom in housing\nconstruction. We have over-fulfilled our promise, made in 1999,\nof facilitating construction of twenty lakh new houses each year.\nWe take pride in the fact that the Vajpayee Government built more\nhouses for the rural poor under the Indira Awaas Yojana in the last\nfive years than the Congress or Congress-supported governments\ndid in the previous fourteen years since the inception of the scheme.\n\nCreating one crore additional employment opportunities a\nyear was an important promise contained in our 1999 manifesto.\nWe have substantially fulfilled that promise. Between 2000-2003, 82\nlakh employment and self-employment opportunities were created\non average each year. The Rs. 1,000-crore Sampoorna Grameen\nRozgar Yojana, started by our Government, is the biggest food-\nfor-work program since Independence.\n\nOur Government launched some of the biggest-ever social\ndevelopment initiatives in the world. These include the Antyodaya\nAnna Yojana and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. The coverage of\nthe Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), which is the\nworld\u2019s largest early childcare program, was greatly expanded.\nMajor initiatives, such as establishment of a separate ministry for\ntribal affairs, were taken to promote the cause of social justice.\n\nWe now seek a renewed term to carry forward our agenda.\nResponding to the aspirations and expectations of the people, the\nNDA has made \u2018Development\u2019, \u2018Good Governance\u2019, and \u2018Peace\u2019, as\nthe main issues for Election 2004. Our commitment to these issues\nis further affirmed in this Manifesto.\n\nIndia is prosperous, and developing. Millions of Indians\nhave got employment, bought houses, use cell phones, and are\ngetting better education for their children. Yet, millions more\nstill await their chance of benefiting from and contributing to the\nGreat Indian Dream. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's advocacy of\n\u2018Antyodaya\u2019, the NDA Government is committed to reaching the\nfruits of development to all; for we believe that the deprived and\nthe denied have the first call on the resources and the attention of\nthe Indian State.\n\nUntitled-10 51 11/7/2016 11:19:05 PM\n\f\n52 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nOur vision\nIndia as a Developed Nation\n\nOur Goal: 8 to 10% GDP growth rate on a sustainable basis\nover the next five years, with eradication of poverty by 2015. Clear\nfive-yearly milestones for economic growth and social development\nwill be set for each State and district.\n\nOur Guiding Principle: Faster growth with employment,\nequity, social justice, reduction in regional imbalances, and the\nurban-rural divide.\n\nThe NDA believes that GDP growth, at an annual rate of 8\nto 10% on a sustainable basis, is achievable. This will realize our\nstrategic vision of making India a Developed Nation. We have\nfull faith in the capacity of our hardworking kisans and workers,\nenterprising businessmen and traders, innovative managers,\nprofessionals, talented scientists, and dedicated administrators to\nachieve this goal.\n\nThe NDA is committed to making India an economic\nsuperpower through a seven-pronged strategy of:\n\n1. India as the food factory of the world.\n\nIndia as the global manufacturing hub.\n\nIndia as the service provider to the world.\nIndia as the centre of the knowledge economy.\nIndia as the global tourism destination.\n\nIndia as the global healthcare destination.\n\nNDT PWN\n\nIndia as the global higher education destination.\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 52 11/7/2016 11:19:05 PM\n\f\nAgriculture\n\nThe NDA Government gives highest priority to agriculture,\nsince it is the mainstay of India\u2019s overall development. Our main\nobjectives are:\n\n1. Bring vibrancy to the rural economy.\n\n2. Make agriculture remunerative even to small and marginal\nfarmers by doubling the income of kisans by 2010, reducing\nthe cost of cultivation, enhancing yields, and increasing\nprices receivable by farmers. We have, for the first time\nsince Independence, set up a National Kisan Commission\nto address these imperatives.\n\n3. Double the rate of growth of public and private investment\nin agriculture.\n\n4. Make India\u2019s eastern States, which have fertile land and\nplenty of water, a new food basket of India.\n\n5. Increase the access of our farmers to markets, to competitive\nsources of finance, and to knowledge that allows them to\ncompete in a global economy.\n\n6. Increase value addition and reduce wastage at every stage\nin the food chain linking the kisan to the consumer, so that\nboth benefit.\n\n7. Make India the \u2018Food Factory\u2019 of the world by producing\nhigh quality processed foods for global markets.\n\nFor achieving these objectives, the Prime Minister will formally\nlaunch the Second Green Revolution on August 15, 2004. Since\nagriculture is a state subject, the NDA will make efforts to secure\nthe participation of States in implementing the following tasks\nunder the Second Green Revolution, which will lead to an \u2018Ever\nGreen\u2019 Revolution.\n\nUntitled-10 53 11/7/2016 11:19:05 PM\n\f\n54 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nLand, Water, and Power\n\n1. Work will commence on the River-Linking Project, whose\nprincipal beneficiaries will be our farmers in water-scarce\nareas.\n\n2. Completion of all the ongoing irrigation projects (major,\nmedium, and minor) within five years to create irrigation\nfor an additional 35 million hectares of land.\n\n3. A Master Plan for ground water recharge will be\nimplemented throughout the nation.\n\n4. Mandatory community participation in planning, execution,\nand maintenance of irrigation projects through mechanisms\nsuch as Water Users\u2019 Associations.\n\n5. Every district will draw up a comprehensive water\nmanagement and soil enrichment strategy.\n\n6. Acampaign will be launched to encourage drip irrigation,\nsprinkler irrigation and greenhouse technology. Land under\nthese water-efficient systems will be increased five-fold in\nfive years. Our slogan for this campaign would be \u2018More\nCrop per Drop\u2019.\n\n7. A National Mission for Rainfed Agriculture will be launched\nto benefit two-thirds of India\u2019s cropped area, and 80% of\nsmall and marginal farmers who are dependent on rains.\nIt will focus on the watershed approach, use of better\nseeds, dissemination of relevant farm technologies, soil\nenrichment, and commercialization of everything that\ngrows on arid lands, including weeds and wild plants.\n\n8. Adequate supply of quality power will be ensured to all\nfarmers by 2009.\n\n9. Wasteland development for agriculture, horticulture,\nafforestation, bio-mass production, cultivation of bamboo\nand bio-fuels, and other productive uses will be taken\nup on a mission mode. All programs, currently under\ndifferent ministries, will be brought under a single\nagency. The National Wasteland Development Board\nwill be reactivated to put at least 25 million hectares of\nwasteland to productive use by 2009 that is, by doubling\nthe rate of coverage under all the existing programs. The\nCentre will draw up a model law for better management\nof land and other natural resources through community\n\nUntitled-10 54 11/7/2016 11:19:05 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 55\n\nparticipation, private investments, corporate-cooperative\ncollaboration, and by making landless labourers, small\nfarmers, ex-servicemen, and unemployed youth partners in\nevery initiative for wasteland development.

Greater Plan Funds shall be earmarked for agriculture,\nirrigation, rural development and allied areas.\n\n2. A Task Force will be set up to recommend, within the first\nsix months, policy and institutional measures to promote\nprivate sector investment in agriculture, especially in\nsmall and medium-scale irrigation projects, farm R&D,\nhuman resource development, post-harvest management,\nand marketing. Public and private investments, as well\nas investments by farmers themselves, will be synergized\nthrough partnerships. It needs to be underscored that\nprivate investment in agriculture does not mean corporate\nfarming.\n\n3. Timely and adequate farm credit to kisans is as important\nas timely and adequate water for his crops. Therefore,\nsteps will be taken to ensure enhanced credit flow to\nthe sector, make credit affordable at interests lower than\nprime lending rates (PLR), eliminate procedural delays,\nand introduce greater competition in credit delivery. The\nprocess of giving all eligible farmers a Kisan Credit Card\nwill be completed before August 15, 2004. Card-holders\n\nUntitled-10 55 11/7/2016 11:19:06 PM\n\f\n56 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nwill be able to use ATM facility wherever it exists. Our\naim will be to create a well-developed farm credit system,\nwhich will end the need for farmers to go to money lenders.\n\n4. Projects under the newly announced Loknayak Jaiprakash\nNarayan Fund of Rs. 50,000 crore for agriculture\ninfrastructure and credit will be given fast-track clearance.\n\n5. The Government will give priority attention to strengthening\ncooperative banks and other cooperative credit institutions.\nThe Rs. 15,000-crore fund announced for this purpose in\nthe interim budget will be made operational. Necessary\nsteps will be taken to ensure that cooperative institutions\nare run on professional and sound commercial lines, while\nretaining their democratic character.\n\n6. All States will be encouraged to bring their cooperative\nlaws in conformity with the Multi-State Cooperative Act\npassed by the Centre.\n\n7. Full support will be provided for setting up cold storages,\ngodowns, grain banks, and fodder banks. Kisans keeping\ntheir produce in accredited godowns/grain banks will\nbe entitled to avail bank credit with the introduction of\nNegotiable Warehouse Receipts.\n\n8. The comprehensive crop insurance scheme and the newly\nlaunched farm income insurance scheme will be more\nintensively and efficiently implemented.\n\nTechnology, Training, and Extension Services\n\n1. Launch of a national program to use bio-technology for\nevolving plants that consume less water, are drought-\nresistant, contain more nutrition, give higher yield, and\nare environmentally safe.\n\n2. Resources for agricultural R&D will be trebled in the\nnext five years. Its focus on new yield-enhancing and\ncost-reducing agriculture practices, new seeds, etc. To\nclose the gap between \u2018Lab to Land\u2019, multiple kinds of\npartnerships will be established between the Indian Council\nfor Agricultural Research (ICAR), Krishi Vigyan Kendras,\nagriculture universities, agri-business companies, and\nfarmers\u2019 organizations.\n\n3. Agriculture extension and consultancy services will be\n\nUntitled-10 56 11/7/2016 11:19:06 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 57\n\nmade a thrust area, with private sector participation.\nNecessary bank credit and institutional support will be\nmade available for the establishment of at least one \u2018Krishi\nSeva Kendra\u2019 in every village.

Besides benefiting farmers,\nthese agri-consultancy services will create employment\nand income-enhancing opportunities for over five lakh\neducated youth and local agriculture experts.\n\n4. Opportunities for education and training in agriculture\nand allied activities will be vastly expanded. Our aim will\nbe to ensure that every farmer undergoes some training or\nparticipates in some farm-education program every year.\n\n5. Acomprehensive, countrywide program will be launched\nfor the technological improvement of farm machinery,\nimplements, and tools.\n\nAgricultural Markets\n\n1. States will be given incentives to amend the Agricultural\nProduce and Marketing Committee (APMC) Act and\nabolish mandi taxes. This will enable farmers to access\ncompetitive markets, sell their produce directly to\nprocessing industries and to consumers, thus realizing\nbetter prices.\n\n2. All the remaining restrictions on the free movement of\nagricultural goods across any part of the country will be\nremoved within one year. The Essential Commodities Act\nwill be revised.\n\n3. ARs. 1,000 crore Mandi Development Fund will be created\nto support modernization of agriculture markets.\n\n4. Commodity exchanges will be encouraged to reach futures\ntrading services to all farmers through smaller contract\nsizes and by covering a wider range of crops. This will\nlessen the dependence on Minimum Support Prices.\n\n5. The present system of setting Minimum Support Prices\nby the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices will\nbe reviewed to further benefit all kisans.\n\n6. The present system of procurement through the Food\n\nUntitled-10 57 11/7/2016 11:19:06 PM\n\f\n58 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nCorporation of India will be revamped to make it cheaper\nto buy, store, transport, and export food grains.\n\n7. A chain of farmers\u2019 haats (markets), on the pattern of\n\u2018Ryuthu Bazaar\u2019 in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, will\nbe established throughout the country, where farmers can\nsell directly to customers.\n\nFood Processing\n\n1. The NDA believes that the food processing industry can\nmake our rural economy vibrant in the same manner that\nIT has made our national economy prosper. Currently, we\nprocess only 2% of the value of our agricultural produce.\nA Task Force shall come up with an action plan to raise\nthis to 10% in five years. It will comprehensively address\nthe main problems facing India\u2019s food processing industry:\nsize, fragmentation, inefficiency, low value-addition, low\nquality standards, and inadequate logistical support. It will\nenable the industry to meet the needs of Indian consumers\nboth at the low end and the high end. It will enable industry\nto access agriculture produce directly from farmers, and\nsuggest ways to step up exports, including to organized\nretail outlets abroad.\n\n2. Tariff and investment support for setting up food processing\nindustries, especially in backward regions, will be stepped\nup.\n\n3. The foremost task in food processing in India is to reduce\nthe distance between production and processing. Therefore,\nevery rural branch of a bank will be required to identify\nagro-processing potential in its region and finance such\nenterprises. Local administration will be required to\nprovide necessary infrastructure support. We shall set up\na chain of Primary Processing Centres close to the farmers.\nThese will sort, grade, process, store, and pack agricultural\nand horticultural produce for shipment to markets and\nfurther value-addition.\n\n4. A Unified Food Law, the lack of which is a critical\nimpediment in the faster development of food-processing\nindustries, will be enacted within the first six months.\n\n5. An independent Food Regulatory Authority will be set\n\nUntitled-10 58 11/7/2016 11:19:06 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 59\n\nup within six months. This shall be responsible for setting\nand enforcing standards for all food products.\n\n6. A Task Force will be set up, within first three months, to\nrecommend short-term and long-term measures to address\nthe problems faced by sugarcane growers and sugar mills,\nand to enable Indian sugar industry to become a major\nplayer in global markets. Production of ethanol and power\nthrough co-generation plants will be stepped up.\n\n7. India is the largest milk producer in the world. Yet, less\nthan 5% of milk production is processed. A Dairy Industry\nDevelopment Plan will be drawn up, within the first six\nmonths, with the principal aim of enhancing rural incomes\nand employment generation. It will provide increased\nfiscal and investment support for dairy units, especially in\nnorthern and eastern States. The focus of this plan will be\ndoubling capacity in five years, technology upgradation,\nexpansion of the domestic market, and realization of the\nindustry\u2019s full export potential. It will also address the\ndownstream side of the industry \u2014 better species, fodder,\nveterinary services, credit needs of kisans, etc.\n\n8. Major thrust will be given to the poultry industry to double\negg production, quadruple poultry meat production, and\nincrease exports from Rs. 250 crore to Rs. 1,000 crore. This\nis expected to increase employment in poultry from the\ncurrent 20 lakh to 50 lakh in five years. Poultry farming will\nbe recognized as an agricultural activity and all benefits\napplicable to agriculture will be extended to it.\n\n9. Anexperts\u2019 committee will be set up, within thirty days, to\nrecommend measures to minimize wastage and damages\nalong the food chain.\n\nCrops\n\n1. An action plan for massive crop diversification, multi-\ncropping, and doubling per-acre yields of all crops will\nbe prepared. Every village will be encouraged to set its\nown yearly targets. Successful farmers will be suitably\nrecognized.\n\n2. Efforts will be intensified to achieve self-sufficiency in\npulses and oil-seeds in five years.\n\nUntitled-10 59 11/7/2016 11:19:06 PM\n\f\n60 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n3. Horticulture and floriculture production will be doubled in\nfive years. Vegetable cultivation and mushroom farming,\nespecially near towns and cities will be promoted.\n\n4. Additional measures will be initiated for addressing the\nproblems faced by growers of plantation crops \u2014 tea, coffee,\ncoconut, areca nut, rubber, cashew and spices, for enabling\nIndia to retain its leadership position in these crops.\n\n5. The national missions for development of bio-fuels and\nbamboo, which were launched last year, will be made\noperational. Cultivation of medicinal plants and aromatic\nplants, which have considerable export potential, will be\nfurther promoted.\n\n6. A Technology Mission for improving jute production and\nvalue-addition will be launched.\n\nAnimal husbandry and Fisheries\n\n1. Animal husbandry, which provides full and partial\nemployment to over two crore Indians, will be fully\npromoted to achieve the ends of rural prosperity and social\njustice. A National Cattle Development Board will be set\nup with adequate budgetary support. Among other things,\nit will prepare a program for improvement of livestock\nbreeds, with a major thrust on genetic improvement\nof indigenous cattle, buffalo, and other animals linked\nto the rural economy. Establishment of Goshalas and\nPinjrapoles will be encouraged. Efforts will be made to\nevolve consensus for passing a Central legislation for\nprotection of cow and her progeny. Recommendations of\nthe newly-established National Cattle Commission will be\nimplemented.\n\n2. A National Commission for Fisheries and Aquaculture\nwill be set up for promoting all-round development of\nmarine and inland fisheries, and speedy socio-economic\nprogress of fishermen. Deep sea fishing industry will be\ndeveloped to take advantage of India\u2019s long coastline and\nits exclusive economic zone. Fishermen\u2019s cooperatives\nwill be helped to modernize their trawlers, set up cold\nstorages and processing plants, and establish direct\nlinkages with domestic and foreign markets.\n\nUntitled-10 60 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 61\n\n3. India is the second largest wool producer in the world.\nHowever, our wool industry is by and large at a low level\nof quality and value realization. An action plan will be\nprepared for its modernization and expansion. The newly\nestablished Development and Finance Corporation for the\nShepherd Community will be made operational.\n\nAgricultural Workers\n\nEffective steps will be taken to ensure sustainable year-long\nemployment, with minimum wages for agricultural workers. They\nwill be brought under the social security scheme for unorganized\nworkers and the proposed Antyodaya Swasthya Yojana. They\nwill be given priority in rural housing. Training programs for\nraising their productivity and skills will be encouraged.\n\nOther issues\n\n1. Women play a major, albeit unrecognized, role in\nIndian agriculture. A special scheme will be launched\nto empower women in kisan families, enrich their\ncapabilities, and augment their incomes.\n\n2. An extensive campaign will be launched to educate\nIndian kisans about the WTO Agreement on Agriculture,\nthe challenges and opportunities in global trade in\nagriculture after the removal of Quantitative Restrictions,\nand how a partnership between the government,\nbusinesses, cooperatives, and kisans can help the country\nmeet the challenges and capture the opportunities.\n\nThe \u2018Second Green Revolution\u2019 will follow a strategy distinctly\ndifferent from the one that defined the First Green Revolution. The\nlatter focused mostly on the popularization of high-yielding crop\nvarieties to overcome food shortage. In contrast, the Second Green\nRevolution will embrace the entire Agro-Economy, from the farmer\nto the consumer. It will harness a bouquet of new technologies,\nspace, IT, BT. It will also focus on water-efficient irrigation systems,\nenvironment-friendly pesticides, precision agriculture, agriculture\nmarkets, food processing, rural infrastructure, etc.\n\nMany of the activities mentioned above are looked after by\ndifferent Departments and Ministries. For better coordination, a\nCabinet Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will\n\nUntitled-10 61 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM\n\f\n62 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nbe set up.\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 62 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM\n\f\nRural Development\n\nThe Government's main thrust in the coming five years will be to\nbridge the rural-urban divide through implementation of the PURA\n(Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) program. Under this\nprogram, to be implemented in ten thousand rural clusters across\nthe country in five years, every cluster will be provided with four\ntypes of connectivities:\n(a) physical connectivity, which includes good roads and\npower supply;\n(b) digital connectivity, which includes modern telecom and\nIT services;\n(c) knowledge connectivity, which includes good schools and\nvocational training centers; and\n(d) market connectivity, which includes good market\ninfrastructure.\n\nSpecifically,\n* Village electrification will be completed by 2007 through\nan accelerated implementation of the program to cover 1\ncrore households and 1 lakh villages.\n\u00a2 All villages will have primary health centers within the\nvillage, dispensaries within five to eight kilometers, and\nreferral hospitals within twenty kilometers.\nPURA will be launched before August 15, 2004.\n\nRural Sanitation\n\nLack of safe drinking water and sanitation is the cause of 80%\nof all diseases and ailments. 67% of India\u2019s rural population and 22%\nof our urban population has no access to toilets. This is a source of\n\nUntitled-10 63 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM\n\f\n64 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nembarrassment and discontent among the youth, especially young\nwomen. The NDA is committed to changing this sad reality.\n\nThe Total Sanitation Campaign, launched by the NDA\nGovernment in 1999, has been a remarkable success. Necessary\nfunds will be mobilized to ensure that all the TSC projects will\nbe fully implemented in five years, ensuring that all the 8.4 crore\nuncovered rural households will have access to basic sanitation\neither their own or community-owned. There shall be no Anganwadi\ncentre or rural/urban school without water and toilet facilities by\n2005. Priority will be given to girls\u2019 schools and schools in tribal\nand remote areas.\n\nDrinking water\n\nMore than Rs. 40,000 crore have been invested in the rural\nwater supply sector during the last five decades by the Central\nand State Governments. However, the results have not been\ncommensurate with this investment, primarily because the schemes\ndid not have an in-built mechanism for people\u2019s participation,\npanchayat ownership, and bureaucratic accountability. The\nNDA Government removed this shortcoming by launching the\n\u2018Swajaldhara\u2019 program in December 2002. Under this, 90% of\nfunds on capital cost would be given by the Centre directly\nto Panchayats. The remaining 10% of the capital cost and full\nOperation and Maintenance (O&M) responsibility will be borne\nby the community.\n\nAll the existing rural drinking water supply schemes would\nbe brought under the reforms agenda of \u2018Swajaldhara\u2019 \u2014 making\nthem \u2018demand-driven\u2019 rather than \u2018supply-driven\u2019 to ensure their\nlong-term sustainability. Adequate funds will be mobilized for its\nenlarged implementation with the following commitments:\n\n(a) Every rural habitation in the country, including those\nthat have slipped back into the Partially Covered or Non-\nCovered status, will be provided an assured source of\ndrinking water supply by 2007;\n\n(b) Acommunity-based program for water quality monitoring\nwould be initiated;\n\n(c) Water supply departments and nigams of State Governments\nwould be reformed;\n\nUntitled-10 64 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 65\n\n(d) Panchayats would be given incentives for rainwater\nharvesting, raising ground-water levels, and augmentation\nand cleaning up of water sources such as village ponds,\nwells, rivulets, etc.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 65 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM\n\f\nInfrastructure\n\nThe Connectivity Revolution, which was launched by the NDA\nGovernment, and has already yielded visible results in several\nsectors, will be further accelerated. Specifically, our Government\nwill do the following in the coming five years:\n\nRoads\n\n1. Timely completion of the National Highway\nDevelopment Project (nearly 15,000 km): Phase 1 (Golden\nQuadrilateral) by 2005; Phase 2 (East-West and North-\nSouth Corridors) by 2008; Pradhan Mantri Bharat Jodo\nPariyojana (additional 10,000 km, linking all those State\ncapitals not covered by NHDP, as well as important\ncommercial centers in all the States, to NHDP with 4/6\nlane highways) by 2009.\n\n2. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana: Linking all rural\nhabitations with a population above 1,000 by 2005; linking\nall rural habitations with a population above 500 by 2007.\n\n3. Private investment in public transport systems will be\nencouraged. States will be given incentives to speed\nup restructuring of their road transport corporations.\nAt least five thousand new buses will be added to their\nfleets every year through a special fund. A separate fund\nfor improvement of all the Inter-State Bus Terminals and\nDistrict Bus Stations will also be set up.\n\n4. In addition to road construction, a program for creation\nof road services like parking facilities, hotels, shops,\nmedical facilities, business centers, food kiosks, etc. in a\nwell-planned manner, will be taken up.\n\n5. Road safety has not received adequate attention in India.\n\nUntitled-10 66 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 67\n\nAs many as 78,000 people die in road accidents each year.\nThe Government will start a National Road Safety Mission,\nwith necessary legal, regulatory, technology and mass\nawareness measures.\n\n\u2018Sampoorna Sadak Connectivity\u2019\n\nA new program called the \u2018Pradhan Mantri Pradesh Sadak\nYojana\u2019 (PMPSY) will be launched to improve all the State Highways\nand district roads in the country. These are the weak link in our\nroad network that includes world-class national highways on\none end and rapidly improving rural roads on the other end. The\nblueprint of this program, including its funding and monitoring,\nwill be prepared after detailed consultation with State Governments.\nReform of State PWDs and participation of the private sector will be\nthe highlights of this new project. PMPSY will provide the missing\nlink in the comprehensive road connectivity revolution, to be called\nthe \u2018Sampoorna Sadak Connectivity\u2019 initiative, whose other three\nlinks are already being implemented by our Government namely,\nNational Highways Development Program (NHDP), Pradhan\nMantri Bharat Jodo Pariyojana (PMBJP), and the Pradhan Mantri\nGram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY).\n\nRailways\nRailways are the lifeline of our nation. They are also the\nmost important logistical support system for the Indian economy.\nUnprecedented expansion and modernization of India\u2019s railway\ninfrastructure over the next five years will be our commitment.\n1. Implementation of works under the Rs. 15,000-crore\nNational Rail Vikas Yojana, launched in December 2002,\nwill be completed in time.\n2. Implementation of the Rs. 20,000-crore Remote Area\nRail Sampark Yojana, which was announced in the\ninterim railway budget in January 2004, will start this\nyear. Under this ambitious new initiative, all incomplete\nrailway projects in remote and backward areas of our\ncountry, whose completion by the earlier \u2018Congress speed\nof implementation\u2019 would take 20 to 25 years, will be\ncompleted within the next 5 years.\n3. We shall complete the rail connectivity from Kanyakumari\n\nUntitled-10 67 11/7/2016 11:19:08 PM\n\f\n68 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nto Kashmir, to complement the completion of the four-lane\nhighway connectivity from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, by\nspeedily implementing the Udhampur-Katra-Baramulla\nrailway line. The first ever train will roll into Kashmir\nValley before August 15, 2007, carrying the Prime Minister\nas its first passenger.\n\n4. Implementation of works under the Rs. 17,000-crore Special\nRailway Safety Fund, set up by the NDA Government in\n2002, will be completed in time. The Technology Mission\nfor Railway Safety will be made operational in 2004. Our\naim will be to reach standards of railway safety in advanced\ncountries by 2008.\n\n5.

The\n\u2018Skybus\u2019 system shall be promoted on a pilot basis.\n\n9. At least one bullet train project will be initiated.\n\n10. A Rs. 5,000-crore Railway Station Improvement Fund shall\nbe set up to improve passenger amenities in all important\nrailway stations over five years. The fund will be raised\nfrom railway users and augmented by public-private\npartnerships.\n\nRailway Reforms\n\nLong-overdue reforms in the structure and functioning of\nIndian Railways, its finances, tariff fixation, investment plans,\nand project implementation will be speedily implemented. All\nnon-core activities will be corporatized with their own effective\nboard management. Critical projects will be re-designed to attract\nnon-budgetary and private investments. The huge value hidden in\nthe assets of Indian Railways, and in its under-utilized capacities,\nwill be realized. Devolution of powers to zonal and lower levels\n\nUntitled-10 68 11/7/2016 11:19:08 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 69\n\nwill be effected. An independent Rail Tariff Regulatory Authority\nwill be set up on the lines of the Central Electricity Regulatory\nCommission.\n\nPorts and Shipping\n\n1. \u2018Sagar Mala\u2019, conceived by the NDA Government in 2003,\nis the most ambitious ever program for development\nand modernization of India\u2019s ports, shipping, shipyards,\nand inland navigation. Its aim is to make India a major\nmaritime nation in the world, harnessing the long coastline\nthat our country is blessed with. To be completed in ten\nyears, it envisages new investments of over Rs. 100,000\ncrore, coming mostly from private and foreign investors.\n\u2018Sagar Mala\u2019 will be launched before August 15, 2005.\n\n2. The operational efficiency of all major Indian ports will be\nraised to global standards within five years.

One hundred small airstrips across the country will be\nactivated for daylight flying of small passenger and cargo\nplanes. This will bring air connectivity to many district\ncenters in remote and backward areas.\n\nTelecom and IT infrastructure\n\n1. Further accelerating the revolution in telecom connectivity,\nwhich began in 1999, the number of telephones will be\nincreased from 7 crore at present to more than 30 crore\nby 2009. This will ensure that, on average, every alternate\nIndian family will have a telephone.\n\n2. No Indian village will be without telecom services after\n2007. Rural teledensity will be increased more than five-\nfold in five years.\n\n3. The number of Internet connections will be increased five-\nfold from 40 lakhs at present to 2 crore.\n\n4. PCOs will be encouraged to become multi-purpose IT\nkiosks and serve as the e-interface between citizens and\nproviders of services, including government services. These\nwill create several lakh new employment opportunities.\n\n5. Broadband communication can revolutionalize all sectors\nof the Indian economy. It can also bring about a paradigm\nchange in the content and delivery of education and\nentertainment. Therefore, a comprehensive policy will\nsoon be formulated to promote affordable broadband\nconnectivity. This will embrace all the landline and wireless\nphone users, cable TV homes, and cinema halls. Promotion\nof state-of-the-art wireless technologies will be a key part\nof this policy.\n\n6.

Implementation of a national\n\nUntitled-10 70 11/7/2016 11:19:08 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 71\n\nE-Governance strategy will begin before August 15, 2004.\nE-Seva will be made the common platform for citizens\nto pay bills for electricity, telephone, water, etc., register\nproperty, procure and submit government forms, etc.\nWe will drastically reduce the need for citizens to go\nto a government office for services which can rendered\nelectronically.\n\n7. IT in Indian languages, including in the area of content\ncreation, will be given special thrust.\n\n8. Postal services will be revamped, modernized, and IT-\nenabled to provide a range of commercial and governmental\nservices to the people.\n\n9. Every high school and every college in the country will\nbe given access to a high-speed Internet connection with\naccess to rich educational content in local languages.\n\nMeeting The Challenge Of Water\n\n1. The River-Linking Project will be launched before\nAugust 15, 2004. An initial set of identified schemes will\nbe implemented, with public participation, by 2015. An\neffective rehabilitation package for the project-affected\npersons shall be finalized and implemented.\n\n2. Massive encouragement and legislative backing for local\nand micro initiatives such as watershed management,\nrainwater harvesting, drip irrigation, de-silting of tanks,\nlakes and reservoirs, restoration of wells, recycling of\nwater, etc.\n\n3. Cleaning up of rivers and traditional water bodies, with\ncommunity participation, will be supported.\n\n4. Desalination plants will be set up in coastal towns.\n\n5. An independent Water Tariff Authority will be set up\nin each State to decide the water tariffs for industrial,\ncommercial, residential, and agricultural usage.\n\n6. Acampaign will be launched to make people aware of the\nneed to conserve every drop of water.\n\nIn view of the utmost importance and urgency of this issue,\n\na \u2018National Drinking Water Program\u2019 will be launched within the\nfirst thirty days. The Ministry of Finance will be directed to provide\nall required resources to implement this program ina time-bound\n\nUntitled-10 71 11/7/2016 11:19:08 PM\n\f\n72 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nmanner. A Task Force will be set up to work out the modalities of\nthis program, including innovative ways of financing it.\n\nPower\n\nIn 1998, the NDA Government inherited not only an\nextremely difficult power situation, but also a defective power\npolicy and a flawed sector reform program. We took immediate\nsteps to change the direction of reform and reorient the policies\nand programs with a view to setting right the situation. Priority\nwas given to reforms in distribution by providing Rs. 20,000 crore\nfor improving the distribution network and another Rs. 20,000\ncrore for giving SEBs incentives to reduce their losses. By enacting\nthe Electricity Act, 2003, the NDA Government gave a big push\nto power sector reforms. Our future commitments in this critical\nsector will be:\n\n1. Elimination of electricity shortages by 2012; significant\nreduction by 2009.\n\n2. Atleast 50,000 MW of additional generation capacity will\nbe created over the next five years. Work on projects with\na combined capacity of 12,000 MW (of which 8,000 MW\nin the private sector) will start before the end of 2004.\n\n3. Robust National Grid - 25,000 MW of power transfer\ncapability by 2009.\n\n4. SEB losses to be reduced to less than Rs. 5,000 crore by\n2009 from the current figure of Rs. 24,000 crore.\n\n5. T&D losses shall be significantly reduced.\n\n6. Power sector reforms, envisaged in the Electricity Act,\nwill be completed before end of 2004.\n\n7. Every consumer of electricity in India, including farmers,\nwould be connected through digital, tamper-proof meters\nin the next three years.\n\n8. Implementation of the 50,000 MW Hydroelectric Initiative.\n\n9. Implementation of the 100,000 MW Thermal Power\nInitiative.\n\n10. A major push for harnessing non-conventional energy\nsources. A National Program for biomass-based\ndecentralized power generation in rural areas will be\nstarted.\n\n11. Energy conservation campaign will be intensified by\n\nUntitled-10 72 11/7/2016 11:19:09 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 73\n\npromoting energy saving technologies.\n\nWe promise that the above tasks, when accomplished, will\ncreate not only a vibrant and healthy power sector, but the country\nwill experience the benefit of power sector reforms, in the same\nmanner as is being experienced in the Telecom Sector.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 73 11/7/2016 11:19:09 PM\n\f\nIndustry\n\n1. Anaction plan will be drawn up, within six months, to make\nIndia a global manufacturing hub in areas where we have\nestablished our competitive strengths: pharmaceuticals,\nautomobiles, auto-components, engineering goods. New\nindustries, especially in hi-tech areas, will be identified\nfor development of such strengths.\n\n2. In view of the good results achieved by industrial units that\nrestructured themselves in recent years, this process will\nbe further facilitated to cover all the remaining units. Our\naim will be to eliminate all idle or grossly underutilized\ncapacities in Indian industry in five years.\n\n3. Indian capital goods industry, automobile industry,\npharmaceutical industry, chemicals and petrochemicals\nindustry, gems and jewelry industry will be encouraged\nto move up the technology ladder and value chain and to\nbecome global players.\n\n4. Restructuring PSUs will be speeded up to enhance their\nprofitability. Public sector executives will be empowered to\nhave greater operational freedom and flexibility. Effective\nmeasures will be taken to stop losses incurred by ailing\ngovernment undertakings. The process of disinvestment,\nwhich yielded good results this year, will be continued\nprimarily to enhance and realize the hidden wealth in\nPSUs.\n\n5. Out of the 461 projects being monitored by the Department\nof Programme Implementation, 100 will be taken up for\nfast-track completion in two years.\n\n6. The Centre will facilitate the creation of a world-class\n\nUntitled-10 74 11/7/2016 11:19:09 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 75\n\nindustrial park in every State that is ready to lend necessary\nsupport.\n\n7.

The NDA Government is proud that a reversal of \u2018brain\ndrain\u2019 \u2014\u2018brain gain\u2019 has started in recent years, for the first\ntime in Independent India. We will convert this \u2018trickle\u2019\ninto a\u2018torrent\u2019 by creating attractive conditions for the best\nIndian talent abroad to return to India or to participate\nin collaborative work. We will also encourage foreign\nscientists and professionals to come and work here in big\nnumbers. The time has come to declare India as the land\nof opportunity for top-order talent in diverse fields.\n\nUntitled-10 79 11/7/2016 11:19:10 PM\n\f\n80 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nScience & Technology\nThe NDA believes that science and technology have a vital\nrole in the success of almost every initiative that figures in this\nAgenda\u2014from the Second Green Revolution to raising India\u2019s\nsocial development profile. We are proud that our Government not\nonly checked declining support to India\u2019s science and technology\nestablishment, but placed spending on S&T on an upward curve.\n1. Our focus in the coming five years will be three-pronged:\n(a) further encourage public and private spending on\nS&T.\n\n(b) further improve the outcome and output of this\nspending to match global standards.\n\n(c) further integrate the activities and goals of our S&T\ninstitutions with India\u2019s overarching goal of becoming\na Developed Nation by 2020.\n\n2. The Science and Technology Policy will be vigorously\nimplemented.\n\n3. Space research, peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and\ncivilian applications of defense research will be further\npromoted, building on India\u2019s self-reliant strides in these\nareas. Partnership between CSIR, DRDO, ICAR, ICMR,\nISRO, BARC, IITs, universities, and other government-\nsupported research institutions with Indian industry will\nbe speedily expanded.\n\n4. ISRO\u2019s ambitious \u2018Chandrayan\u2019 program\u2019, which aims to\nsend India\u2019s first space mission to the moon before 2008,\nwill be fully supported.\n\n5. Further steps will be taken to remove bureaucratism in\nthe functioning of our S&T institutions. Each of them will\nbe encouraged to develop a bold vision for their future\ngrowth to achieve dominance internationally.\n\n6. Fundamental research in diverse fields will be promoted.\n\n7. Recent efforts to preserve, catalogue, and develop India\u2019s\nindigenous traditions in science and technology will be\nfurther encouraged.\n\n8.

Big changes have come about in the global trade\nenvironment in the past decade or so. Simultaneously,\nIndia\u2019s ambition to become a major player in global trade is\nbeing matched by growing domestic capability. In response\nto these two trends, a separate Ministry for International\nTrade will be created to deal with the challenges and to\ncapture opportunities in global trade in a focused way.\n\n2. Special Economic Zones will be promoted as vehicles for\noverall growth. An SEZ Promotion Council, with wide\nindustry participation, will be created in the Ministry of\nCommerce as an apex body.\n\n3. Multi-commodity exchanges \u2014 both in the private sector\nand through-public-private partnerships will be promoted.\nOur focus here will be to secure for India leading positions\nin global trade in agricultural commodities, metals, and a\nwide range of other commodities.\n\n4. Organized retail trade on the international pattern will\nbe promoted as a new engine of growth for trade and\nemployment through appropriate legal and fiscal measures.\n26% FDI in retailing will be allowed. Sourcing of Indian\nproducts by foreign retail chains will be encouraged.\n\n5. India\u2019s vast market has potential for generating high\ngrowth and thereby reducing poverty and economic\ninequalities. Internal trade barriers hamper growth. They\nwill be identified and removed.\n\n6. EXIM Bank\u2019s capital base will be strengthened to enable\nit to lend more to exporters.\n\n\u2018Behtar Bazaar Plan\u2019\n\nBazaar has always been at the center of India\u2019s social life and\nplayed a crucial role in driving the economy. Removing inefficiencies\nin our markets from the village haat to wholesale markets in cities\nand introducing new efficiencies into them will be our priority. The\nCentre will work closely with State Governments on a time-bound\nplan of action, to be called \u2018Behtar Bazaar Action Plan\u2019, which will\ninclude the following initiatives:\n\n(a) Every city and tehsil town in the country will draw\n\nup its own \u2018Behtar Bazaar Action Plans\u2019, with people\u2019s\nparticipation, identifying problems and solutions thereof.\n\nUntitled-10 81 11/7/2016 11:19:10 PM\n\f\n82 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n(b) Strengthening the connectivity to markets and provision\nof adequate infrastructure facilities power, water, telecom\nand IT services, parking lots, etc. and redevelopment/\nrelocation where necessary, will be at the core of these\naction plans.\n\n(c) HUDCO and commercial banks will be encouraged to fund\nthis initiative, to be implemented through public-private\npartnerships. For markets that mainly support agriculture\nand the rural economy, this will be considered priority\nsector lending.\n\n(d) Traditional trading communities in Indian society, who\nhave a wealth of knowledge and experience in this field,\nwill be suitably encouraged.\n\nGlobalization\n\n1. The NDA Government will continue to defend India\u2019s\ninterests, especially the interests of our kisans, at the\nWorld Trade Organization. Along with other developing\ncountries, we shall work towards restraining developed\nnations from securing unfair advantages in global trade,\ninvestments, agriculture, and services.\n\n2. The NDA Government will prepare India to take advantage\nof the big shift that is currently taking place in the global\neconomy. This shift favors a low-cost economy like India\u2019s,\nwhich has developed sufficient competitive strengths in\ncost, quality and technology, over high-cost economies\nin manufacturing and services. Our Government will\nenlarge these strengths by further reforming our economy,\nmodernizing our infrastructure, enriching India\u2019s human\nresources, and augmenting our capabilities in science and\ntechnology.\n\nHousing\nThe NDA Government remains committed to the goal of\n\u2018Housing for All by 2010\u2019.\n\n1. Encouraged by the success of our program to facilitate\nconstruction of twenty lakh additional houses each year,\nwe propose to raise the target to thirty lakh each year. The\nadditional one million houses will be meant exclusively\n\nUntitled-10 82 11/7/2016 11:19:10 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 83\n\nfor weaker sections of society.\n\n2.

Anew national program will be launched to enable people\nwith kutcha houses in rural areas to upgrade them into\npucca houses.\n\n4. Cities will be encouraged to take up large-scale mass\nhousing projects for the poor and middle classes.\n\n5. States will be encouraged to repeal the Urban Land Ceiling\nAct, amend the Rent Control Act, and reduce stamp duty\non property transactions and lease agreements.\n\n6. The stock of rented houses will be vastly increased and\nrenting a house will be made easier by providing a strong,\nbut simple legal framework that protects the interests of\nboth landlords and tenants.\n\n7. Incentives will be given for investments in repairing\ndilapidated buildings.\n\nUrban Renewal\n\nThe Government will launch a major national program for\nslum improvement and rehabilitation, based on a progressive\nnational policy that harmonizes the basic living and livelihood\nrights of the urban poor with the imperative of planned urban\ndevelopment. Towards this end, the Valmiki Ambedkar Aawas\nYojana (VAMBAY), which has met with enthusiastic response,\nwill be redesigned and its scope will be widened to cover integral\ndevelopment of slum habitations. Innovative ways will be evolved\nfor raising finances, maximizing people\u2019s participation, and\nstrengthening the commitment of municipal bodies for the success\nof this initiative. The long-term aim of this initiative is to make\nIndian cities slum-free by 2020.\n\n1. Municipal governance will be strengthened.\n\n2. A model central law will be enacted to stop illegal\nencroachments. States will be encouraged to pass similar\nlegislation.\n\n3. HUDCO\u2019s lending for urban renewal projects will be\nfurther enhanced. Municipal bodies will be enabled to raise\nresources from the bond market for their urban renewable\nneeds.\n\nUntitled-10 83 11/7/2016 11:19:11 PM\n\f\n84 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n4. The size of the City Challenge Fund will be raised from\nthe present Rs. 500 crore.\n\n5. Atleast ten Indian cities will be developed as Global Cities,\nwith world-class airports, efficient mass transportation\nsystems, high quality of social infrastructure, vibrant\ncultural life and a dynamic environment for economic\ngrowth with strong global linkages.\n\n6. The infrastructure and other urban renewal needs of\nMumbai, the country\u2019s commercial capital, will be\naddressed.\n\n7. We recognize that municipal bodies have become the\nweakest link in our system of governance. Also, the\nproblems and needs of big cities have become too complex\nto be handled in old ways. Therefore, the NDA proposes\nto elevate municipal corporations in the ten proposed\nGlobal Cities to the level of City Governments, within their\nrespective States. These would be vested with requisite\nfinancial, judicial, planning, and law-enforcement powers.\nAfter evolving a political consensus on this issue, necessary\nlegislative and administrative changes will be introduced.\n\n8. At least twenty new cities and satellite towns will be\ndeveloped on completely futuristic lines.\n\n9. An Urban Road Development Fund on the lines of the\nfund for NHDP will be set up. This will fund two hundred\nflyovers a year in smaller cities and big towns, as well as\npedestrian subways and widening of roads.\n\n10. We shall create a state-facilitated, but privately funded\nand implemented program of urban mass housing for\nlower and middle classes.\n\n11. The \u2018Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan\u2019 program will be redesigned\nwith enlarged scope and enhanced resources to make our\ncities cleaner. It will be turned into a people\u2019s campaign with\nstrong government support at all levels. Adequate number\nof community toilets, ran on the pay-and-use principle,\nwill be constructed within three years in every city.\nEfficient collection and productive utilization of garbage\nwill be made mandatory. Cities and neighbourhoods that\ndemonstrate success stories will be suitably recognized.\n\nUntitled-10 84 11/7/2016 11:19:11 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 85\n\nInformal Sector\n\nA National Policy for promotion of the Informal Sector will\nbe unveiled before the end of 2004. It will provide livelihood\nprotection to millions of people engaged in this sector, by freeing\nthem from the scourge of extortion and harassment. Legal\nrecognition will be accorded to entrepreneurs and self-employed\npeople in the informal sector and their assets, so that they can\nenter into contracts, avail bank loans, benefit from various\ngovernment schemes, and get better market access for their\nproducts and services. These and other measures will help them\nthrive in their myriad occupations, and create more employment\nopportunities.\n\nSelf-help Groups\n\nSelf-Help Groups in India are already a big success story.\nOver 15 lakh SHGs have been formed so far, providing bank-\nsupported micro-finance to their members. Women\u2019s SHGs,\nunder the \u2018Swashakti\u2019 program, have been particularly successful\nin increasing family incomes of the rural and urban poor and in\nadvancing the cause of women\u2019s economic empowerment. They\nalso have the best record in repaying bank loans.\n\nBuilding on the experience so far, our Government will\nprepare an action plan to promote SHGs as a people\u2019s movement\nfor participatory economic development. Innovative partnerships\nbetween SHGs, NGOs, banks, and markets will created. The private\nsector will be involved in a big way. Special incentives will be\nprovided for women\u2019s SHGs to be formed in every neighborhood.\nThis is possible in a wide variety of occupations such as SHGs\nof handloom weavers that enable them to access yarn, improve\ndesigns, and bypass market intermediaries to get better value for\ntheir products; or women\u2019s marketing co-operatives in vegetables,\nfish and other agro-products. Northern States, and in other areas\nwhere SHGs are still weak and fewer in number, will be specially\ntargeted.\n\nWe will give a formal, legal framework to SHGs. A suitable\nlaw, enabling micro-credit operations and nurturing them to be\nscaled up, will be enacted.\n\nUntitled-10 85 11/7/2016 11:19:11 PM\n\f\n86 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nTourism\n\nAn action plan will be prepared within the first six months\nfor developing India as a major tourism destination in the world.\nOne of its important milestones would be to increase foreign tourist\narrivals from 30 lakh now to 1 crore by 2009, and 2 crore tourists\nby 2015. Its other features would be:\n\n1. A strategic marketing plan (such as the \u2018Incredible India!\u2019\ncampaign) with adequate funding will be implemented\nto achieve a strong India tourism brand.\n\n2. Higher earnings from tourism from US $3 billion at present\nto US $10 billion by 2009.\n\n3. Creation of 1 crore additional employment by 2009, and\n2.5 crore by 2015, based on the multiplier effect of tourism\non various economic activities.\n\n4. Establishment of five world-class Indian Institutes of Travel\nand Tourism on the lines of IIMs, with private investment.\n\n5.

Integrated development of India\u2019s 6,000 km-long coastline\nthrough cruise and beach tourism.\n\n7. The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) provisions will be\nrelaxed for tourism and critical urban development projects.\n\n8. Rationalization and simplification of taxes; Tax holidays\non large capital investments in tourism.\n\n9. Creation of at least two world-class theme parks based on\nIndia\u2019s civilizational and spiritual heritage.\n\n10. The North-East will be promoted in a special way to create\nnew tourism destinations for foreign tourists.\n\nDomestic Tourism\n\nA similar focused approach will be adopted for promoting\ndomestic tourism. Every district will be encouraged to prepare a\nDistrict Tourism Development Plan, harnessing its own unique\nattractions, setting targets, and offering good infrastructure and\naffordable amenities. A new thrust will be given to developing\nadventure tourism and rural tourism. A Pilgrimage Tourism\nDevelopment Fund will be created to improve infrastructure,\namenities, and cleanliness standards at 100 important centers of\n\nUntitled-10 86 11/7/2016 11:19:11 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 87\n\npilgrimage across the country in five years. Substantial contribution\nto the fund will come from pilgrims themselves, through a user\ncharge mechanism.\n\nMedia and Entertainment\n\n1. The entertainment industry occupies an important place\nin the cultural and social life of our nation. Its size, reach,\nrecognition, and influence have grown remarkably in\nrecent decades \u2014 both nationally and internationally. The\ndecisions taken by our Government have greatly helped\nIndia\u2019s film and TV industry in recent years. Both have a\nhuge potential for further growth, including in the area\nof employment generation. A National Policy for India\u2019s\nEntertainment Industry will be prepared, within six months,\nto realize its growth potential.\n\n2. A broad-based committee will be set up to formulate a\nNational Media Policy that would comprehensively address\nall the complex issues that have emerged in recent years.\n\nLabour\n\n1. The NDA Government has recently unveiled a progressive\nsocial security scheme for 37 crore people in the unorganized\nsector, the first of its kind since Independence. Its speedy\nand effective implementation will be our priority.\n\n2. We recognize that in a labor-rich society like India, our\nstrategy for achieving 8 to 10% GDP growth rate will\nhave to rest primarily on boosting labor productivity.\nTherefore, a nationwide program will be launched to\nraise labor productivity by increasing the percentage of\ntrained manpower in India\u2019s workforce from less than\n10% at present to at least 50% by 2020 with five-yearly\nmilestones.\n\n3. The working of Employees State Insurance Corporation\n(ESIC) will be reviewed and necessary steps will be taken\nfor its improvement.\n\n4. Recommendations of the Second Labor Commission will\nbe implemented with necessary modifications to further\nstrengthen welfare, training, and employment creation\nprovisions.\n\nUntitled-10 87 11/7/2016 11:19:11 PM\n\f\n88 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nEnvironment Protection\n\nThe NDA views the depletion of India\u2019s precious environmental\nassets with great concern. We believe that sustainable development\nis possible with the effective protection of all our environmental\nassets.\n\n1. Building on the recent achievement in increasing India\u2019s\nforest cover, further measures will be taken to promote\nafforestation, social forestry and agro forestry. States where\ndepletion has reached critical levels will receive greater\nattention. Joint Forest Management, which institutionalizes\ncommunity partnership, will be further strengthened.\n\n2. Vehicular pollution will be controlled by stringent standards\non all motor vehicles at the manufacturing stage itself and\nby promoting the use of clean fuels.\n\n3. Environment impact assessment of development projects\nand industrial clusters will be strengthened.\n\n4. Development of \u2018Green\u2019 technologies will be further\nencouraged.\n\n5. Regulation of pollution control norms will be decentralized\nto States and local self-government bodies so that the\npeople suffering from pollution have a say in the mitigation\nprocess.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 88 11/7/2016 11:19:12 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 89\nEmployment Generation\n\nThe NDA is committed to the goal of eradicating unemployment.\nOur Government will continue to follow a strategy of accelerated\neconomic growth, which is capable of generating gainful employment\nfor all those who can work. An essential aspect of this strategy is\nthe recognition that the nature of employment generation in India,\nin line with trends in many other countries, has changed with\nthe changing nature of our economy. Employment generation in\ngovernment offices and in the capital-intensive segment of industry\nhas a reduced role in this strategy. However, employment and\nself-employment opportunities are coming up on a large scale in\nservices and in the unorganized sector whose relative weightage\nin the Indian economy is steadily growing.\n\nThis new trend of employment generation is already visible\nin many parts of India. Many young people are finding jobs and\nself-employment in different service sectors in not just big cities but\nalso in small towns. These are not jobs in the traditional sense, but\nthey offer opportunities and new challenges for personal growth.\nOur Government will fully support this trend through necessary\npolicy and institutional measures, including through provision of\nsocial security to people in the unorganized sector.\n\nIn the NDA\u2019s common manifesto in 1999, we had promised\nto create one crore additional employment and self-employment\nopportunities each year. This commitment shall continue. We will\nfollow a three-pronged strategy to fulfill this promise:\n\n(a) Sustaining a high GDP growth rate of 8 to 10% yearly; a\nfast growing economy will create more employment and\nself-employment opportunities;\n\nRaising the employment-elasticity of the economy by\nfocusing the growth in the employment-generating sectors\nof the economy;\n\n(c) Enlarging the scope of government schemes that create\nemployment, such as the food-for-work Sampoorna\nGrameen Rozgar Yojana. Such schemes will receive greater\nbudgetary support in 100 backward districts.\n\nAs has been indicated in this document, our Government\n\nwill continue to promote many initiatives that have considerable\n\n(b\n\neS\n\nUntitled-10 89 11/7/2016 11:19:12 PM\n\f\npotential for employment generation for different sections of our\nsociety. In rural areas these are: agriculture and agro-processing,\nwasteland development, agro-forestry, social forestry, dairy, poultry,\nanimal husbandry, agriculture extension services, cottage industries,\nself-help groups, housing and road construction, transportation, etc.\n\nIn urban areas, we will promote employment, self-employment\nand entrepreneurship opportunities in retail trade, housing and\nconstruction, food, transportation, tourism, services in the informal\nsector, telecom and IT, manufacturing, garments, entertainment,\nfinancial services, education and training, etc.\n\nEnhancing the employability of employment-seeking youth,\nin line with the changing needs and opportunities in the economy\nwill be made a priority. Employment is fundamentally linked with\neducation. Therefore, we have affirmed our commitment to carry out\na major overhaul of our school and college education.

The NDA has taken India into a new orbit of accelerated\ndevelopment, coupled with peace on our borders and harmony\nwithin.\n\nAs we seek a renewed and bigger mandate in 2004, we ask to\nbe judged by our performance in the last five years as well as by\nthe vision and programme that we have laid out in this Agenda.\nWe are proud to have raised the bar of performance higher, and\nare keenly aware that the Indian voter now expects more.\n\nWe believe in the principle of accountability. We promise to\ngive a six-monthly report on the status of implementation of the\ncommitments made in this Agenda.\n\nPrime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has placed an\nenergizing vision of India as a Developed Nation. The NDA\nrededicates itself to realizing this vision in partnership with the\npeople of India.\n\nOo\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 115 11/7/2016 11:19:16 PM\n\f\nFor a Proud,\nProsperous India\n\nAN AGENDA\n\f\nNational Democratic Alliance\n\nElection Manifesto\n\n1999\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 117 11/7/2016 11:19:16 PM\n\f\nUntitled-10 118 11/7/2016 11:19:16 PM\n\f\nIntroduction\n\nTHE 1999 General Election is an unnecessary imposition. It was\nthrust upon the country by a motley combination that put political\nnegativism, narrow personal interests and greed for power far\nabove the national good. The Government led by Shri Atal Bihari\nVajpayee lost the vote in the Lok Sabha on April 17 by just one and\nthat too questionable vote. In spite of promising a new government\n\u2018in five minutes\u2019 and futilely attempting widespread defections,\nthis negative coalition by the Congress failed to come up with\nany alternative arrangement, forcing the dissolution of the Lok\nSabha and fresh elections. A serving, performing Government was\nneedlessly destabilised.\n\nHardly had the country absorbed the shock of this avoidable\nuncertainty, then we were faced by Pakistani armed intrusion into\nKargil.\n\nThe Government rose to the challenge and acted decisively.\nFaced by this aggression in Kargil, the response of the Government\nwas swift, though measured.\n\nThe last of the Pakistani intruders were cleared from the Kargil\nSector on 27th July.\n\nWe salute the heroism, dedication and selflessness of our armed\nforces. We dedicate ourselves anew to preserving the honour and\nterritorial integrity of our motherland. We reiterate our commitment\nto look after the welfare of the armed forces, and of the dependents\nof all those that laid down their lives in service of our motherland.\n\nThe security of the nation is our paramount duty. In fulfillment\nof this sacred duty we will ensure that the neglect of defence\npreparedness by the previous governments during the last decade\nshall be corrected. The defence of India and the needs of our armed\n\nUntitled-10 119 11/7/2016 11:19:17 PM\n\f\n120 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nforces is our commitment.\n\nThis General Election allows the country a great opportunity of\nfinally putting an end to the era of political negativism, uncertainty\nand dynasticism. In this hour of national challenge, when the faith\nof the people in democratic institutions is under test it is vital that\nall nationalist forces join hands. This is the moment to look ahead,\nto a new, resurgent India.\n\nIn Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the country has a leader\nwho blends tradition with modernity, a leader who understands\nIndia and the world and a statesman who is accepted by all sections\nof the country. In just 13 months, the Vajpayee Government\nset new parameters of purposeful governance. In the realms of\nnational security, regional cooperation, economic modernization\nand centre-state relations, the Vajpayee Government has shown\nthe way forward. Under Shri Vajpayee\u2019s leadership the National\nDemocratic Alliance seeks a firm and resounding mandate to\ncomplete the unfinished agenda.\n\nThe National Agenda for Governance of the National\nDemocratic Alliance constitutes the basis of our joint commitment\nfor a stable Government to take India into the new millennium.\nOn this occasion we appeal for a new political age of reconciliation\nand accord based on our principled commitment to:\n\n\u00a2 National Security - ensuring full combat effectiveness of\nour armed forces;\n\n\u00a2 National Reconstruction - an end to divisiveness and a\nmoratorium on contentious issues;\n\n\u00a2 Dynamic diplomacy - In service of motherland to obtain\nfor India it\u2019s rightful place in the comity of nations;\n\n\u00a2 Federal harmony ensuring a partnership of the Centre and\nStates;\n\n\u00a2 Economic Modernization - harnessing technology for\nrapid, equitable growth;\n\n\u00a2 Secularism - the emotional harmony of all Indians and\nfull protection of minorities;\n\n* Social justice - empowerment of all weaker sections and\ngender rights; and\n\n\u00a2 Probity - transparency of decision-making and corruption-\nfree governance.\n\nWhen the whole nation was thrown into the vortex of political\n\nUntitled-10 120 11/7/2016 11:19:17 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 121\n\ninstability because of the toppling of the Government headed\nby Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, by the irresponsible combination\nof Congress, the left parties and their old and new found allies;\nwhen the whole nation felt that it was duped and deceived by\ntheir chicanery because they could not fulfill their boast of an\nalternative Government in \u2018five minutes\u2019 - even for several days;\nand when the whole nation was on the verge of loosing faith in\nour democratic system was getting cynical about politics and\npoliticians; the signatory political parties came together as an act\nof national commitment and founded the National Democratic\nAlliance (NDA), under the leadership of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee,\nto set the Indian polity on a new course for the future.\n\nThe reason for creating the NDA is to lift the spirit of the\nnation at large, to draw its people together and, most importantly,\nto rebuild the bonds of common purpose that are the very roots of\nour democratic polity.\n\nThe NDA came into being because of an historic need and\nrealisation amongst us that our young democracy cannot bear\nthe fits and tremors of frequent elections which will undermine\nthe peoples\u2019 faith in the democratic process. Therefore, with a\nconsensus on a common cause and a common set of principles we\nhave sunk our differences to weld ourselves into a solid phalanx\nof a single dominant political formation and thereby we fulfill the\nresolve of the Indian people to give themselves a stable, strong\nand progressive Government.\n\nWeare proud that the NDA is representative of both national\ninterests and regional aspirations - after all the NDA is nothing but\nthe mirror-image of our nation\u2019s unity in multifaceted diversity,\nrich pluralism and federalism.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 121 11/7/2016 11:19:17 PM\n\f\nOur Mission\n\nTHE NDA\u2019s mission in politics is to build a bond of trust between\nGovernment and people. This is the only way a democracy can\nflourish; but unfortunately has been ignored during the last 50\nyears of one-party rule.\n\nTherefore, the NDA pledges to the people of India a\nGovernment which shares their hopes and anxieties and which\nwill work as partner with all people irrespective of class, caste\nand religion - not just with a privileged few. This is our contract\nwith the people.\n\nThe NDA is new; the NDA is the future and the NDA is a\nbroad- based movement for progress and justice.\n\nOur vision is one of national renewal with modern programmes\nof change for a resurgent India.\n\nWe reach out to the minorities and even at the cost of repetition\nproclaim that we will safeguard the rights as enshrined in our\nConstitution. NDA is the political arm of none other than the Indian\npeople as a whole. No one will be cast aside; fairness and justice\nwill be rendered to one and all and we assure you that there will\nnot be any discrimination.\n\nWe appeal to our brothers and sisters of the minorities that we\nwhole-heartedly extend our hands of friendship, in these fraternal\nwords:\n\nLet us hold hands and walk together to build a resurgent,\nmodern India.\n\nLet us throw away our old prejudices.\n\nLet us put an end to divisiveness.\n\nLet us have a moratorium on contentious issues.\n\nLet us bind ourselves with bonds of trust and friendship.\n\nUntitled-10 122 11/7/2016 11:19:18 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 123\n\nWe want an India which we all feel part of, in whose future\nwe all have a stake. And we want to enter the new millennium\nwith confidence; not with divisive feelings.\n\nThis is our call for reconciliation and it is part of our\ncommitment to the minorities.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 123 11/7/2016 11:19:18 PM\n\f\nAgenda For Governance\n\nA Commitment to Good Governance\n1. Our first commitment to the people is to give a stable,\nhonest, transparent, and efficient government capable\nof accomplishing all-round development. For this, the\ngovernment shall introduce time-bound programmes of\nneeded administrative reforms including those for the\nPolice and other Civil Services.\n\nEconomy\n2. We will continue with the reform process, give it a strong\nSwadeshi thrust to ensure that the national economy\ngrows on the principle that \u2018India shall be built by Indians\nreappraise and revitalise reforms through giving primacy\nto removal of unemployment, and to an accelerated\ndevelopment of infrastructure, particularly energy and\npower production. We will bring GDP growth to the\n7-8% bracket, and control deficits - fiscal and revenue.\nWe will examine the possibility of enacting a Fiscal\nResponsibility Act. We will take all such steps as would\nexpedite implementation of policies and programmes in\naccordance with our national interests; and give to the\nentire national development efforts a humane face with\ntotal eradication of poverty as the ultimate goal. For this\n\u2018Berozgari Hatao\u2019 - eradicate unemployment - is our\ncall. Swadeshi is not reinventing the wheel. It means that\nwe will facilitate the domestic industry to gain enough\nmuscles to compete with the multinationals in the local\nand global markets. We want domestic companies to\n\nUntitled-10 124 11/7/2016 11:19:18 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 125\n\nflourish and acquire a Trans National status. At the\nsame time the country cannot do without FDI because\nbesides capital stock it brings with it technology, new\nmarket practices and most importantly employment.\nOur target is to achieve at least $10 billion per year which\nwill commensurate with our growth objectives. The old\nleftist approach sought complete state control of industry\nwhile the rightist approach wanted to leave everything\nto the market. We reject both. Government and industry\nmust work together to achieve key objectives aimed at\nenhancing the dynamism of the market with effective and\nefficient regulatory mechanisms. In fact the issue is not\nabout capitalism or socialism, nor is it about market or less\nstate. It is about better society, about improving the way\ncitizens can demand and obtain all sorts of public goods.\nIt is about dignity for all. We firmly resolve that poverty\nshould be relegated to history like slavery, colonialism,\nsmall pox and cholera and we should meet the challenge\nof mobilising resources for that by undertaking the\nchallenge of restructuring priorities and mainstreaming\nthese priorities into new programmes of pro-poor growth\nand redistribution towards poverty eradication-That is\nhow we plan to eradicate absolute poverty within this\ngeneration-within the first decades of 21st century-and\nwe strongly feel that it is feasible and affordable, infact,\nit is a moral imperative which we will not miss.\n\n3. We will carefully analyse the effects of globalisation,\ncalibrate its process by devising a timetable to suit\nour national conditions and requirements so as not to\nundermine but strengthen the national economy, the\nindigenous industrial base and the financial and services\nsectors.\n\n4. We will earmark 60% of the Plan Funds for and effect public\ninvestment in agriculture, rural development, irrigation\nand by diverse incentives, including tax shelters, achieve a\nquantum leap in agricultural production so that agriculture,\nhorticulture, forestry, food processing, fisheries and so on\nbecome the vehicles for growth resulting in an enhancement\nof the purchasing power of the people. Effective crop\n\nUntitled-10 125 11/7/2016 11:19:19 PM\n\f\n126 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\ninsurance schemes will be introduced. Special efforts will\nbe made in Animal Husbandry, Dairying, particularly in\nrespect of Cow and its progeny. This is one of the routes\nto generating employment, thus eradicating hunger and\npoverty in rural as well as urban areas. Subsidies of all\nkinds will be implemented in such a manner that maximize\nbenefits to all section of the agricultural population.\nDevelopment of medium and small scale irrigation projects\nshall receive priority attention; emphasis for investment\nwill be in accordance with the potential for development.\n\n5. We will adopt a National Water Policy which provides\nfor effective and prompt settlement of disputes and their\ntime-bound implementation. We will examine and take\ntime-bound steps to link Ganga-Cauvery Rivers. Sethu\nSamudharam Canal Project will also be undertaken.\n\n6. We will increase the national savings to 30% of the GDP in\nthe next five years by appropriate incentives and through\nmotivation; encourage Foreign Direct Investment in core\nareas so that it usefully supplements the national efforts\nand discourage FDI in non-priority areas.\n\n7. We will institute a comprehensive study of the financial,\ntechnological and social security requirements of the\nself-employed and unincorporated sector; also constitute\na Development Bank to promote this largest segment of\nthe national economy which, too, has great employment\nand self-employment potential. Further, in addition to\nfinancial support institutions we will bring into being other\ninstitutional systems for providing services, technology\nand marketing facilities for artisans, the small-scale,\nvillage, khadi, powerloom, handloom, handicrafts and\nsuch other industries. This and the Agriculture sectors are\nan untapped source with unlimited scope for generation\nof employment.\n\n8. We will give a major thrust to infrastructure development,\nparticularly energy and power, by recommending public\nexpenditure in the sector. Towards this we will access\nlong-term funds in the national and international markets,\nremove administrative bottlenecks, reverse the slowdown\nin this critical area of national economy thus giving a fresh\n\nUntitled-10 126 11/7/2016 11:19:19 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 127\n\nimpetus to growth. Private Sector participation will be\nencouraged.\n\n9. We will undertake a review of all laws and regulations\nrelating to industry so as to free it from bureaucratic control;\ninstitute a system of voluntary compliance with laws,\nincluding tax laws; ensure speedy redressal of industrial\nsickness arrange for meaningful interaction between\nindustry and government; and revive the capital market\nas a viable and transparent mechanism for raising capital.\nWe will also expedite comprehensive reform of the PSUs,\nincluding restructuring, rehabilitation and divestment.\n\nTrade & Commerce\n10. We will focus on specific products in specific growth\nareas for exports and announce specific packages for\nhorticulture EoUs.We intend to strongly support attempts\nto build a system of trade and economic cooperation\nthrough expanded global system of trade preferences\n(GSTP) among developing countries. We would also assert\nmore robustly India\u2019s national interests, especially at the\nforthcoming review conference of the WTO, scheduled for\nNovember 1999. A healthy commodity exchange system\nwill be established to be managed in an autonomous way.\n\nLabour\n11. We will make labour, both organized and unorganized,\nan equal and proud partner in the production of the\nnation\u2019s wealth and in its progress. Laws relating to equal\npay for equal work for men and women shall be strictly\nimplemented.\n\nUntitled-10 127 11/7/2016 11:19:19 PM\n\f\n128 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nEradication of Unemployment\n\n12. Recognizing the right to work of every citizen, the main\nthrust of the new government will be: \u2018Berozgaari Hatao\u2019\n(Eradicate Unemployment). As against the present trend\nof jobless growth, our government will measure growth\ngeneration of gainful employment. Our new investment\nand institutional thrust to agriculture, the self-employed,\nthe unincorporated sector, infrastructure development and\nhousing will act as the vehicles for massive employment\ncreation at all levels.\n\n13. The Alliance will embark upon a strategic pro-poor policy\nin terms of which those living below the poverty line are\nnot to be pitied but treated as a net resource replete with\ntheir own ideas and experience well in tune with local\nconditions. Every effort will be made to provide them\nwork locally and ensure that schemes for their welfare are\ncompetently and honestly administered. They themselves\nwill be treated as participants and facilitators in this noble\nventure. The services of NGOs, well versed in this field\nand, preferably originating locally, will also be enlisted\nwherever considered necessary.\n\nFood Security and Price Stability\n14. We will ensure food security for all, create a hunger-free\nIndia in the next five years, and reform and improve the\nPublic Distribution System so as to serve the poorest of\nthe poor in rural and urban areas. We will also ensure\nprice stability by all appropriate means and necessary\nlegislation.\n\nHealth and Drinking Water\n15. We will spare no efforts to ensure that potable drinking\nwater is available to all villages in the next five years. Age\nold and traditional methods of water utilisation, in both\nrural and urban areas, will receive urgent attention.\n\nEducation for All\n\n16. We are committed to a total eradication of illiteracy. We\nwill formulate and implement plans to gradually increase\n\nUntitled-10 128 11/7/2016 11:19:19 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 129\n\nthe governmental and non-governmental spending on\neducation upto 6% of the GDP: thus to provide education\nto all. We will implement the constitutional provision of\nmaking primary education free and compulsory upto 5th\nstandard. Our aim is to move towards equal access to and\nopportunity of educational standards upto the school\nleaving stage. We shall strive to improve the quality of\neducation at all levels \u2014 from primary schools to our\nuniversities.\n\nHousing for All\n\n17. Shelter is a basic human requirement that needs to be met\nona priority basis. We are, therefore, committed to evolving\na National Housing and Habitat Policy in consultation\nwith State Governments, aimed at providing Housing\nfor all. Towards this end, we shall facilitate construction\nof 20 lakh additional housing units annually. As in other\nprogrammes, the emphasis will be on the benefit to the\npoor and the deprived.\n\nEmpowerment of Women\n\n18. We will legislate for the reservation of 33% of the seats in\nParliament and State Assemblies for women; also institute\nplans for providing free education for girls upto college\nlevel, including professional courses, so as to better\nempower women. We will also set up a Development\nBank for women entrepreneurs in the small scale and tiny\nsectors.\n\nHarnessing Yuva Shakti\n19. The youth of our country constitute the majority of our\npopulation. They are the strength of the family, village,\nlocality and the community, they are also the future of\nour nation. We will take all necessary steps to mobilise\nthis most idealistic, inspired and energetic section of our\nsociety in the mission of nation-building. For this purpose,\nwe shall build national consensus for the creation of a\nNational Reconstruction Corps aimed at environmental\nprotection ecological tasks, reclamation of waste land,\n\nUntitled-10 129 11/7/2016 11:19:20 PM\n\f\n130 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nincluding afforestation, and for spreading literacy. We will\nhave a time bound programme for promotion of sports.\n\nChildren\n20. We will present a National Charter for Children. Our aim\nis to ensure that no child remains illiterate, hungry, lacks\nmedical care. We will take measures to eliminate child\nlabour.\n\nPopulation\n\n21. We are committed to achieving population stabilization\nby 2010 through improved access to primary health\nservices, universalisation of primary education, delivery\nof contraceptive services to Mohalla/Ward/Basti level and\nthrough betterment of educational and socio-economic\nposition of women.\n\n22. Schemes for providing income generating training to\nwidows will be worked out in cooperation with the state\ngovernments.\n\n23. India today has a much larger population of senior citizens\nand their numbers are expected to rise substantially. It\nwill be our endeavour to assure them that they continue\nto remain esteemed and valuable members of society.\n\nConstitutional and Legal Reforms\n\n24. Weshall appoint a Commission to review the Constitution of\nIndia not only in the light of experiences and developments\nsince 1996 but indeed, of the entire post-independence\nperiod, and to make suitable recommendations.\n\n25. Weare convinced that there is a clear case for devolution\nof more financial and administrative powers and functions\nto the States. We will take suitable steps to ensure\nharmonious Centre-State relations in the light of the\nrecommendations of the Sarkaria Commission and also\neffect decentralisation right upto the grass roots level by\nactivating and involving Panchayats and local bodies.\nStates of the Union where the percentage of population\nbelow the poverty line has increased during the last five\ndecades shall receive special attention. A Backward Area\n\nUntitled-10 130 11/7/2016 11:19:20 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 131\n\nCommission for each state of the Union to identify least\ndeveloped areas and recommend comprehensive measures\nfor their development shall be instituted. A Committee\nwill be set up to study the feasibility of treating all 19\nlanguages included in Schedule 8 of the Constitution as\nofficial languages will examine problems of Border States\nfor amelioration and take measures for ensuring a fixed\nterm (5 years) for all elected bodies including legislatures.\nWe will also examine replacing the present No Confidence\nMotion with the German system of \u2018Constructive vote of\nNon-confidence\u2019.\n\n26. We will introduce necessary electoral reforms on the basis\nof the recommendations of the Goswami Committee, the\nInderjit Gupta Committee and the Law Commission Report\nso as to deal with the malaise of defections, corruption\nand criminalisation of politics, and to prevent electoral\nmalpractices.\n\n27. Revitalise NE Council; ensure territorial integrity of the\nstates of the NE; special developmental, administrative\nand security related programmes.\n\n28. We will set up a National judicial Commission which\nwill recommend judicial appointments in High Courts\nand Supreme Court and draw up a code of ethics for the\njudiciary. We will enact legislation to provide an eligibility\ncriteria that the high offices of State-legislative, executive\nand judicial are held only by naturally born Indian citizens.\nWe will establish a National Register of citizens. We will\nalso introduce a multi-purpose identity card for all citizens.\n\n29. We will undertake all necessary legislative and\nadministrative measures to ensure the right of franchise\nof the Armed Forces through proxy voting and or any\nother method.\n\nCorruption\n\n30. We will enact the Lok Pal Bill with adequate powers to\ndeal with corruption charges against anyone, including the\nPrime Minister. In the administration of justice, we shall\nnot allow discrimination between the rich and the poor,\nthe empowered and the powerless; restore the majesty of\nlaw, and the objectivity of the state.\n\nUntitled-10 131 11/7/2016 11:19:20 PM\n\f\n132 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nNew States\n31. We will give full statehood to Delhi and also create\nUttranchal, Vananchal and Chhattisgarh as new States.\n\nNational Security\n\n32. In today\u2019s unipolar world it is of paramount importance\nthat India constantly maintains and strengthens the state\nof preparedness, morale and combat effectiveness of our\nArmed forces.\n\n33. The recently established National Security Council will\nadvise the government in this regard and also in the\nestablishment of a credible nuclear deterrence. These are\nthe minimum requirements in this recently inaugurated era\nof global inequality and increased vulnerability. The NDA\nwill correct the imbalance and budgetary neglect of Defence\nneeds during the last decades by successive governments\nthus ensuring adequacy of budgetary allocation! We will\ntake effective measures for eliminating all pensionary\nanomalies. We will revamp the entire system of welfare\nof ex-servicemen as a tribute to those that laid down their\nlives for the country.\n\nInternal Security\n34. We are committed to ensuring the safety and security of\nall citizens in all parts of the country. For reaching this\ngoal we will take effective steps to create a riot-free order\nand a terrorism-free India.\n\nInternational Relations\n35. In the past 13 months the government demonstrated its\ncapability to secure for India a place, role and position\nin the global arena, commensurate with its size and\nimportance. We have also shown that our desire for peace\nand friendship should not be interpreted as weakness but\nas a firm resolve that aggression shall not be permitted to\nsucceed. We have effectively engaged with the international\ncommunity and obtained a high degree of understanding.\nThis engagement process shall be developed to improve\n\nUntitled-10 132 11/7/2016 11:19:20 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 133\n\nIndia\u2019s standing in the international community.\n\nWe will promote and strengthen regional groupings on the\nlines of SAARC and ASEAN, and reorient our diplomacy\nto pursue economic, commercial goals and energy security\ngoals. We will strongly support any attempt to build a\nsystem of trade and economic cooperation through an\nexpanded global system of trade preferences (GSTP) among\ndeveloping countries. We will seek to assert more robustly\nIndia\u2019s national interests, especially at the forthcoming\nreview conference of the WTO, scheduled for December,\n1999. We are committed to making the voice of India as the\nvoice of the developing world.\n\nGenuine Secularism\n\n36. We are committed to establishing a civilised, humane\nand just civil order; that which does not discriminate on\nground \u2014 of caste, religion, class, colour, race or sex. We\nwill truly and genuinely uphold and practise the concept\nof secularism consistent with the Indian tradition of \u2018Sarva\npanth samadara\u2019 (equal respect for all faiths) and on the\nbasis of equality of all. We are committed to the economic,\nsocial and educational development of the minorities and\nwill take effective steps in this regard.\n\nSCs, STs and Backwards Classes\n37. The interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and\nBackward Classes will be adequately safeguarded by\nappropriate legal, executive and societal efforts and by\nlarge scale education and empowerment. We will provide\nlegal protection to existing percentages of reservation in\ngovernment employment and educational institutions at\nthe Centre and State level. If required, the Constitution\nwill be amended to maintain the system of reservation.\nWe will continue to offer all assistance to the SCs, STs\nand Backward Classes to ensure their speedy socio-\neconomic development. We will remove the last vestiges of\nuntouchability from our society. Further, we will present\na National Charter for Social Justice (Samajik Nyay) based\non the principle of social harmony (Samajik Samarasata).\n\nUntitled-10 133 11/7/2016 11:19:21 PM\n\f\n134 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nWe are committed to extending the SC/ST reservations\nfor another 10 years. Reservation percentages, above 50%,\nas followed by certain states shall be sanctified through\nnecessary legislative measures.\n\nEnvironment\n\n38. We will establish an appropriate legal framework for\nthe protection of the environment and unveil a National\nEnvironment Policy to balance between development\nand ecology. A Vanvasi Fund for the benefit of Vanvasis\nshall be established. To discourage poaching of Wild Life\na Wild Life Anti-Poaching Authority shall be established.\nThe Ganga and Yamuna rivers\u2019 cleaning programmes shall\nbe revamped and revitalised. Similar schemes for other\nwater bodies shall also be initiated.\n\nPrasar Bharti\n39. We will review the Prasar Bharti Act. We will also enact\na comprehensive Broadcasting Bill to regulate private\nbroadcasting and to protect Indian interests. We will restrict\nforeign equity holding in private television broadcasting\nto 20% (and prevent cross holding to avoid emergence of\nmonopolies in the media).\n\nA New Norm For Governance by consensus\nScience & Technology\n40. For sustainable national development and the long-overdue\n\ntransformation of India into a modern, prosperous and\nknowledge-driven nation, we will ensure integration\nof efforts, in the field of science and technology with\ndevelopment programmes in various socio-economic\nsectors. We will further speed up the modernization of\nNational Laboratories, strengthen R&D and establish new\nas well as strengthen existing centres of excellence, so that\nthey continue to constitute an invaluable national asset\nand also become totally immune to policy fluctuations\nelsewhere.\n\nUntitled-10 134 11/7/2016 11:19:21 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 135\n\nInformation Technology\n\n41. A new revolution is sweeping the globe \u2014 that of\nInformation Technology. We believe that Information\nTechnology is an important vehicle for future development.\nWe are committed to ensuring that India is full and equal\npartner in this global progress; indeed, India can be a\nsoftware super power. We will, for that purpose, unveil\na National Informatics Policy with short, medium and\nlong-term perspective.\n\n42. Finally, we are convinced that a nation of nearly 100\ncrore people representing a sixth of humanity cannot be\ngoverned on the arithmetic alone of majority and minority.\nGovernance must become unifying, not divisive, in its\npractice. It is this mindless manner of the domination\nof the majority that has led to bitterness, hostility and\nconfrontation - and has even made the opposition and\nruling parties like permanent adversaries. This destructive\ntrend of politics of negativism and political untouchability\nwhich has distorted our body politic in the last few decades\ncalls for an immediate corrective. We will, therefore,\nstrive to develop national consensus on all major issues\nconfronting the nation by involving the opposition parties\nand all section, of society in dialogue. We will also try for\na consensual mode of governance as far as practicable.\nThis National Agenda is a sincere and solemn covenant\naimed at changing the content and culture of governance\nof this great nation, freeing it of the triple curses of hunger\n(bhookh), fear (bhay) and corruption (bhrashtachar), and\ntransforming it into a New India that is prosperous, strong,\nself-confident and at peace with itself and the world. We\nappeal for the cooperation of all parties and all sections\nof society in this great endeavour.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 135 11/7/2016 11:19:21 PM\n\f\n136 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\nConclusion\n\nThis National Agenda is a sincere and solemn covenant aimed at\nchanging the content and culture of governance of this great nation,\nfreeing it of the triple curses of hunger (bhookh), fear (bhay) and\ncorruption (bhrashtachar), and transforming it into a New India\nthat is prosperous, strong, self-confident and at peace with itself\nand the world.

Shanti! Shanti!\nMay all live happily. May all enjoy good health.\nMay all see auspiciousness. May none experience distress.\n\nMay peace prevail everywhere!\n\nTHIS timeless motto of universal happiness and peace is the heritage\nof this ancient Indian civilization, which assumed the character of\nBharatvarsha in Bharat Khand. Here, a nation, which Megasthanes\nnoted \u2018never invaded others and was never invaded,\u2019 existed long\nbefore the ideas of civilization evolved elsewhere.\n\nThis ageless nation is the embodiment of the eternal values\nenshrined in the concept of \u2018Sanatana Dharma\u2019 which, according to\nMaharishi Aurobindo, is synonymous with Indian nationalism. The\nidea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u2014world as a family \u2014is integral to\nthe concept of Sanatana Dharma. This gigantic idea is an exclusively\nIndian contribution to world peace. This ancient nation evolved a\nworld-view based on the motto Loka samasta sukhina bhavantu (Let\nthe entire world be happy) thousands of years before any League\nof Nations or United Nations was thought of to avoid global strife.\nThe Indian nation evolved this grand vision not by marching its\narmies and conquering the rest and offering peace; but by the\ninner-directed pursuit of universal values by the Rishis living in\nthe forests and mountains of India.\n\nThe well-being of all, in short, is the Indian mission. It is not\n\nUntitled-10 141 11/7/2016 11:19:21 PM\n\f\n142 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nlimited to the residents of Bharat or the adherents of any particular\nfaith or creed. That is why Bharat received with open arms all faiths\nand people fleeing persecution \u2014 whether it was the Jews, Parsis,\nMuslims or Christians\u2014and preserved and protected them long\nbefore any other civilization could think short of exterminating those\nwho differed from the ruling faiths and people. Israeli society has\nopenly acknowledged that out of over a hundred nations in which\nJews sought refuge, only in Bharat they were received and treated\nwell. It is because religion in ancient India meant faith in general\nand not any particular faith. It is this ancient Indian mind that\nformulated the Constitution of India, guaranteeing equal treatment\nto all faiths and their adherents and it is not the Constitution that\nshaped the Indian mind.\n\nDiversity is an inseparable part of India\u2019s past and present\nnational tradition. The BJP not only respects but celebrates India\u2019s\nregional, caste, credal, linguistic and ethnic diversity, which finds\nits true existence and expression only in our national unity. This\nrich tradition comprises not only the Vedas and Upanishads,\nJainagamas and Tripitaka, Puranas and Guru Granth Sahib, the\nDohas of Kabir, the various social reform movements, saints and\nseers, warriors and writers, sculptors and artists, but also the Indian\ntraditions of the Muslims, Christians and Parsis.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party is a proud inheritor of this\ntradition while all other political parties have branded everything\nassociated with this great tradition as sectarian, unworthy of being\nfollowed. The post-Independence tendency to reject all ancient\nIndian wisdom in political life led to all pre-Independence values\nand symbols \u2014be it the idea of spiritual nationalism expounded\nby Swami Vivekananda, or the concept of Ram Rajya articulated\nby Mahatma Gandhi, or the soul-stirring \u201cVande Mataram\u2019 song\ncomposed by Bankim Chandra being discarded as unsecular and\nunacceptable. The BJP rejects this attitude and idea of disconnecting\nfrom the past. The past is inseverable from the present and the\nfuture. That is why Swami Vivekananda said, \u2018It is out of the past\nthat the future is moulded. It is the past that becomes the future\u2019.\n\nBJP\u2019s Vision: An Inheritance From India\u2019s Freedom Movement\n\nTHE BJP shares, embodies and energizes the vision of every\npatriotic Indian to see our beloved country emerge as a strong,\n\nUntitled-10 142 11/7/2016 11:19:22 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 143\n\nprosperous and confident nation, occupying her rightful place\nin the international community. It is a vision to see our sacred\nMotherland freed from the scourge of bhookh (hunger), berozgari\n(unemployment), bhay (fear) and bhrashtachar (corruption). Lastly,\nit is a vision to see India, the world\u2019s oldest cradle of civilization,\ntransform itself yet again into a benign global power, contributing\nher material, intellectual, cultural and spiritual energies to\nchange the paradigm at the global level to save the world from\nthe gathering civilizational crisis. As Arnold Toynbee said, \u2018The\nWestern beginning must have an Indian ending if the world is to\nbe saved from destruction.\u2019\n\nIt was this very same vision which inspired millions upon\nmillions of freedom-loving Indians of all castes, communities and\nregions to give their all for the liberation of Mother India from the\nyoke of British colonial rule. It was a vision which all the stalwarts\nof our freedom movement, belonging to different ideological and\npolitical backgrounds, said in their own separate yet complementary\nways. Mahatma Gandhi coined a uniquely Indian idiom\u2014\u2018Ram\nRajya\u2019 \u2014for this common national vision, emphasizing, as a\ncautionary direction to future rulers of India that, \u2018There can be no\nRam Rajya in the present state of inequalities in which a few roll\nin riches and the masses do not get even enough to eat.\u2019\n\nThe Context and the Issue in the 12th Lok Sabha Poll\n\nTHE general elections to the 12th Lok Sabha is the inevitable\nresult of the instability forced on the country by the Congress and\nthe United Front. The two formed a negative and opportunist\ncombination to thwart the mandate of the people in the 11th Lok\nSabha poll and allowed the rejected Congress Party to do back-\nseat driving. The negative combination was a symbol of instability\nfrom day one and was, for most part of its existence, in intensive\ncare. It collapsed, as it had to and demonstrated how the mischief\nplayed on the people of India after the 11th Lok Sabha poll recoiled\non the mischief-makers themselves. This has made stability the\nprincipal issue in the coming election in a manner it has never\nbeen in our history.\n\nAlso, the election to the 12th Lok Sabha is not only a vote on\nthe despicable record of malgovernance of the two United Front\nregimes spawned by the hung 11th Lok Sabha. Rather, as the last\n\nUntitled-10 143 11/7/2016 11:19:22 PM\n\f\n144 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nparliamentary poll in this century and as one taking place in the\nSwarna Jayanti year of India\u2019s Freedom, it is a vote on nearly five\ndecades of misrule by the Congress and its clones.\n\nThe BJP and its allies have entered the electoral fray with\nthe supreme confidence of winning a clear mandate from the\npeople of India to rule for the next five years. This mandate will\nbe a vote not only against the rank instability of the two United\nFront Governments, but also against the static, anti-people, anti-\ndevelopment \u2018stability\u2019 of the previous Congress Governments.\nAt the same time, it will be a positive vote for the BJP\u2019s solemn\npledge to provide a dynamic, pro-people, pro-development, anti-\nstatus quoist stability under the able Prime Ministership of Shri\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nShri Atal Bihari Vajpayee: Ability, Integrity and Universal\nAcceptability\n\nTHE positive vote for the BJP is grounded in our philosophy,\nour policies, our programmatic commitments, the performance of\nour State Governments and, of course, the unimpeachable personal\nqualities of our top leadership. In Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the\npeople see a leader who combines ability with integrity, charisma\nwith character and experience with universal acceptability. He is\nnot a person who claims leadership by birth in, or relationship with,\nany dynasty. He is a leader by virtue of his long and dedicated\nservice of the nation and its people in and out of Parliament.\n\nUnder Shri Vajpayee\u2019s leadership, the BJP and its allies, if\nelected to power, will marshal the requisite will to chart the way\ntowards the fulfillment of the unfinished agenda of transition from\nSwaraj to Su-raj.\n\nThis Election Manifesto outlines how the BJP will effect change\nwith continuity. It asserts the principles and beliefs that will serve\nas the beacon and an internal watchdog for the BJP in governance.\nThe five-fold concept of Shuchita (probity in public life), Suraksha\n(security), Swadeshi (economic nationalism), Samajik Samarasata\n(social harmony) and Hindutva (cultural nationalism) will constitute\nthe core content and ideological pillars of the BJP. These principles\nwill be manifest in our commitment to national security, good\ngovernance, national unity and integration, democracy, genuine\nsecularism, eradication of mass poverty, opportunity for economic\n\nUntitled-10 144 11/7/2016 11:19:22 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 145\n\nadvancement for all, social justice, gender justice, harmonious\nCentre-State relations, probity in public life, revival of institutions,\npolitics of consensus and cooperation as against confrontation and,\nlast but not the least, raising India\u2019s prestige, profile and power in\nthe international arena.\n\nThese commitments will guide the BJP in its endeavor to\nprovide a Stable Government under an Able Prime Minister.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 145 11/7/2016 11:19:22 PM\n\f\nOur National Identity\n\nCultural Nationalism\n\nTHE BJP is committed to the concept of \u2018One Nation, One People\nand One Culture\u2019. The unique cultural and social diversity in India\nis woven into a larger civilizational fabric by thousands of years of\ncommon living and common and shared values, beliefs, customs,\nstruggles, joy and sorrow, as well as symbols of high degree of unity\nwithout uniformity. Our nationalist vision is not merely bound by\nthe geographical or political identity of Bharat but it is referred\nby our timeless cultural heritage. This cultural heritage which is\ncentral to all regions, religions and languages, is a civilizational\nidentity and constitutes the cultural nationalism of India which is\nthe core of Hindutva. This we believe is the identity of our ancient\nnation \u2018Bharatvarsha\u2019.\n\nEvery effort to characterize Hindutva as a sectarian or exclusive\nidea has failed as the people of India have repeatedly rejected sucha\nview and the Supreme Court, too, finally endorsed the true meaning\nand content of Hindutva as being consistent with the true meaning\nand definition of secularism. In fact, Hindutva accepts as sacred all\nforms of belief and worship. The evolution of Hindutva in politics\nis the antidote to the creation of vote banks and appeasement of\nsectional interests. Hindutva means justice for all.\n\nThe BJP is convinced that Hindutva has immense potentiality\nto re-energize this nation and strengthen and discipline it to\nundertake the arduous task of nation-building. This can and does\ntrigger a higher level of patriotism that can transform the country\nto greater levels of efficiency and performance. It is with such\nintegrative ideas in mind, the BJP joined the Ram Janmabhoomi\nmovement for the construction of Shri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. This\n\nUntitled-10 146 11/7/2016 11:19:23 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 147\n\ngreatest mass movement in post-Independence history reoriented\nthe disoriented polity in India and strengthened the foundation of\ncultural nationalism.\n\nThe BJP is committed to facilitate the construction of a\nmagnificent Shri Ram Mandir at Ram Janmasthan in Ayodhya\nwhere a makeshift temple already exists. Shri Ram lies at the core\nof Indian consciousness. The BJP will explore all consensual, legal\nand constitutional means to facilitate the construction of Shri Ram\nMandir at Ayodhya.\n\nOo\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 147 11/7/2016 11:19:23 PM\n\f\nAgenda for Institutional Rejuvenation\n\nStrengthening Democracy\u2019s Pillars\n\nTHE strength of a democracy is directly proportionate to the\nstrength of the three pillars on which it rests\u2014the Executive, the\nLegislature and the Judiciary. Five decades of misrule and misuse\nof these institutions has eroded their strength. Corruption at the\nhighest levels of the Executive has corroded people\u2019s faith in\nGovernment. The Congress and UF Governments\u2019 inability to take\nfirm decisions and make tough choices, apart from their failure to\nconfront disruptive forces, has weakened the authority of the Indian\nState. Over-centralization of power at the Centre and unbalanced\nmodels of development have led to Centre-State friction. Abuse\nof constitutional provisions like Article 356 and the misuse of Raj\nBhavans as extension counters of the ruling party at the Centre\nhave defiled the sanctity of the country\u2019s Constitution.\n\nThe BJP will earnestly set itself to the task of strengthening\nthese institutions of the Republic through an agenda of reform\nand rejuvenation. The primary task is to restore to the State\u2014 and\nthus to Government \u2014its honour and prestige. The BJP will thus\nrestore to Government its moral authority to rule. We propose to\nundertake the following agenda for rejuvenation:\n\nConstitutional Reforms\n1. The BJP will appoint a Commission to comprehensively\nreview the Constitution of India, in the light of the\nexperience of the past 50 years and make suitable\nrecommendations. The Commission will comprise\nconstitutional experts and eminent parliamentarians.\n2. The BJP is committed to take necessary steps to prevent\n\nUntitled-10 148 11/7/2016 11:19:23 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 149\n\nmisuse of Article 356 of the Constitution.\n\n3. The BJP will carve out Uttaranchal, Vananchal, Vidarbha\nand Chhattisgarh as separate States. Delhi will be given\nfull Statehood.\n\n4. The BJP will provide all three regions of Jammu and\nKashmir \u2014Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh\u2014with regional\ndevelopment councils.\n\n5. The BJP will abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution.\n\nElectoral Reforms\nTHE BJP, which has been singularly championing the cause\nof electoral reforms since the days of the Jana Sangh, believes that\none of the principal causes of corruption and corrosion of our\npolity is our faulty election process. The BJP will, immediately\non assuming office, introduce a comprehensive Electoral Reforms\nBill, much of the groundwork for which has already been done\nbut not acted upon. To ensure free, fair and fearless elections and\nto prevent the use of money power and muscle power, the BJP\nwill:\n1. Update and adopt the Goswami Committee Report;\n2. Consider introducing a scheme for State-funding of election\nexpenses incurred by all recognized parties;\n3. Undertake immediate delimitation of Lok Sabha and\nAssembly constituencies;\n4. Make it mandatory for parties to submit audited accounts\nfor public scrutiny;\n5. Examine the feasibility of introducing the list system or a\nmixed system of elections; and;\n6. Undertake the process of issuing multi-purpose identity\ncards to all citizens and make it a mandatory requirement\nfor voting.\n\nJudicial Reforms\n\nTHE Judiciary is one of the watchdogs in a democracy and\nin recent times has played an important role in pursuing cases\nof corruption and abuse of public office. But the Judiciary faces\nproblems that need to be addressed and solved in consultation\nwith the Chief Justice of India. For speedy, fair and inexpensive\njustice, the BJP will:\n\nUntitled-10 149 11/7/2016 11:19:23 PM\n\f\n150 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n1. Fill vacancies in high courts and the Supreme Court without\nany delay;\n\n2. Appoint special judges to clear the huge arrears at all\nlevels of the judiciary;\n\n3. Legislate to the effect that cases are heard on a day-to-day\nbasis and not held up by inordinate adjournments;\n\n4. Expand and strengthen the existing legal aid facilities for\nweaker sections of society; and,\n\n5. Set up a National Judicial Commission which will\nrecommend judicial appointments in the High Courts\nand the Supreme Court and draw up a code of ethics for\njudges.\n\nReforms in the Law and Order Machinery\n\nTHE security of each citizen is of utmost concern for the BJP,\nwhich is committed to a riot-free and terrorism-free India. Whether\non the streets or at home, every Indian must feel safe and protected\nfrom violence in any form. The BJP will squarely and purposefully\naddress the deteriorating law and order scenario in various parts\nof the country. The BJP will:\n\n1. Forthrightly meet all challenges to the State and its citizens\nby terrorists and extremists. Our approach will be firm\nbut always fair;\n\n2. Enact a suitable law to tackle terrorism while ensuring\nthat there are no loopholes for its misuse;\n\n3. Provide timely assistance to State Governments to maintain\nlaw and order by supplementing local police forces with\nadequate central forces;\n\n4. Equip police with modern arms and communication\nfacilities;\n\n5. Seek immediate reports from State Governments on\nincidents of police firing and monitor follow-up action,\nespecially in fixing of responsibility if the firing was\nunprovoked or uncalled for;\n\n6. Hold district officers squarely accountable for\nmismanagement of public order and take prompt action\nin light of findings of time-bound inquiries;\n\n7. Ensure that complaints by citizens do not go unattended;\n\n8. Improve the intelligence-gathering mechanism at all levels\n\nUntitled-10 150 11/7/2016 11:19:23 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 151\n\nto tackle mischief-makers before they can act and keep\nState Governments posted about all intelligence gathered\non a day-to-day basis;\n\n9. Launch a nationwide drive to identify the influx of illicit\narms and their possession. Proliferation of small arms\ndirectly affects law and order and the nation\u2019s security;\n\n10. Crack down on narcotics smuggling which is linked to\nnarco-terrorism and drug-usage. Existing law in this regard\nwill be made more effective and implemented;\n\n11. Rationalize the number, structure, composition and role of\nparamilitary and special forces like the National Security,\nthe Special Protection Group and the Rapid Action Force;\nand,\n\n12. Review VIP security arrangements so that they are neither\nexaggerated nor intrusive. We will ensure that VIP security\narrangements do not affect the collective convenience of\nthe citizens.\n\nAdministrative Reforms\n\nTHE BJP believes that despite reduction in the traditional\nregulatory role of the bureaucracy, it will remain vital to the\nprovision of a just and progressive administration; efficient delivery\nof services to the people; and, implementation of socio-economic\ndevelopment programmes. We will strive to re-inculcate in the public\nservice the spirit of service to the common people. Public servants\nat all levels will be given due support and trust. In turn, they will\nbe held fully accountable for efficiency, probity and integrity. To\nusher in a responsive and responsible administration, the BJP will:\n\n1. Ensure objectivity and fairness in recruitment, promotions\nand transfers.\n\n2. Introduce suitable minimum tenures for officers manning\nsuch posts as secretaries to the Government, chief\nsecretaries, DGPs and district officers;\n\n3. Deny extension to officers after superannuation or upon\ncompleting their fixed tenures;\n\n4. Give protection to public servants in the discharge of their\nduties and disallow interference from extraneous quarters;\n\n5. Undertake reforms in district administration, police and\nother organizations interfacing with the people, with\n\nUntitled-10 151 11/7/2016 11:19:24 PM\n\f\n152 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nemphasis on responsiveness and accountability;\n\n6. Avoid proliferation of bureaucracy by meeting new\nrequirements, to the extent possible, through redeployment\nand training of existing staff;\n\n7. Give wide publicity to rights of citizens and the services\nand facilities to which they are entitled;\n\n8. Provide speedy redressal of individual and community\ngrievances;\n\n9. Withdraw Government from areas of unnecessary\nintervention;\n\n10. Enhance skills and efficiency of public servants through\nspecial training programmes;\n\n11. Infuse talent through lateral entry of personnel;\n\n12. Ensure speedy resolution of anomalies in implementing\nthe recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission and\nstrengthen arrangements for employees\u2019 welfare and\nhousing;\n\n13. Raise the retirement age of Government employees from\n58 to 60 as per the recommendations of the Fifth Pay\nCommission; and,\n\n14. Increase skills and efficiency of public servants by training\nprogrammes; infusion of talent will also be secured by\nlateral entry of people from the private sector, NGOs and\neducational and research institutions.\n\nRestructuring of Centre-State Relations\n\nTHE present iniquitous Centre-State relations not only tend\nto erode the autonomy of the States and jeopardize their rightful\nand legitimate role in our federal polity, but also impinge on their\nfinancial capabilities and operational flexibility. To make Centre-\nState relations more harmonious and in keeping with the spirit of\na federal polity, the BJP will:\n\n1. Immediately implement the recommendations of the\nSarkaria Commission;\n\n2. Consult State Governments before appointing Governors\nand consider ways and means of preventing misuse of Raj\nBhavans for political purposes;\n\n3. Increase allocation of resources to the States in real terms.\nThis, coupled with greater functional autonomy, can go a\n\nUntitled-10 152 11/7/2016 11:19:24 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 153\n\nlong way in making States stable, strong and prosperous.\n\nTo achieve this end, we will:\n\n(a) Increase the States\u2019 share of gross proceeds of Central\nTax revenues to 33 per cent;\n\n(b) Give adequate assistance to the States to lessen the\nburden imposed by the recommendations of the Fifth\nPay Commission;\n\n(c) Allow States the freedom to raise funds by issuing\ntax-free bonds;\n\n(d) Transfer external assistance to States on the same terms\nand conditions on which it is received from external\ndonors;\n\n(e) Treat loans against small savings as loans in perpetuity;\n\n(f) Increase Plan assistance to States in real terms;\n\n4. Swiftly clear infrastructure projects in power, water and\nmineral sector. The Central Electricity Authority and\nCentral Water Commission will function as consultancy\norganizations and not have any regulatory role in project\nclearance. The present policy of environmental clearance\nwill be reviewed.\n\nPanchayati Raj\nFOR better local self-governance at the village level, the BJP\nwill:\n\n1. Introduce suitable changes in the 73rd and 74th amendments\nto the Constitution with a view to further strengthening\nPanchayati Raj institutions and giving them greater\nautonomy;\n\n2. Endeavor to make the Panchayati Raj institutions financially\nself-reliant.\n\nSystemic Cure for Corruption\n\nTHE BJP believes that morality and ethics together form the\nunderpinning of good governance. In the past 50 years, the Congress\nhas systematically dismantled all norms of honesty and integrity\nin Government, indulging in corruption at all levels and resisting\nall attempts to bring the guilty to book. The UF had declared its\nintention to expose the corrupt, but ended up protecting them\nfrom the arms of justice. The BJP will seek to undo this grievous\nwrong committed against the nation by the Congress and later by\n\nUntitled-10 153 11/7/2016 11:19:24 PM\n\f\n154 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nthe UF and set an example of unimpeachable accountability and\nimpeccable probity in public life. For a clean public life, the BJP will:\n\n1. Make it obligatory for every elected representative to\nmake public within 90 days his income and assets, as well\nas those of his/her spouse and dependent children and\nparents. These declarations will be open to public scrutiny\nand have to be made every year;\n\n2. Appoint a Lok Pal to inquire into allegations of corruption\nagainst anybody holding public office, including the Prime\nMinister;\n\n3. Introduce extensive regulations to ensure that conflict of\ninterest does not influence decisions taken by those holding\npublic office;\n\n4. Modify and reform the methodology of Government\napproval of contracts, schemes and large value agreements\nto make them more transparent;\n\n5. The powers of patronage, the discretion to say \u2018Yes\u2019 or\n\u2018No\u2019 to simple daily requirements of the citizens will be\ndone away with;\n\n6. Expeditiously deal with unresolved cases of corruption\nand in which no action has been taken in the last 12 years;\nand,\n\n7. Give greater autonomy to the CBI, in keeping with the\nrecent Supreme Court order, so as to prevent investigating\nagencies from being used to subserve the political designs\nof the ruling party.\n\nRight to Information\nTHE BJP believes in taking concrete steps to promote\ntransparency in the functioning of Government as a confidence-\nbuilding measure. The working of a Government should not only be\ntransparent but should be perceived to be so. We, therefore, subscribe\nto the principle of sharing information about the Government's\nwork. The BJP will:\n1. Enhance public access to information to the maximum\nextent feasible;\n2. Review laws and regulations concerning confidentiality;\nand,\n3. Introduce social audit of development programmes,\n\nUntitled-10 154 11/7/2016 11:19:24 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 155\n\nespecially in rural areas.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 155 11/7/2016 11:19:24 PM\n\f\nOur Swadeshi Approach\n\nMaking India a Global Economic Power\n\nTHE economic policy-making in the last five decades has been\nshaped more by dogma than by a rational debate on what suits\nthe country\u2019s interests best. In 1950, Congress discarded the\nGandhian approach and adopted the socialist pattern without\nany debate. Now, after the collapse of the socialist paradigm, our\nentire establishment has defected to the type of free-market system\nthat prevails in the Western countries, once again without any\ndebate as to whether such a system can be wholly transplanted\nto India. The policies of liberalization, particularly globalization,\npursued by the Congress and later by the UF Government have\nresulted in economic stagnation. What this nation needs now is a\npractical approach that is devoid of dogma and is guided wholly by\nconsiderations of national interest and what is appropriate for us.\n\nFifty Years of Wasted Opportunities\n\nIN fact, the five decades of Congress and quasi-Congress rule\nhave been a virtually wasted opportunity. In these fifty years the\nabsolute numbers of people living below the poverty line almost\ndoubled; the Indian economy grew at a mere 3.5 per cent while\nmost of Asia raced ahead towards prosperity. At the same time,\nIndian industry, services and agriculture were largely rendered\ninternationally non-competitive and disadvantaged. During\nmost of this period the BJP and its forerunner, the Bharatiya Jana\nSangh, had been urging a liberal economic regime in which the\nfull creative genius of the Indian people could flower. We opposed\nthe license-permit Raj. We opposed the command economy. We\nopposed senseless central planning. We opposed the inefficient State\n\nUntitled-10 156 11/7/2016 11:19:25 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 157\n\ncapitalism that was promoted at the cost of our entrepreneurial class.\nWe opposed the crony capitalism that came about as a result of the\ncollusion between the politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.\nWe opposed the nationalization of vast areas of the economy. We\nopposed the corruption that inevitably became a part of the system\nthat was created. We continuously opposed the Congress party that\nwas both the creator and then the creature of this corrupt system.\n\nPhony Liberalization: A More Impoverished Economy\n\nAFTER four-and-a-half grossly wasted decades, the Congress\nGovernment of the day woke up to the bankrupt reality, but, under\nthe guise of correcting the past wrongs, actually surrendered to\nIMF conditionalities. With a gun at its head it began to do what it\ndoes best \u2014 double talk. It said it was liberalizing the economy and\nactually gave itself more opportunities for corruption. This phony\nliberalization turned out to be a period of record loot under which\nforeign companies flourished and the Indian ones floundered. Within\nthe first year, as the Finance Minister crowed that the surge in the\nshare market was a sign of confidence in his policies, the bubble\nburst to uncover a scam of record proportions. Foreign companies\nwere allowed to increase their equity at par instead of paying the\nmarket price for additional shares. Over 2,100 companies were\nallowed to raise over Rs. 35,800 crore from the market, mostly at\nunreasonable premia. The markets have since come down to abysmal\nlevels; as a result millions were financially devastated. More than\n600 of these companies, which cumulatively raised over Rs. 10,000\ncrore, have simply disappeared, walking off with the money. The\nCongress Party has no answer for this. Many in the Cabinet were\ndirectly involved in the scams. The then Prime Minister\u2019s office,\ntoo, was not exempt from this taint.\n\nThe last six years, when the much-touted reform has been\nunder way, have been years of extreme difficulty for the common\nman. The wholesale price index of food grains has gone up by over\n70 per cent, which is an effective inflation rate of over 20 per cent.\nInstead of creating prosperity for all, this so-called liberalization\nfurther impoverished the majority with a result that, according\nto the NCAER, 59 per cent of all households now have a monthly\nincome of less than Rs. 1,000 or about Rs. 200 per person which is\nmuch less than the poverty level monthly per capita income of Rs.\n\nUntitled-10 157 11/7/2016 11:19:25 PM\n\f\n158 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n263! By contrast, only 4.1 per cent of all families have an income of\nover Rs. 40,000 per year. A study by Oxfam, while somewhat more\ncharitable as far as the overall figures are concerned, categorically\nstates that rural poverty during the Manmohan Singh years grew\nfrom 35.5 per cent to 48.6 per cent. After this period of so-called\nliberalization and growth, so much hyped by the Congress and\nlater by the quasi-Congress UF Governments, we have become a\nmore impoverished society than before. According to the World\nDevelopment Report, the highest 20 per cent of Indians accounted\nfor 41.3 per cent of the national income, while the bottom 20 per cent\naccounted for a mere 8.8 per cent! The hollowness of the economic\npolicies of the past fifty years and, in particular, of the past seven\nyears stands totally exposed by the glaring inequity and the high\nincidence of poverty.\n\nFrom 1981-82 to 1990-91 industrial production grew at\nan average of 7.8 per cent a year. After five years of so-called\nliberalization it grew at an average of 5.7 per cent. During the\nperiod 1990-96, in a reversal of the previous decade\u2019s performance,\nthe compound growth rate of foodgrain production was 1.7 per\ncent while the population grew at 1.9 per cent. Consequently, the\nper capita availability of cereals, which was 511 grams in 1991,\nhas come down to 464 grams now. It is small wonder that prices\nof cereals alone have gone up by almost 20 per cent in 1996 while\nthose of vegetables have risen by a huge 63.3 per cent. The prices of\nwheat and onions have spiraled while those of luxury cars, mobile\nphones and color TVs have come down. This is indicative of the\nwarped sense of economic and social justice that has been prevailing\nin our country in the past few years. Instead of waking up to the\ndeteriorating foodgrain scenario, successive Governments have\nbeen neglecting agriculture. In 1996-97, the proposed outlay for\nagriculture was Rs. 1,969 crore or Rs. 349 crore over the previous\nyear\u2019s revised estimate. This did not even cover the official inflation\nand the impact of the Pay Commission\u2019s recommendations.\n\nThe Swadeshi Approach: Reforming the Reforms Process\n\nIN 1991, the BJP cautioned the Government to embark upon\ninternal liberalization first and defer globalization. We advocated\nthe reinstatement of the Swadeshi idea particularly because of\nthe heavily one-sided pro-West WTO in the offing. However, ina\n\nUntitled-10 158 11/7/2016 11:19:25 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 159\n\nmatter of five years, the BJP stand on Swadeshi has been vindicated.\n\nSwadeshi simply means \u2018India First\u2019. This is the governing\nprinciple of all nations. Now the idea of Swadeshi is being accepted\nin most quarters, also by the Indian industry. Nevertheless, the\neconomy of India has come under tremendous pressure because\nof misguided tariff reductions and an uneven playing field for\nthe Indian industry. The BJP is fully aware that, when it comes\nto power, it will be inheriting a badly managed economy and a\nbadly directed reform process. The broad agenda of the BJP will\nbe guided by Swadeshi or economic nationalism.\n\nThe fundamental approach of the BJP is that it is imperative to\ndevelop a collective national will and confidence that \u2018India shall\nbe built by Indians\u2019. National development will largely depend\nupon national effort and national capital and savings. Even after\nthe so-called reforms, the share of FDI in national investment is\nless than 2 per cent, that is, out of the total national investment\nof over Rs. 12,30,000 crore, FDI amounted to only Rs. 18,500 crore\nduring the years 1991 to 1996. It is clear that foreign capital will\nbe only of little value to the national economy, though crucial to\nsome sectors like infrastructure.\n\nEvery nation advocates free trade in all global fora, but, in\npractice, they compulsively resort to quotas, tariffs and anti-dumping\nmeasures to protect their national interests. Whether it is the USA\nwhich resorts to Super 301, anti-dumping and high tariff, or it is\nJapan whose market is very difficult to access even now, the story is\nthe same. While the declared agenda is free trade, the undeclared,\nbut actual, agenda is economic nationalism. India, too, must follow\nits own national agenda. This spirit is Swadeshi.\n\nRole of Government in a Liberalized Regime\n\nTHERE is a great misconception about the role of the\nGovernment in a liberalized regime. There is an impression that\nthe Government retreats leaving the hidden hand of the market to\nmanage the economy. Governments all over continue to actively\nmanage and protect their economies, national industry and\nemployment. The paradox is that, the greater the liberalization, the\nmore demanding is the involvement of the Government to protect\nnational industry and employment.\n\nUntitled-10 159 11/7/2016 11:19:25 PM\n\f\n160 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nFull Liberalization and Calibrated Globalization\n\nTHE Government and Indian industry need to evolve a\nconsensus on the time span required to enable our industries to\nadjust to the exacting demands of international competition. It means\nrapid, large-scale internal liberalization, but calibrated globalization\nso that the Indian industry gets a period of seven to ten years for\nsubstantial integration with the global economy. On the basis of\nthis consensus, the Government and the industry should work out\na strategy to create an atmosphere of international acceptability\nand manage external relations, particularly with the WTO.\n\nIndia must move carefully and gradually towards integration\nwith the global economy and even as it so does, it must act in a\nmanner that suits its national interest. This strategy recognizes\nthat Indian industry needs a period of transition before it can\ncompete with global players. All policies of tariff reduction and\nlifting of quantitative restrictions will be formulated taking the\nabove facts into accounts, but the objective will be to protect the\nnational economy and national interest like all nations do and not\nto indulge in economic isolationism.\n\nStudy and Appraise the Impact of Reforms on the Economy\n\nTHE process of liberalization and economic reforms needs to\nbe properly strategized from the standpoint of broader national\ninterest and rationally phased in. In doing so, the experience of\nthe Asian nations presently under pressure will also have to be\ntaken into account. As we approach the 21st century, we need to\ninstitute studies and appraise and review the reforms process and\nalso the proposed reforms and redefine the broad contours of the\nnational strategy for the next ten years. Based on the appraisal,\nthe BJP Government will clearly define the contours and schedule\nof the liberalization and reforms. The procedural reforms like\nrectification of corporate law, tax law and other commercial laws will\nbe separated from policy formulation like the policy on insurance\nand pension funds.\n\nOur Medium-Term Agenda\n\nTHE broad national agenda of the BJP, containing an illustrative\nlist of important and priority items for preparing the nation for\nfuture challenges, is set out below:\n\nUntitled-10 160 11/7/2016 11:19:26 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 161\n\n1. India must adopt policies that will enable a sustained 8\nto 9 per cent annual rate of growth of GDP. This would\nmean an agricultural growth of at least 5 per cent a year\nand industrial growth of at least 12 per cent a year. Without\npowering agriculture in a big way, Indian growth rate\ncannot be sustained at higher levels. China, endowed\nwith much less cultivable land and resources, could\nachieve an average agricultural growth of 8 to 10 per cent\na year between 1983 to 1993 and doubled its agricultural\nproduction. India can and should achieve this and more.\nThe agricultural agenda should be designed accordingly.\nA separate agenda for the non-corporate sector, which\naccounts for 40 per cent of the GDP, should also be\npursued to achieve this target of sustained high growth.\nRecognizing the gross neglect of proper strategy in the past,\nour Government will focus on a judicious combination of\ninfrastructure and agriculture to achieve a high trajectory\nof growth.\n\n2. In the next five years, we must become a credible partner\nin Asia\u2019s development process and forge a relationship\non equal terms with the major economic powers of the\nworld \u2014USA, EU and Japan.\n\n3. In the next three years, our Government will strive to\nachieve strong macro-economic fundamentals; fiscal\nrectitude where, more than fiscal deficit, the revenue\ndeficit is controlled; strong and viable balance of payments;\nmonetary policy designed to resist unrealistic fall in\nrupee value; moderate inflation; and credit availability\nto industry.\n\nSome Important and Priority Items for the National Agenda\n\n1. The Government will formulate a system of voluntary\ncompliance with all direct and indirect tax obligations\nwith test-check assessments of select cases and expedite\nconviction of the defaulters.\n\n2. The Government will ensure a day-to-day working\nrelationship with Indian industry through a structured\nforum like the MITI in Japan.\n\n3. Even as the private sector will be encouraged to invest\n\nUntitled-10 161 11/7/2016 11:19:26 PM\n\f\n162 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nin infrastructure, the Government will also invest in\n\ninfrastructure. The private sector has not been a major\n\ncontributor in this area. Even in the developed world, the\n\nshare of the private sector in such development does not\n\nexceed 30 to 40 per cent. For this purpose, the Government\n\nwill:\n\n\u00a2 Access the long-term debt market in Insurance and\nPension Funds.\n\n\u00a2 Set up national-level regulatory bodies for different\nareas of infrastructure.\n\n\u00a2 Bring about more transparency, institute contracts\nwhich are easily enforceable and formulate laws that\nsimplify the procedures.\n\nIt will also:\n\n\u00a2 Cut non-productive expenditure;\n\n\u00a2 Disinvest in non-strategic PSUs;\n\n\u00a2 Control and rationalize subsidies and trim all except\nthose that benefit the weaker sections;\n\n\u00a2 Reduce the size of the Government; and,\n\n\u00a2 Simplify tax laws and widen the tax net.\n\n4. The Government will institute an effective anti-dumping\nmachinery to prevent dumping from abroad and to prevent\nunfair anti-dumping action against the country.\n\n5. The Government will ensure that a climate of competition\nis created in the insurance sector \u2014 if need be, by involving\nIndian private sector in the insurance business.\n\n6. The Government will rationalize the banking sector by\ncreating specialization in unit banking, retail banking and\ncommercial banking. This will be done by consolidation and\nmergers to create global-size banks and promote efficiency\nand profitability to strengthen the Indian banking system.\n\nResource Generation: Fiscal Policy and the Promotion of Savings\n\nAll the above tasks will need large-scale resource mobilization.\nThis will not only call for the widening of the tax base but also\nsupplementing it with non-tax revenues. The BJP Government shall\ninnovate such resource augmentation through motivated savings.\nThe fiscal policy will aim to prevent the generation of black money.\nTax on services will be reviewed.\n\nUntitled-10 162 11/7/2016 11:19:26 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 163\n\nWe will structure a fiscal policy that will help generate a\nhigher level of savings. We will aim to increase the savings rate\nto 30 per cent in the next five years. Acceleration of savings will\nrequire the elimination of dissavings, which, in its wake, will\nprune the size of Government and the public sector and generate\nthe much-needed resources for attending to the highly neglected\nareas of social infrastructure like education and public health.\nLike physical infrastructure, social infrastructure will be a priority\non the agenda of the BJP Government. In their abortive zeal for\ncontaining the fiscal deficit, previous Governments have cut plan\nexpenditure drastically and, instead, increased revenue expenditure\nin unpruned regulatory arms of Government which have outlived\ntheir utility in the era of liberalization. This trend will be reversed\nand it is expected that the reactivation of public expenditure will\npull the economy out of demand stagnation and recession. It should\nbe recognized that the halt in public investment in infrastructure,\nboth physical and social, in the fond hope that did not materialize,\nof the private sector making good the gap, has caused undue harm\nto the economy.\n\nEradication of Poverty Through Generation of Jobs\n\nTHE above strategy is also firmly rooted in the recognition\nthat growth cannot be sustained in the backdrop of accentuation in\npoverty and human misery. Poverty cannot also be wished away\nthrough an abstract definition built on calorific value. A meaningful\nestimation of poverty will now be structured on the matrix of factors\nthat dilute the quality of life such as illiteracy, lack of sustained\nemployment, malnutrition, lack of shelter, safe drinking water,\nsanitation and health care. The lot of the poor, thus defined, will\nbe improved through a multi-pronged approach, with the focus\non increased employment opportunities. The BJP Government will\nmake the Ninth Plan itself an employment-focused Plan.\n\nThe development strategy followed in the last fifty years\nseparates development from employment, treating human\nbeings as fodder in the process of development. Employment has\nonly received lip service in the economic plans; in effect it has\nreceived a very low priority. Employment has been treated as a\nby-product and not the main goal of development. It has been\nmore so since 1991 under the half-baked reform philosophy. The\n\nUntitled-10 163 11/7/2016 11:19:26 PM\n\f\n164 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nall-West model of the reforms generates only jobless growth. The\nBJP believes that it is only through full employment \u2014 not just any\nkind of employment, but gainful and productive employment \u2014\nthat rapid and sustainable development is possible. It is through\nemployment that the real purpose of development, namely, the\nraising of the living standards and dignity of the people, can be\nrealized.\n\nItis distressing tonote that unemploymentand underemployment\nand, consequently, poverty-prevails in our country on sucha massive\nscale. Even when the GDP growth rates have increased, employment\ngrowth rates have declined in agriculture as well as in industry. The\nprevailing employment growth rate is less than half of the rate at\nwhich addition to the labour force takes place. The BJP will review\nthe Ninth Plan in all its aspects, with the objective of installing\nemployment as its centrepiece. In the next ten years, over 10 crore\npeople will be provided jobs, besides ameliorating the extensive\nunderemployment and concealed unemployment. Our strategy will\nconsist of the following:\n\n1. A substantially higher growth rate of GDP of 8 to 9 per\n\ncent;\n\n2. Emphasis on sectors which offer large potential for\nemployment, including small-scale, artisan-based and\nrural industries, infrastructure, housing (urban and rural),\nconstruction, agriculture, wasteland development and\nforestry and labour-intensive production;\n\n3. Opting for projects and technologies, wherever choices\nexist, without reducing productivity, that offer larger\nemployment;\n\n4. Increasing productivity in the informal sector through the\nsupport of technology, credit and marketing;\n\n5. Redesigning the special employment programmes \u2014\nIntegrated Rural Development Programme, Jawahar Rozgar\nYojana, Nehru Rozgar Yojana, Scheme for self-employment\nof the Educated Youth, etc.\u2014to increase their coverage\nand effectiveness;\n\n6. Encouraging the employment of women;\n\n7. Fully involving the private sector and non-governmental\norganizations;\n\n8. Adopting the institutional approach of cooperatives,\n\nUntitled-10 164 11/7/2016 11:19:27 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 165\n\nwherever possible;\n9. Implementing the special employment programmes through\npanchayat institutions; and,\n10. Vocational training.\n\nOur Commitment: Removal of Hunger and Ensuring Food for All\n\nIN this fiftieth year of Indian independence, we commit\nourselves to freeing India of the scourge of hunger. The Indian\nsocial traditions abhor hunger and had instituted different\nsocial, religious and cultural mechanisms to eliminate hunger.\nThe tradition which acted as a social security against hunger\nweakened with the advent of colonialism and it never revived\nafter we attained freedom. The result is that hunger has become\npart of Indian social life. We have to and we shall, ensure that\nin this land, no one is obliged to sleep on a hungry stomach.\nFor this purpose, we shall explore and encourage all possible\nways, both Governmental and societal, of ensuring food for all.\nAs a concomitant of food for all, we shall recast the agricultural\npolicy of the country to increase food production so that India\nonce again becomes the land of abundance in food in next five\nyears.\n\nPublic Sector Reforms\n\nCUTTING down of dissavings will be possible only by pruning\nthe public sector and confining it to sensitive areas where the\nnation\u2019s physical or economic security is involved and to residual\nareas where the presence of public sector is necessary for providing\na moderating or counterpoising role to the ill effects, if any, of\nan unchecked private sector. The minimal public sector will be\nmanaged professionally, with least interference by Government.\nWhile pruning the public sector, it will be ensured that the interests\nof workers are duly taken care of. Greater emphasis will be placed\non retraining and redeployment aspects of the National Renewal\nFund rather than confining its scope to retrenchment.\n\nRole of Foreign Direct Investment\n\nIt is needless to add that national development will be largely\nfunded by capital generated within the country and foreign\ninvestment will play only a small role. The percentage of FDI to\n\nUntitled-10 165 11/7/2016 11:19:27 PM\n\f\n166 * Party Document Vol-1\n\ntotal investment in India during the years 1991-96 is less than 2\nper cent and confirms that even in the post-reform period, national\ndevelopment has been almost entirely financed by local capital.\nHowever, in areas like infrastructure (particularly energy, roads\nand ports), promotion of exports and high-technology industries,\nFDI can usefully supplement national efforts. Policies will be\nframed consistent with national interest in respect of FDI. The BJP\nGovernment will ensure that FDI flows into such priority areas and\nnot in areas where the domestic industry is functioning well. The\nBJP Government will frame policies to restrict FDI in non-priority\nareas. FDI will be encouraged to promote exports rather than target\nthe domestic market. FDI is welcome in a non-predatory role in\njoint ventures rather than in 100 per cent subsidiaries. Generally,\nthe role of foreign capital should be in harmony with and advance,\nthe nation\u2019s economic objectives, as also in line with other Asian\ncountries. Again, until the Indian economy reaches a level of\nglobal strength, takeovers of existing Indian companies by foreign\ncompanies will not be encouraged and suitable, transparent rules\nwill be framed to give effect to this policy. Even developed nations\nlike France, Germany and Switzerland have restrictions on the\ntakeover of domestic companies.\n\nNational Agenda for Bhagidari Sector (Un-incorporated Sector)\n\nAn analysis of India\u2019s GDP shows that agricultural accounts for\n27 per cent; corporate sector 12 per cent; and the Government sector\n21 per cent; all adding up to 60 per cent. The balance 40 per cent\nof the GDP comes from the largest segment of our economy \u2014 the\nunincorporated sector (partnership/ proprietorship firms) which\nbore the brunt of the license-permit quota raj at the cutting edge\nof its interaction with the organs of State power. Millions of un-\nincorporated enterprises in the country contributing 40 per cent\nof our national income did not deserve even a small paragraph in\nour Economic Surveys and Reserve Bank reports.\n\nThis most important segment has so far commanded the least\nattention and virtually no legitimacy. The entire establishment\nignored these unincorporated enterprises which have a share of\nnearly 50 per cent of national income in the manufacturing sector,\na share of 60 per cent in the construction sector, a share of more\nthan 75 per cent in the transport sector, nearly 90 per cent in the\ntrade sector, more than 80 per cent in hotels and restaurants and\n\nUntitled-10 166 11/7/2016 11:19:27 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 167\n\nnearly 100 per cent in the business and other services like that of a\ndoctor, lawyer, accountant, goldsmith, plumber, porter, mechanic,\nelectrician, tailor, barber, carpenter, driver, priest, cook, musician\nand in the crafts and professions. We neglected this sector (which\nis clubbed as part of households in our savings statistics) which\nconstitute the largest segment of savers contributing around 60 per\ncent of our national savings. During 1990-96 out of the total gross\ndomestic savings of Rs. 11,32,029 crore, the savings by household\nsector was Rs. 8,94,918 crore, i.e. nearly 80 per cent and the Bhagidari\nsector is the largest segment of the household sector other than\nthe salary earners.\n\nAny agenda for reform necessarily has to focus its attention on\nthe largest segment of our economy which was also the least cared\nfor during the inspector-raj nurtured by the socialistic regime. But\nthe so-called reforms of the nineties did not address the serious\nissues of using the phenomenal and enormous savings rate of our\nmiddle-class.\n\nThe focus of the Government in the nineties, in the name\nof reforms, concentrated essentially on the corporate sector and\nforeign investment that came a cropper. A clear understanding and\na broad national agenda, with the following measures, are needed\nfor the Bhagidari sector.\n\n(a) The financing cost for this sector is phenomenal and they\nborrow at usurious interest rates. There is no exclusive,\nnational-level financing agency for trade activities or\nfor construction activities. Indian private-sector banks\nneed to be encouraged and developed in these areas and\nthe Government policies should facilitate the same. A\nseparate development bank for this sector will also be\nconsidered.\n\n(b) There is no social security net for this sector. With changing\npatterns in the joint family system, there is even more\nnecessity to introduce the same. The Indian private sector\ninsurance companies can provide this. Unless and until the\nsocial security net is developed for this sector (of course,\nfrom the contributions of this sector), economic reforms\nwill be a castle built on American sands and the European\nair, but not on Indian soil.\n\n(c) In order to mobilize savings of this sectors for targeted\n\nUntitled-10 167 11/7/2016 11:19:27 PM\n\f\n168 * Party Document Vol-1\n\npoverty alleviation programmes, it would be desirable that\nfull deduction is given for the traditional commitments of\nthe sector, including family obligation and contribution of\nthis sector for temples, mosque, gurudwaras, etc. where\nfree food is provided to poor people daily. This would\nreduce the leakages in the anti-poverty schemes currently\nundertaken, since this method would directly deal with\nthe target groups. Local citizens committee can monitor\nthis. The fear of God is a more powerful authority than\nthat of the Government in a country like India.\n\n(d) This sector is a target for all levels of the State machinery\nlike politicians, policemen, tax officials and municipal\nauthorities. A national-level awareness programme of this\nsector\u2019s contribution and a national-level law to guard\nthem against State excesses should also be formulated.\n\nThis sector has the greatest potentiality to grow with a\n\nquantum jump if this agenda is implemented. Any attempt to\nincrease employment and to eradicate unemployment must begin\nhere. This sector at once provides self-employment and multiplies\nemployment. This single sector has the greatest potentiality to\nattack unemployment, poverty and hunger.\n\nRole of Non-Banking Finance Companies\n\nTHE BJP realizes that savings, banking and finance is in\nthe Indian blood. There are tens of thousands of private finance\ninstitutions - nidhis, chits and other native methods of augmenting\nfinance and also modern-day non-banking finance institutions. The\nBJP views this sector as a potentially important one. The policy on\nNBFCs has been ad-hoc and they have been dealt with, at times,\nin a reckless manner. The new RBI guidelines preventing NBFCs\nfrom accepting deposits without rating is absurd, as we have not\neven developed standards for rating under Indian conditions. The\nBJP will review the entire regulation on the NBFCs and bring about\nan orderly growth and not planned destruction of this important\nsegment. This sector alone finances most of the transportation\nbusiness and the non-corporate sector, which is the most important\nand the largest sector of the national economy.\n\nUntitled-10 168 11/7/2016 11:19:28 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 169\n\nIndustrial Policy Reform\n\nTHE immediate task of the new Government will have to\nbe to create conditions for industry to regain its lost momentum.\nPersistence of the present conditions will cause irreparable damage\nto the fabric of Indian industry. The BJP recognizes the need for\ncorrective action on a war footing. We attach particular importance\nto the interdependence of industry and agriculture. We will improve\ninter-sectoral terms of trade and other linkages so that benefits\naccrue to both. The BJP also reiterates the importance of the small-\nscale and cottage industry sectors, in view of their contribution\nto employment, wider participation and new entrepreneurship.\nThese sectors, which have suffered neglect by the Congress and\nthe United Front Governments, will be given all encouragement\nand support by the BJP.\n\nThe permit-quota raj created conflicts between large and\nsmall industries. The BJP will strive to make small-scale units and\nlarge units, particularly where the former is the supplier of the\nlatter, into a structured ally like in Japan and Korea. The BJP will\nformulate policies for large units to invest up to 25 per cent in the\ncapital of the small unit so that the small unit has the backing of\nthe large unit for purposes of availing bank loans or other credit.\nBy such a relationship, hundreds of small units can coalesce with\na large-scale unit and benefit in a variety of ways.\n\nIn order to achieve the above objective, the BJP will:\n\n1. Further simplify industrial approvals and remove the\nplethora of restrictive controls that now exist. The Industrial\nDevelopment and Regulation Act will be replaced by an\nIndustrial Development Act. The role of the Government\nwill change from the restrictive, as it has been so far, to one\nof extending support and encouragement;\n\n2. Encourage research and development in enterprises as\nwell as in specialized institutions;\n\n3. Permit hazardous industries only in specified areas. Separate\nsatellite industrial parks will be set up exclusively for such\nunits;\n\n4. Give all encouragement and support to the small-scale and\ncottage industry sectors. Agencies will be established to\ngive them help in getting scarce raw materials, technology\nupgradation and marketing of their products. Flow of credit\n\nUntitled-10 169 11/7/2016 11:19:28 PM\n\f\n170 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nto these sectors will be enhanced. We will reconsider the\nAbid Hussain Committee recommendations on SSI units in\nthe light of the difficulties and apprehensions of SSI. The\ninvestment limit of Rs. 3 crore will also be reviewed if any\nmisuse of the higher limit is found. The tiny sector will be\nrelieved of labour laws and other legislations by which they\nare subject to harassment; and,\n\n5. Ensure a healthy capital market with the twin objectives\nof increasing capital investment in the corporate sector\nand of providing protection to the investing public.\n\nMaking Labour a Proud Partner in the Nation\u2019s Progress\nOUR plan to reform the reform process through the Swadeshi\napproach, includes:\n\n1. Astrong commitment to make labour, both organized and\nunorganized, an equal and proud partner in the nation\u2019s\nprogress;\n\n2. Rationalize and simplify labour laws.\n\nRecognize trade unions on the basis of secret ballot.\n\n4. Introduce worker-participation from the shopfloor to the\nboardroom.\n\n5. Strengthen institutional mechanisms to ensure speedy,\njust and corruption-free redressal of labour grievances.\n\n\u00bb\n\nPolicy on Tourism\n\nTHE BJP recognizes the importance of tourism as a generator\n\nof jobs and foreign exchange. Its Government will:\n\n1. Promote tourism as a way to have a more meaningful and\nwider understanding of India and its people.\n\n2. Evolve a national policy for tourism to provide needed\ninfrastructure such as hotels, transports and removal of\nbureaucratic impediments.\n\n3. Create a regulatory mechanism to avoid long-term damage\nto the heritage and the environment.\n\n4. Take care of the pilgrimage component of tourism by\nensuring the cleanliness, basic facilities, etc. at pilgrimage\ncentres of all sects.\n\n5. Shift the exclusive emphasis from five-star tourism to\ntourism for the masses.\n\nUntitled-10 170 11/7/2016 11:19:28 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 171\n\n6. Enable India to have its rightful share in the growing global\ntourism industry, while ensuring that Indian culture,\nheritage and values are preserved and projected.\n\nPolicy on Infrastructure\n\nSINCE infrastructure constitutes a critical aspect of the national\neconomy, an overview of the BJP\u2019s thinking on infrastructure is\npresented under:\n\nPolicy on Energy and Power\n\nINVESTMENT in power must be accelerated urgently. Any\nfurther delay in adding new capacity will inflict considerable costs\non the economy.\n\n1. In power generation, most of the private sector investments\nhave got bogged down in never-ending negotiations. The\nGovernment will ensure that all eight \u2018fast track\u2019 projects\nstart construction in 1998.\n\n2. Transmission and distribution need to be strengthened.\nAfter appropriate study, a National and/or Regional\nPower Trading Corporation may be set up for efficient\nuse of the generated power. Power Grid Corporation\u2019s\nplans to implement a national grid will be speeded up. To\nensure that private investors in this sub-sector do not have\nthe same experience as their counterparts in generation,\nthe Government will create a standardized application\nprocedure with clear and transparent rules for their entry;\n\n3. The Government will strive for a national consensus to\nensure that, in five years, a commercially viable power\ntariff structure comes into operation;\n\n4. BHEL will be revitalized to expand its capacity to emerge\nas a global player in the next five years;\n\n5. The Government will review the liquid fuel policy and\ninstitute a more efficient and fair policy regime;\n\n6. To encourage non-conventional sources of energy, the\nMinistry of Non-conventional Energy Sources and IREDA\nwill be strengthened. Large-scale research and development\nwill be instituted to develop more non-conventional energy;\n\n7. Other things being equal, preference will be given to Indian\ncompanies in power generation and distribution;\n\nUntitled-10 171 11/7/2016 11:19:28 PM\n\f\n172 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n8. The long-stalled nuclear power programme will be restarted.\nIndia has mastered the technology and the entire nuclear fuel\ncycle. There is no reason why only two nuclear plants have\ngone critical in the last seven years. Instead of importing\nnuclear power technology from Russia, there is no reason\nwhy our trained engineers should not be exporting Indian\nnuclear power technology to foreign countries;\n\n9. In the oil sector, the Government will involve the Indian\nprivate sector in oil extraction and refining on the explored\noil fields and will, on viable terms, allow Indian joint\nventures with foreign companies in oil exploration and\nextraction; and,\n\n10. In the coal sector, the Government will increase the\nproduction of coal, reduce costs and raise productivity.\nIt will involve the Indian private sector in coal mining so\nas to meet the increased energy needs of the country.\n\nRailways\nTRANSPORT must become multi-modal to meet the needs of\ndevelopment. The most important type of transport is the Indian\nRailways. The rate of growth of the Railways has come down. A\ncomplete review of the working of the Indian Railways would have\nto be undertaken along with a study of the use of roads in the areas\nserved by the Railways. There are thousands of kilometers of rail\ntrack lying unused, while the roads alongside those very tracks\nare overburdened with traffic, despite Railways being cheaper.\n1. Private participation in using such idle railway tracks will\nbe allowed;\n2. An efficiency audit of the Railways will have to be done\nto prevent wastage and disuse of stores and rolling stock;\n3. Also, a study should be done to ensure that trains carry\npayloads up to 4,000 tonnes;\n4. We will institute research and development for the Indian\nRailways suited to Indian conditions.;\n5. Container transport will be encouraged on a point-to-point\nbasis; and,\n6. The Railways will also run pilgrimage specials connecting\nthe several places of pilgrimage in the country both from\na commercial point of view and service to the pilgrims,\n\nUntitled-10. 172 11/7/2016 11:19:28 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 173\n\nas well as from the standpoint of national integration.\n\nRoads and Bridges\n\nINADEQUATE road networks have led to higher transportation\ncosts that have also eroded the international competitiveness of the\nIndian economy. Trucks in India travel only 200-250 kilometers a\nday, compared to 500-600 kilometers a day in developed countries.\nTherefore, proper road construction will lead to a big increase in\ntransport efficiency. For this purpose, the BJP will do the following\nthings:\n\n1. The National Highways Authority of India will be made\nthe regulator for this sector. It will be responsible for setting\ntolls, inviting bids from private companies, evaluating\nthem and awarding them. The BJP will continue with the\ncurrent fiscal incentives for this sector. Like in other sectors,\nit will identify the non-fiscal barriers to investment in this\nsector, for their speedy removal;\n\n2. The Government will identify the four most heavily used\nstretches of the national highway system. It will formulate\nand implement an action plan to upgrade them within two\nyears using both the public and private sectors wherever\nnecessary. It is important that these critical bottlenecks be\nremoved as soon as possible;\n\n3. For all other highways, the Government will invite the\nprivate sector to upgrade them, for which they will collect\ntoll revenues. If the private sector is not interested, the\nGovernment will create a State-owned National Highway\nDevelopment Corporation that will go ahead and upgrade\nthese highways, for which it will also levy tolls;\n\n4. A proportion of the taxes on motor vehicles and on petrol\nand diesel collected in each city will be handed over to that\ncity or town to use to upgrade the roads in those cities;\nand,\n\n5. Except for very long distance and high investment projects,\nthe policy will be to involve only the Indian private sector\nin the bids.\n\nUntitled-10 173 11/7/2016 11:19:29 PM\n\f\n174 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nInland Waterways\n\nTHERE is an enormous potential for inland waterways in\nIndia. The estimated length of waterways available is over 30,000\nkilometers and they touch almost all the important centres in our\ncountry. The cost of water transport is a third of the cost of surface\ntransport. Waterways were once considered to be better for India\nthan other forms of transport in many areas. The development of\nwaterways will also lead to the proper maintenance of reservoirs\nand canals, since revenue would be generated from water transport.\nThe BJP will develop a blueprint for water transport and allow\nprivate parties to get into inland water transport.\n\nSea Ports\n\nMOST Indian ports are operating at more than 100 per cent\ncapacity. Yet they are very inefficient when compared to other parts\nin the region. As part of a proper ports development programme,\nthe BJP will do the following things:\n\n1. Convert ports into companies that can raise funds from\nthe debt and equity markets. The initial shareholding of\nthis company can be divided four ways with the central\nGovernment, the State Government, the city administration\nand the general public;\n\n2. Ports will be encouraged to invest in the latest information\ntechnology and cargo handling equipment to reduce\nturnaround time;\n\n3. The workers of ports should be retrained to use these new\ntechnologies. Ports must be more efficient, but they need\nto become so without displacing too many workers;\n\n4. Develop Mumbai and Vishakhapatnam ports as megaports,\nwhich will be warehouses for the country on either\nseaboard;\n\n5. Private sector minor ports should be encouraged. They\nwill take the load of the bigger ports; and\n\n6. Except for large international ports, in other cases,\npreference will be given to Indian companies.\n\nCoastal Shipping\n\nINDIA has a long coastline and its peninsular formation is\nideally suited for development of coastal shipping. Considering\n\nUntitled-10 174 11/7/2016 11:19:29 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 175\n\nthat coastal shipping is cheaper than surface transport and further\nconsidering that nearly 30 per cent of the cargo carried by Indian\nRailways is coal, coastal shipping can relieve the surface transport\nsector of a big burden. Indian private sector will be involved in\ncoastal shipping development. Cheaper movement of coal by\ncoastal shipping will also enable thermal power generation along\nthe coastline to transmit power inland.\n\nTelecommunications\nThe aim of our telecom policy will be to:\n\n1. Increase the number of phone lines dramatically, especially\nin villages; and,\n\n2. Satisfy the more demanding audio, video and data\ncommunications needs of business and homes.\n\nFor these purposes, the BJP Government will take the following\nsteps:\n\n1. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 will be replaced with new\nlegislation that takes into account the advances in the last\ncentury and more and reflects the current and future status\nof the telecom sector;\n\n2. The Government's role will be that of a regulator, so the\nTelecom Regulatory Authority of India will be strengthened;\n\n3. The department of telecom will be converted into a\ncompany called India Telecom. To expedite the shift from\na Government department to a profit-making company,\nthe Government will divest a portion of its shareholdings\nin India Telecom at the appropriate time;\n\n4. The Government will not discriminate between Government-\nowned companies or the new private companies coming\ninto operation. All restrictions (inter-circle, long-distance,\ninternational) will be removed on schedule, or earlier, in\nthe interests of greater competition;\n\n5. However, the Government will maximize the returns from\nthe companies that it already owns (India Telecom, VSNL,\nMINL, ITI). To make these telecom companies competitive,\nthey need to have the freedom to hire the best people and\npay them market salaries. These companies will be given\nthis freedom;\n\n6. Since India is expected to have the sixth-largest number\n\nUntitled-10 175 11/7/2016 11:19:29 PM\n\f\n176 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nof phones in the world in the next few years, it must have\na telecom-manufacturing industry to match this. The\nGovernment will encourage the creation of world-class\ntelecom-manufacturing in India, that is encouraged to use\nindigenously developed technology; and,\n\n7. The Government policy for foreign direct investment will\ndiscourage foreign majority holdings in telecommunication\ncompanies.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s Approach to the WTO\n\n1. The major task facing our country in the economic sphere\nis the preservation of a measure of autonomy in the\nmanagement of the national economy, which the Congress\nGovernment surrendered meekly by accepting without\nresistance the highly prejudicial WTO conditionalities. The\nGovernment should have the sovereign and inalienable\nright to choose its economic system as well as its legal,\nsocial, cultural and political system in accordance with its\nhistoric traditions, national genius and the express will\nof its people. This would be the foremost objective of our\nparty to restore the desired autonomy.\n\n2. Agriculture, which concerns the bulk of our people and,\nin particular, WTO issues connected with subsidies,\nfertilizers and seeds so that the interests of the farmer and\nconsumer of food are not sacrificed would be adequately\nexamined. No legislations concerning agriculture and\ncommitments under the Uruguay Round would be allowed\nto be implemented without full democratic discussion.\n\n3. The small-scale sector, which is the backbone of our\neconomy and employment would not be exposed to\nunequal competition, both from large houses in the country\nand from the transnational corporations from abroad. The\nsmall-scale sector would be strengthened.\n\n4. The agreement on services, particularly financial services,\nwould be monitored in respect of the entry of powerful\nforeign interests in our country. The immigration laws\nabroad should also not confuse rights of the developed\ncountries for effective opportunities for our people in those\ncountries.\n\nUntitled-10 176 11/7/2016 11:19:29 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 177\n\n5. The patent system, in particular, would not be allowed\nto become an import monopoly and working of a patent\nand dissemination of technology would be ensured by\nan effective and strong \u2018license of right\u2019 and \u2018compulsory\nlicense\u2019 regime.\n\n6. The BJP would strive to work out a strategy and consensus\nwithin the nation and with all nations similarly placed\nto lobby for legitimately justified modification of the\nperspective, programmes, rules and schedule of the WTO.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 177 11/7/2016 11:19:29 PM\n\f\nSocial Infrastructure\nA Better Standard of Living is Every Indian\u2019s Birthright\n\nDESPITE various programmes launched at various points of time\nand although food production has touched 195 million tonnes from\na low of 50 million tonnes in 1951, India still loses 11 per cent of\nunder five children and 3 to 4 per cent women in the reproductive\nage group due to malnutrition. It is a reflection of the performance\nof previous Governments that 53 per cent of the country\u2019s children\naged under five are malnourished. India has an abysmal record of\n28 per cent low birth weight babies. Fifty per cent of the population\nsuffers from iron deficiency and 20 per cent of all maternal deaths\nare due to anemia. To wipe out these shameful figures, the BJP will:\n1. Ensure household food security commensurate with the\nnational food security so that all families in rural and\nurban areas get two square meals a day by the year 2003;\n2. Review and vigorously implement the National Nutrition\nPolicy and the Plan of Action on Nutrition so that all goals\nare achieved by their target dates;\n3. Revamp and expand the scope of Integrated Child\nDevelopment Services; and,\n4. Use the PDS effectively to help the poorest of the poor.\n\nHousing for All: A New Habitat Policy\n\nTHE BJP recognizes that soon one-third of India\u2019s population\nwill be living in urban centres. It is important to ensure planned\ndevelopment of these centres from small towns to the big cities\nand the large metropolises. Urban slums are rapidly developing\nand conditions in them deteriorating. Particularly important are\nthe problems of drinking water, sewage and waste disposal in\n\nUntitled-10 178 11/7/2016 11:19:29 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 179\n\nurban centres. There is a severe shortage of housing both in the\nurban and rural areas. For us, shelter is a basic human need that\nmust be met at all cost. Extensive housing schemes also generate\nemployment. Therefore, the BJP will:\n\n1. Evolvea National Housing and Habitat Policy in consultation\nwith State Governments and Urban Development\nAuthorities. The policy will aim at providing shelter to\nall by year 2010 and also facilitate the construction of 20\nlakh new houses each year;\n\n2. Review the provisions of the Urban Land Ceiling Act and\nensure that land and property prices do not escalate as\nthey have in the past;\n\n3. Promote affordable mass housing for low and middle-\nincome groups;\n\n4. Make available adequate credit to house-seekers on\nattractive terms;\n\n5. Take steps to make additional rented accommodation\navailable; and\n\n6. Launch special concessional schemes to provide rural poor\nwith adequate and affordable housing.\n\nHealth for All\nOUR goal will be \u2018Health for All\u2019 by 2003, but the poor and\ndisadvantaged will be a special responsibility. Health delivery is\nmost effective when decentralized to State, district and local levels,\nwith communities taking leadership and responsibility for health\nand development. In this context, our ancient and local wisdom is\nof greatest importance. Public health cannot be regarded as only a\nconsumer of resource. It is essential for the creation of a good society\nwith high productivity. It is an investment in human resources.\nTowards this end, we will strive for:\n1. Clean drinking water in all villages and slums;\n2. Attaining 100 per cent universal immunization of children\nagainst preventable diseases;\n3. Vigorously attacking eradicable diseases like yaws, leprosy\nand filariasis;\n4. Promoting awareness on cleanliness, sanitation and disease\nprevention;\n5. Emphasizing prevention of diseases and maintenance\n\nUntitled-10 179 11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM\n\f\n180 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nof health which has been the basis of Indian culture and\ncanalizing resources based on this philosophy;\n\n6. Promoting traditional and alternative systems of\nmedicine such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Homeopathy,\nNaturopathy, with particular emphasis on traditional\nwisdom and indigenous knowledge, with full quality\nassurance;\n\n7. Safeguarding traditional medical knowledge and natural\nresources;\n\n8. Spending more on pre-natal and post-natal health care\nprogrammes and thus drastically reducing India\u2019s infant\nmortality rate and under-five mortality rate;\n\n9. Launching an attack through existing programmes relating\nto AIDS, tuberculosis and vector borne diseases like\nmalaria, dengue haemorrhagic fever and kalaazar, with\nspecial attention to elimination of shortfalls/ deficiencies\nin implementation;\n\n10. Introducing health impact assessment in all development\nprojects;\n\n11. Ensuring that essential drugs are available at affordable\nprices;\n\n12. Introducing low-cost health insurance schemes;\n\n13. Providing concessional health care for the aged;\n\n14. Instituting a mechanism to monitor and collate health-\nrelated information and ensure timely intervention through\nsurveillance;\n\n15. Providing every panchayat with a free and truly functional\nbasic healthcare centre, particularly with facilities for\nmother and child care; as well as access to these centres;\n\n16. Making the screening of blood at blood banks mandatory\nand provide for punitive punishment for any violation;\nand,\n\n17. Making doctors, para-medical and non-medical staff at\nGovernment and private hospitals and healthcare centres\naccountable by suitable law.\n\nEducation for All\n\nIt is sad that fifty years after independence, the cherished\n\ngoal of universal primary education enshrined in the\n\nUntitled-10 180 11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 181\n\nConstitution, which was to have been implemented by 1960,\nyet remains to be achieved. In recent years, State support for\neducation has been wholly inadequate. Quality education is\nfast becoming the preserve of the social and economic elite of\nthe country. We hold that education is both a human right and\na means to bring about transformation to a dynamic, humane,\nthinking society. Towards this end, the BJP will:\n\n1. Increase State spending on education progressively to six\nper cent and more of our Gross National Product within\nfive years;\n\n2. Achieve near complete functional literacy in five years,\nparticularly by mobilizing societal participation and full\nliteracy by the year 2010.\n\n3. Launch a nationwide Educational Quality Improvement\nCampaign covering all institutions from primary schools\nto universities;\n\n4. Accord priority to free primary education and enroll the\nhelp of locally-funded non-government organizations\nin this area; also integrate early childhood care and pre-\nprimary education with primary education;\n\n5.

It\nis the mainstay of India\u2019s economy and culture. India is blessed with\nevery natural resource needed for sustaining a strong agricultural\neconomy. We have vast cultivable land, ample sources of water,\nforests and most importantly, year-long tropical sunlight. We have a\nlarge agricultural human resource that has inherited a rich and hoary\ntradition in farming. It has also acquired the tools of modern science\nand technology. The combination of these two resources could have\ntransformed Free India into a continental granary. But fifty years\nof neglect, corruption and wrong policies by successive Congress\nand quasi-Congress Governments have severely handicapped the\nIndian farmer and the entire rural economy. \u2018Villager is the salt of\nIndian earth,\u2019 said Mahatma Gandhi. \u2018Jai Kisan\u2019 said Lal Bahadur\nShastri. But in the last five decades, a majority of our kisans have\nbecome poor and harried outcasts in their own country, with no\nrespectful place in the Governments\u2019 scheme of things. Today\nthey are on the margins of India\u2019s economic, social, cultural and\npolitical life.\n\nRural India and Urban India Complement and Supplement Each\nOther\n\nTHE BJP is of the considered view that India will not become\na strong, prosperous and confident nation until and unless there\nis a qualitative improvement in our rural economy and the\ncondition of our kisans. In the absence of any comprehensive and\nenlightened agricultural policy, the Congress Governments made\n\nUntitled-10 183 11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM\n\f\n184 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nno attempt either to ensure remunerative prices for farmers based\non a scientific assessment of all the input costs or to bring about a\nrational balance between the prices of agricultural and industrial\nproducts. Institutional credit and marketing support for the Indian\nkisan was deliberately kept weak and unreliable. As a result, the\nhardworking Indian kisan was pushed into poverty and the vicious\nclutches of debt. Newspapers have reported about \u2018serial suicides\u2019\nby farmers in Andhra Pradesh. In 1950-51, the ratio between per\ncapita rural and urban income was 1:2. Today, it has become 1:4.\n\nThe BJP believes that the one-fourth urban India cannot have\nbalanced development without the rapid development of the\nthree-fourths rural India. Hence, rural India is not antagonistic,\nbut complementary and supplementary to urban India.\n\nBJP\u2019s Agenda for Reinvigorating Rural India\n\n\u00a2 The BJP attaches the highest priority to ensuring India\u2019s\nfood security and to the crying need to rid India of the\nscourge of hunger. Towards the goal of creating a hunger-\nfree society, our Government shall appeal to Indian kisans\nto double food production by the year 2010 and pledges\nall support for the realization of this objective.\n\n\u00a2 The BJP pledges to reverse the process of economic, social\nand political marginalization of India\u2019s rural population\nand effectively fight the elitist, anti-kisan Congress mindset,\nwhich engendered this process.\n\n\u00a2 The BJP is committed to restore agriculture to its proper\nplace in the national economy and re-establish, before the\nclose of the first decade of the next century, India\u2019s farmers\nas a strong and self-confident community enjoying the\nfruits of prosperity and social justice.\n\n\u00a2 We shall take all the necessary steps to vastly increase\nboth public and private investment in agriculture and\nagro-based industries, with the aim of harnessing its\nfull potential for rural wealth generation and productive\nemployment generation. In this, our priority will be the\nsmall and medium farmers and small-scale industries and\nbusinesses.\n\n\u00a2 Transfer of technology and development of appropriate\ntechnology has become a matter of great urgency\n\nUntitled-10 184 11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 185\n\nfor the revitalization of the rural economy. We shall\nsupport all initiatives to make agriculture knowledge-\nintensive, drawing on both ancient and modern farm\ntechniques.\n\nJai Kisan: Our Commitments to the Farm and Rural sector\nEarmark 60 per cent of Plan funds in the budget for\nagricultural and rural development.\n\nUntitled-10 185\n\n1.\n\nMake a quantum increase in Governmental and private\n\ninvestment in improving the rural infrastructure\n\nof irrigation, all-weather roads, transport, power,\ntelecommunication and credit and financing facilities.\nSubstantially increase Governmental and private investment\nin strengthening the social infrastructure in rural areas\nin the fields of drinking water, education, health-care,\nsanitation and housing.\n\nThrough a massive plan of rural housing, the goal of\n\u2018Shelter for All\u2019 will be achieved by the year 2010. At least\nhalf the task will be sought to be achieved in the next five\nyears.\n\n. Give all possible support to increasing milk production\n\nand animal husbandry. Priority will be given to setting\nup milk processing and milk product manufacturing units\n\nclose to the catchment area.\nTo make agriculture sustainable for even the smallest\nfarmer, the following initiatives will be taken:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n(c)\n\nRemunerative prices for the entire range of agriculture\nproduce by linking them to input costs. Towards this\nend, our Government will constitute an Agriculture\nCosts and Prices Commission. Two-thirds of its\nmembers will be agriculturists and farm experts.\nThe Commission will be an autonomous body and\nits recommendations will be mandatory. It will also\nrecommend ways of achieving a balance between the\nprices of agricultural produce and industrial goods\nand services.\n\nIn the interim, support price for farm produce to be\nlinked to the general price index.\n\nTo help the farmers through a number of governmental\n\n11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM\n\f\n186 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nand cooperative schemes to reduce per acre production\ncost.\n\n(d) To help the farmers through a number of governmental\nand cooperative schemes to increase per acre farm\nproductivity. Towards this end, attractive incentives\nwill be instituted for those who achieve exceptionally\nhigh standards of productivity.\n\n(e) To reduce the dependence on primary agriculture\nproduction by encouraging profitable ancillary\nactivities.\n\n(f) To begin a nationwide crop and animal husbandry\ninsurance scheme to cover all farmers.\n\n7. Allow free movement of foodgrains throughout the country.\n\n8. Unveil a comprehensive policy for bringing waste and\nbarren land into productive agriculture or agro-forestry\nuse. Private sector companies will be encouraged to invest\nin this activity, provided individual farmers and village\ncooperatives are given substantial share in the equity\nholding.\n\n9. Give anew thrust to social forestry, horticulture, vegetable\ngrowing, floriculture, sericulture, mushroom farming.\n\n10. Encourage inland fisheries, piggeries and bee-keeping.\n\n11. As part of acomprehensive National Agri-business Policy,\nhelp setting up of value-addition chains to link production,\npreservation, transportation, processing, packaging and\nmarketing. This policy envisions the participation of the\nindividual agriculturist not only as a primary producer\nand supplier, but as a shareholder who will benefit from\nprofits generated at every stage of the value chain.\n\n12. Vastly expand the network of warehouses and mandis\n(market yards). Our policy will make it mandatory for\nthe mandis to pay 80 per cent of the price as an interim\npayment at the time of delivery of the farmer\u2019s produce.\n\n13. Delicense the sugar industry and decontrol the price and\nmovement of molasses.\n\n14. Encourage co-generation of power, as also production of\na wide variety of sugar-based by-products at all the sugar\nmills in India.\n\n15. Continue subsidy on fertilizers.\n\nUntitled-10 186 11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 187\n\n16. Set up a vast network of easily reachable farmers\u2019 service\ncentres and expand the scope of extension programmes.\n\n17. Make comprehensive documents available to farmers\ngiving land records, ownership and all other relevant\ninformation. Our Government will also promote rapid\ncomputerization of these records.\n\n18. Reform land acquisition laws with the following objectives:\n(a) Farmers should get prompt and full compensation for\nhis land at market rates; (b) Farmers who have to part\nwith their land for industrial or urbanization projects\nshould also be made shareholders in these projects; and\n(c) If any public or private sector agency which acquires\nfarm land for a particular project fails to execute it within\na specified period, the Government will take it back from\nthe promoters.\n\n19. Boost export of agriculture goods, especially processed\ngoods, in a big way. Imports will be kept to the bare\nminimum and that too if warranted by extraordinary\ncircumstances. In both export and import of farm goods,\nthe interests of Indian kisans will be given the highest\nconsideration.\n\n20. Bolster efforts to increase productivity in dryland farming.\n\n21. Re-orient agricultural planning on the basis of agro-\nclimatic zoning of the entire country to fully harness the\nnatural benefits of land fertility and ecosystems for specific\nagricultural produce.\n\nOur Steps to Provide Irrigation Facilities\n\n1. Double the area under irrigation in ten years through\noptimal use of small, medium and large projects. Priority\nwill be given to small and minor irrigation projects with\nlocal investment and management participation.\n\n2. Complete ongoing irrigation projects within a specified\nperiod and launch new projects ona firm, time-bound basis.\n\n3. Encourage the use of alternative sources of irrigation\nthrough incentives and better water management.\n\n4. Give attractive incentives for the popularization of drip\nirrigation and sprinkler irrigation systems.\n\n5. Ensure that farmers are made to pay only for the water\n\nUntitled-10 187 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM\n\f\n188 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nthey consume.\n\n6. Draw up a master plan for flood control and harnessing\nof flood waters for irrigation. Offer prompt compensation\nfor crops lost in floods.\n\n7. Take effective steps to raise the ground water level.\n\nCheck waterlogging, salination and soil erosion.\n\n9. Institute a Regional Water Corporation to plan and increase\nwater supplies.\n\n%\n\nOur Steps to Revive Village Industry\n1. Establish an extensive chain of small-scale, tiny and cottage\nindustry units.\n2. Give the greatest impetus to this sector by provision of\neasy and adequate credit at low interest rates.\n3. Create new marketing opportunities and facilities for rural\nartisans and craftsmen.\nSet up a National Artisan Development Bank.\nSet up special institutes for skill upgradation.\nGive attractive incentives for bio-gas units.\nCreate weekly mandis in towns and cities in which\nvillagers and artisans can sell their products directly to\nurban consumers.\n\nND Oe\n\nOur Steps to Provide Power for Agriculture\n\n1. Accelerate total rural electrification so that no village is\nleft without power in the next five years.\n\n2. Ensure adequate and reliable supply of quality power for\nagricultural activity.\n\n3. Set up small power stations and sub-stations in rural areas\nfor supplying power exclusively to villages.\n\n4. The frequent breaking down of transformers and\ndistributors in rural areas causes havoc with agricultural\noperations. SEBs, though, don\u2019t have the money to replace\nthese assets. The Government will encourage farmers (and\nother users) to form cooperatives to install, maintain and\ncharge for these rural electrical equipment. Loans from the\nRural Electrification Corporation will be given for this.\n\nUntitled-10 188 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 189\n\nOur Steps to Strengthen the Rural Cooperative Movement\n\n1. To unveil a National Rural Cooperatives Policy which\nwill review the working of the cooperative sector so far,\nsimplify rules and regulations governing the functioning\nof cooperative societies and introduce necessary reforms\nto bring this sector in line with the reforms in the rest of\nthe national economy.\n\n2. The policy will also recommend measures to promote\nthe cooperative movement in States where it is weak and\nailing.\n\n3. Free cooperatives from political and bureaucratic\ninterference.\n\n4. Take effective steps to eliminate corruption and nepotism\nin cooperative bodies.\n\n5. Ensure that rural cooperatives are not only commercially\nviable but also promote equity and social justice.\n\n6. Make entry in passbooks mandatory for all money deposits.\n\n7. Only those entirely dependent on agriculture will be\nallowed to become members of farmers\u2019 cooperative\nsocieties.\n\n8. Ensure free, fair and timely elections to cooperative bodies.\n\n9. Encourage collaboration between the cooperative sector\nand the corporate sector in the areas of marketing,\nmanufacturing, technology transfer, mobilization of\ninvestible resources and exports. All necessary measures\nwill, however, be taken to ensure that the interests of small\nand medium farmers are not only protected but promoted\nby such collaborative ventures.\n\n10. The BJP will enact the long-pending Multi-State Cooperative\nAct.\n\n11. Multiple and often conflicting laws and agencies governing\ncooperative banks and other rural financial institutions\nwill be streamlined.\n\nOur Steps to Implement Land Reforms\n\n1. Enforce the implementation of land ceiling laws in all\nStates.\n\n2. Set up designated courts to quickly deal with all land\nceiling disputes and monitoring enforcement of verdicts.\n\n3. Expedite distribution of ceiling surplus land among landless\n\nUntitled-10 189 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM\n\f\n190 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nfarmers.\n\n4. Monitor the use of the distributed land to prevent its\nalienation from beneficiaries.\n\n5. Reclaim cultivable land lying fallow.\n\n. Time-bound registration of all lands.\n\n7. Decide ownership rights at the level of Gram Panchayats\nwithout any delay.\n\na\n\nOur Steps to Improve Rural Education\n\n1. Re-orient education in villages and rural towns to address\nthe varied needs of agriculture, agro-processing, agri-\nservices, management and other areas of the rural economy.\nAgriculture and related subjects will be specially included\nin the curriculum in rural schools.\n\n2. Give a big boost to technical and vocational education as\nit is crucial to the development of rural human resources.\n\n3. Set up a chain of Krishi Vidyalayas in each block to enrich\nthe knowledge content and expertise of young people who\nare engaged in farming and farm-related activities.\n\n4. Increase facilities for informal farm education, short-\nterm courses, seminars, field trips, etc. for the benefit of\npracticing agriculturists.\n\n5. Give a major boost to rural R&D by strengthening the link\nbetween agricultural universities and top achievers in the\nfarming community.\n\nOur Steps to Ensure Cow Protection\n\nTHE BJP regretfully observes that, despite Article 48 of the\nConstitution, millions of cows and cow progeny are slaughtered\nevery year, most of them for export, thereby causing irreparable\nharm to agriculture and villages. Keeping in view Article 48, the\nBJP will:\n\n1. Impose a total ban on the slaughter of cows and cow-\nprogeny, including bulls and bullocks and prohibit all\ntrade, including export (state as well as private) in beef.\n\n2. Create a policy that will result in improved cattle breeding.\n\n3. Exempt the income of Goshalas and Pinjrapoles from tax.\n\nThe BJP recognizes the fact that from times immemorial,\n\ncow-protection has remained at the basics of Indian culture and\n\nUntitled-10 190 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 191\n\nIndian agriculture and it is on the patient back of the cow and its\nprogeny that the entire structure of Indian agriculture rests. Over\nseven crore animals are employed in farming operations in Indian\nvillages, more than 80 per cent of the rural transport needs are met\nby the bullock cart. Our livestock is also an effective protection\nagainst environmental degradation.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 191 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM\n\f\nOur Foreign Policy\n\nProtecting India\u2019s National Interest\n\nTHE end of the Cold War has brought with it hopes of an era of\npeace and harmony. We see many welcome new manifestations in\nour collective attitudes towards resolving longstanding international\nissues of common concern relating to the environment, health,\neconomic development and conflict resolution.\n\nWhile the possibilities are immense, some old habits persist.\nWe see a renewed tendency by some big powers to dominate and\nto impose conditionalities to advance their political and economic\ninterest even if it is detrimental to others. There are also perceived\nnotions of civilizational conflicts as also spurts in conflicts. This\ndemands that India\u2019s national interest must be protected and\npursued more vigorously. Our diplomacy must, therefore, be\nproactive rather than being merely reactive without sacrificing the\nvalues of peace, equality and cooperation.\n\nIn the recent past we have seen a tendency to bend under\npressure. This arises as much out of ignorance of our rightful\nplace and role in world affairs as also from a loss of national self-\nconfidence and resolve. A nation as large and capable as ourselves\nmust make its impact felt on the world arena. A BJP Government\nwill demand a premier position for the country in all global fora.\n\nThe BJP rejects the notion of nuclear apartheid and will actively\noppose attempts to impose a hegemonistic nuclear regime by\nmeans of CTBT, FMCR and MTCR. We will not be dictated to by\nanybody in matters of security requirements and in the exercise of\nthe nuclear option. We will pursue our national goals and principles\nsteadfastly. Briefly these are:\n\n1. To give India a role and position in world affairs\n\nUntitled-10 192 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 193\n\ncommensurate with its size and capability;\n\n2. To promote sovereign equality among nations. The BJP\nrejects all forms of political and economic hegemonism\nand is committed to actively resisting such efforts;\n\n3. To vigorously pursue endeavors for India to become a\npermanent member of the United Nations Security Council.\nWe believe that the existing arrangements in the UN are\ntilted in the favor of certain countries to serve their narrow\ninterest. We are committed to the reform of the UN;\n\n4. To re-orient Indian diplomacy to our economic and\ncommercial goals and to ensure that our missions abroad\nplay a more active and supportive role in meeting these;\n\n5. To ensure greater coordination between the ministries\nand agencies responsible for external affairs, defence,\nfinance, international trade and our external and internal\nintelligence;\n\n6. To promote greater regional and civilizational relationship\nand strive for Asian solidarity in general and the\ndevelopment of the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation in particular. Integral to this would be\nrenewed efforts to improve bilateral relationships with all\nneighboring countries without any third party mediation\nor interference;\n\n7. To have greater interaction with more African nations\nand to build ties with our traditional friends like Kenya,\nNigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe;\n\n8. To place relations with the USA ona more even platform\nbased on mutual respect, shared values and congruence of\ninterests. We expect the United States to be more sensitive\nto India\u2019s security and economic interests;\n\n9. To further develop the long and traditional relationship\nwith Russia by increased cooperation in trade, technology,\ndefence and other security related areas. India and Russia\nhave many common interests in Asia and we will strive\nfor greater cooperation to serve them;\n\n10. To strengthen political and economic relations with the\nEuropean Unions, ASEAN countries, Japan, South Korea,\nSouth Africa, Iran, the Arab nations, Israel, Central Asian\nrepublics and fellow Commonwealth nations;\n\nUntitled-10 193 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM\n\f\n194 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n11. To take active steps to persuade Pakistan to abandon its\npresent policy of hostile interference in our internal affairs\nby supporting insurgent and terrorist groups. The BJP\naffirms unequivocally India\u2019s sovereignty over the whole\nof Jammu and Kashmir, including the areas under foreign\noccupations;\n\n12. To improve relations with China by seeking speedy\nresolution of the outstanding border problem. Even\nwhile doing so we will seek greater cross-border trade\nand cooperation in other areas. We are also concerned\nabout China continuing transfer of advanced weapons\nand technologies to Pakistan as this has a vital bearing\non our ties with China;\n\n13. To support a united Sri Lanka within which the\nlegitimate aspirations of the Tamil people should be fully\naccommodated. The BJP greatly regrets the continuing\nbloodshed particularly since the Indian people have long\nstanding, traditional and fraternal ties with the Sri Lankan\npeople;\n\n14. To maintain the unique, warm and friendly relations with\nNepal with which India has the closest cultural, religious\nand historical ties. We will seek to widen existing areas\nof cooperation and also develop new avenues of fruitful\ncooperation. We recognize in particular the great scope\nfor increasing cooperation in the energy and environment\nrelated areas. A BJP Government will seek to resolve all\noutstanding issues quickly;\n\n15. To further improve relationship with Myanmar with which\nIndia has a long border and age-old cultural, religious and\nhistorical ties. There is much scope for greater cooperation\nin the fields of defence, security, economy and culture;\n\n16. To further consolidate the close and friendly ties between\nIndia and Bhutan;\n\n17. To reinforce the improving relations with Bangladesh.\nWe however continue to view with concern the unabated\nillegal infiltration into India from that country and will\nseek the active participation of the Bangladesh authorities\nin curbing this; and,\n\n18.

The internal and external security environment has\ndeteriorated sharply in the last decade. The previous Governments\nhave been found wanting in their efforts and determination to face\nthese threats and are responsible for this. Since 1991, the country\u2019s\ndefence budget has been declining in real terms. They have declined\nfrom 3.4 per cent of the GDP in 1989-90 to a mere 2.2 per cent this\nyear. Successive weak and irresolute Governments have imperiled\nnational security. There is a mistaken view that there is a conflict\nbetween national security and economic development. But these\ntwo go hand-in-hand. There cannot be economic development\nwithout commensurate security preparation and the reverse, too,\nis equally true.\n\nThe dimensions and directions of present and future threats\nneed to be constantly analyzed and evaluated. In the glaring absence\nof governmental interest and inter-ministerial coordination, the\nmechanisms for this have fallen into disuse. The armed forces have\nbeen ignored in defence policy planning. Misguided bureaucratic\ninterference has demoralized the higher echelons of the armed\nforces and has also had a telling effect on defence preparedness.\nThe BJP Government will take immediate steps to reverse such\nnegative trends and establish coordination between the armed\nforces and the Government at all levels.\n\nThe BJP notes with concern the inadequate pace of defence\nresearch and development despite abundant talent available in\nDRDO. Inadequate budgetary support is a major reason for this.\nThe inordinate delays in the LCA, nuclear submarine and guided\n\nUntitled-10 196 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 197\n\nmissiles, and other programmes are matters of particular concern.\nOur scientists and technologists are second to none and it is lack of\npolitical will and clarity on strategic issues that is the main cause of\nthe delay. Defence production performance, too, has not been up to\nthe mark. The performance of defence production units need to be\nmonitored more closely and brought up to acceptable commercial\nand international standards.\n\nA National Commission will study and analyze the trends in\ndefence technologies and appropriately advise the Government on\nthe development and induction of advanced weapons.\n\nExternal Security\n\nTHE frenetic pace of military expansion and modernization\nby some of our neighbors and the growing pressure and power of\nforeign navies in the Indian Ocean compel us to take the state of\nour defence preparedness very seriously. We also cannot remain\noblivious to the new developments in weapon technology and\nthe induction of very advanced conventional weapons systems\nin the region by some power. These must be neutralized. We are,\ntherefore, committed to:\n\n1. Establish a National Security Council to constantly analyze\nsecurity, political and economic threats and render\ncontinuous advice to the Government. This Council will\nundertake India\u2019s first-ever Strategic Defence Review to\nstudy and analyze the security environment and make\nappropriate recommendations to cover all aspects of\ndefence requirements and organization;\n\n2. Re-evaluate the country\u2019s nuclear policy and exercise the\noption to induct nuclear weapons;\n\n3. Expedite the development of the Agni series of ballistic\nmissiles with a view to increasing their range and accuracy;\n\n4. Increase the radius of power projection by inducting\nappropriate force multipliers such as battlefield surveillance\nsystems and air-to-air refueling;\n\n5. Enhance the traditional and technical capabilities of our\nexternal intelligence agencies and also to increase the\ninteraction and co-ordination with user departments; and,\n\n6. Place para-military forces in sensitive border areas under\nthe full control of the Indian Army.\n\nUntitled-10 197 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM\n\f\n198 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nJai Jawan\n\nTHE country is justly proud of its soldiers who constantly\nbrave the elements, endure extreme hardships and risk their lives\nto defend the nation. Service in the armed forces must be made\nattractive for young people and must be considered a honour.\nConsequently:\n\n1. The BJP Government will take measures to make\nemployment in the armed forces more rewarding and\nsecure for soldiers greater respect of society;\n\n2. The BJP Government will suitably improve living and\nservice conditions and expeditiously rectify existing\nanomalies;\n\n3. The BJP Government will recognize the services and\nsacrifices of retired personnel and attend to their problems\nimmediately;\n\n4. The BJP Government will increase the benefits and\ncompensation to widows and dependents of service\npersonnel who die in action;\n\n5. The BJP Government will be committed to increasing\navenues of lateral induction into other security forces and\nother Government departments/undertakings/agencies\nfor retired officers and jawans; and,\n\n6. The BJP Government will appoint a committee to examine\nthe question of retirement age at different levels in the\narmed forces and make appropriate recommendation to\nthis effect.\n\nInternal Security\n\nTHE BJP will give utmost attention to security-sensitive areas\nin the North, the North-East and the South. The BJP Government\nwill review the role and performance of the police organizations\nand take urgent steps to revitalize them. We recognize the need\nfor the permanent cadre officers in CPO\u2019s to have greater avenues\nfor advancement.\n\nThe BJP Government will ensure far greater co-ordination\nbetween the armed forces, police organizations and the administration\nin areas beset with insurgency and terrorism. Armed insurgents\nand foreign mercenaries will be eliminated. Our security forces will\n\nUntitled-10 198 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 199\n\nbe given a free hand to deal with armed insurgency and terrorism.\nThe BJP Government will revamp the intelligence agencies to\nenhance their effectiveness and ensure greater coordination with\nsecurity and police forces.\nCentral and State Police Forces will be reorganized and\nmodernized while simultaneously improving working and living\nconditions of their personnel.\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\nWE welcome the restoration of an elected Government in\nthe State. The BJP Government will take suitable measures for\nestablishing a durable peace in the State to promote progress\nand prosperity. Repeated massacres of Hindus in Kashmir show\nthat unless the State Government takes the business of curbing\nmilitancy seriously, durable peace will be hard to achieve. The BJP\nGovernment will strive for a more structured coordination between\nthe Central forces and the State Government.\n\nNorth-East\n\nTHE conditions in the North-Eastern States continue to be\ndisturbed. The situation in Assam in particular has worsened\nin the last few years. It is the Congress Party\u2019s manipulative\nand corrupt politics that have contributed most to this. Poor\ngovernance, corrupt and callous administration, the flow of\nnarcotics and foreign interference have together contributed\nto the rapid deterioration of the law and order situation. The\nunchecked and unabated illegal infiltration from Bangladesh has\nbeen the single largest causative factor in destabilizing the region.\nThe spread of heroin addiction and HIV infection in some States\nis cause for utmost concern.\n\nThe BJP will give socio-economic problems of this region\nhigh priority as lack of development has helped anti-national and\nseparatist elements in their attempt to foment disaffection. We\nbelieve development is one of the effective antidotes against such\nattempts.\n\nThe distance between this region and Delhi has further\nheightened their sense of alienation. Nothing has been done in\nthe past 50 years to bridge this physical and emotional distance.\nThe BJP commits itself to forging new and strong economic and\n\nUntitled-10 199 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM\n\f\n200 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nemotional bonds between the North-East and the rest of India.\n\nTherefore, we propose to do the following in the North-East:\n\n1. Draw up and implement a comprehensive development\nprogramme, focusing on basic communications\ninfrastructure like roads, railways, bridges and air link;\n\n2. Harness the immense hydro-electric potential in the region\nboth for rapid development of these States as well as for\naugmenting the power supply of eastern States, thus\nenabling the North-East region to mobilise additional\nresources;\n\n3. Put into place effective checks and balances to prevent\nseepage of development funds which should reach the\npeople of the region and not be pocketed by a corrupt\nfew.\n\n4. Strengthen the North-Eastern Council to effectively oversee\nand speed up the social and economic development of the\nregion.\n\n5. The security apparatus will be strengthened to check\ninfiltration, stem the flow of narcotics and weapons and\neliminate insurgents;\n\n6. Provide all citizens in the region with identity cards;\n\n7. It will strengthen the North-Eastern Council to effectively\noversee and speed up the social and economic development\nof the region;\n\n8. Repeal the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunal\nAct (IMDTA) and strengthen existing immigration laws\nand rules; and,\n\n9. Enact new laws and rules to make illegal infiltration\ndifficult and deny the extension of benefits of citizenship\nto such entrants.\n\nIllegal Infiltration\n\nTHE Congress and United Front Governments for their own\nnarrow and selfish reasons have been deliberately negligent of this\nproblem. The total number of illegal infiltrators from Bangladesh\nis officially ascertained at over 1.7 crore. The adverse impact of\nthis on our economy and social and political order poses problems\nof grave magnitude. This cannot be allowed to continue. Our\nGovernment will:\n\nUntitled-10 200 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 201\n\n1. Take more stringent measures to intercept illegal infiltrators\nand turn them back. Fencing of the border wherever\npossible will be urgently taken up. Border patrolling will\nbe intensified;\n\n2. Initiate steps to detect illegal infiltrators and delete their\nnames from electoral rolls; and,\n\n3. Maintain a national register of citizens.\n\nThe BJP has the vision and the political will to transform India\ninto a prosperous and powerful nation in the initial decades of the\nnext century. A strong and secure India is an essential requisite\nfor this.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 201 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM\n\f\nOur Social Philosophy\n\nRooted in Integral Humanism\n\nTHE Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s social agenda flows from\nits ideology of Integral Humanism. Our ideology rules out\ncontradictions between society and its very components, as also\nbetween society and the individual. Our concern for the last man in\nthe last row is as deep as that for the first man in the first row, if not\nmore. The BJP\u2019s concept of social justice, therefore, does not seek to\ncreate rifts and schisms between various sections of society, but aims\nat removing social and economic disparities that have resulted in\ndenial of a share in power, impoverishment and erosion of human\ndignity. An ideal society is not one that is compartmentalized in\nsegments, but is an integral whole, harmonious and conflict-free.\nHence, we subscribe to Samajik Samarasata (social harmony) and\nSamajik Nyaya (social justice) and strive to avoid social strife.\n\nEqual Rights for all in Satta (power), Sampatti (prosperity) and\nSamman (dignity)\n\n1. The BJP will actively promote a casteless socio-economic\norder that will effectively provide access to equal\nopportunity for all citizens, irrespective of their caste,\ncreed, religion and gender.\n\n2. The BJP will, if necessary through legislation, dismantle\npractices, customs, beliefs, usages and institutions, which\nin any manner hurt the dignity of an individual.\n\n3. The BJP will ensure that the place of an individual in\nsociety is not determined on the basis of his/her birth.\n\nUntitled-10 202 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 203\n\nUntouchability: A Crime Against Humanity\n\n1. The BJP will remove the last vestiges of untouchability,\nwhich we believe is an unpardonable crime against\nhumanity.\n\n2. The BJP will strive to inculcate an ethos of equality in\nsocial and inter-personal relationships.\n\n3. A befitting National Memorial in honour of Dr. Babasaheb\nAmbedkar, who dedicated his life to the cause of social\njustice, will be erected at Chaityabhoomi in Mumbai on\nthe lines of national memorials like Raj Ghat, Shanti Van\nand Vijay Ghat.\n\nOur Commitment to the Welfare of Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes\n\nNEARLY four-and-a-half decades of Congress rule and the\nrecent UF regime have failed to empower the Scheduled Castes\nand the Scheduled Tribes. While thousands of crores have been\nspent, ostensibly for their welfare, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes face increasing impoverishment and marginalization. Eighty\nper cent of members belonging to these sections of Indian society\nhave been pushed below the poverty line. The BJP is committed to\nthe social, economic and political empowerment of the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes, so that the wrongs of the past are\ncorrected in a time-bound manner for a better future. To fulfill\nour commitment, we will be guided by a policy whose highlights\nare as follows:\n\n1. Existing institutions and Constitutional safeguards\nfor Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes will be\nstrengthened and made operationally more effective.\n\n2. The provision of special facilities and preferential\nopportunities, including reservations, will be implemented\nina manner so as to benefit the broadest cross-section and\nlargest number of SCs and STs.\n\n3. The reservations policy will be backed up with a statute\nand all backlogs will be cleared within a specified time-\nframe. Special tribunals will be set up under CAT to\nexpeditiously deal with complaints of non-implementation\nof the reservations policy and related grievances.\n\n4. All cases of atrocities against members of the Scheduled\n\nUntitled-10 203 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM\n\f\n204 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes will be promptly inquired\n\ninto and the guilty punished through special courts.\n\n5. Acomprehensive development package will be introduced\nfor the economic empowerment of Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes. The highlights of this package will\ninclude:\n\n(a) Setting up of a credit agency on the lines of NABARD\nto meet individual and institutional credit needs;\n\n(b) Vocational training, skill upgradation and financial\nassistance to encourage greater participation in\ncottage and rural industries and other means of self-\nemployment;\n\n(c) Food-for-education schemes to raise literacy levels;\n\n(d) A comprehensive national programme of minor\nirrigation facilities for irrigable land held by SCs and\nSTs;\n\n(e) Endowing every landless rural family of the SCs and\nSTs with land and ensuring sustenance level of income\nthrough requisite facilities;\n\n(f) Amending the existing forest policy to provide Vanvasis\ntheir rightful share of minor forest produce;\n\n(g) Processing claims of Vanvasis and Girijans for pattas\nin forest and hill areas promptly; and,\n\n(h) Separate development plans for tribals living in the\nplains.\n\n6. The specified allocation for the Special Component Plan (17\nper cent) for Scheduled Castes and the Tribal Sub-Plan (8 per\ncent) for Scheduled Tribes within the total Plan allocation\nwill be strictly followed both at the Centre and in the States.\nEvery effort will be made to ensure that allocated funds do\nnot lapse and are spent as per Plan provisions.\n\n7. The pernicious practice of carrying night soil will be\neliminated and all those engaged in scavenging rehabilitated.\n\n8. Allotment of pattas for land, home site and homes in the\nnames of wives/widows/ daughters. These will be properly\ndrawn up and handed over to actual beneficiaries;\n\n9. Unifying the Banjaras under a common category and\nensuring that they are benefited by the Minimum Needs\nProgramme;\n\nUntitled-10 204 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 205\n\n10. Necessary steps to stop the exploitation of tribals by\ncontractors and to free them from indebtedness. We will\nconsider enacting a law whereby the outstanding debts\nof those tribals who have paid back the principal amount\nand 50 per cent of the capital as interest, will be written\noff;\n\n11. Stringent action to prevent tribal land alienation through\nconversion of tribal land for industrial and other purposes;\n\n12. A National Policy for the \u2018total rehabilitation\u2019 of families\ndisplaced by development projects. The policy will include\nsocial, economic, educational, environmental, occupational\nand cultural aspects;\n\n13. An engineering and a medical college will be set up\nin the national capital in honour of Maharishi Valmiki\nand Babasaheb Ambedkar. Fifty per cent seats in these\ninstitutions will be reserved for students from Scheduled\nCastes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs;\n\n14. Panchayat institutions in scheduled areas and tribal areas\nwill be made effective and functional in the light of Bhuria\nCommittee\u2019s recommendations;\n\n15. Claims for inclusion into the ST list by erstwhile \u2018criminal\u2019\ntribes and others will be entrusted to a commission for\nrecommendations.\n\nOur Commitment to the Welfare of Socially and Educationally\nBackward Classes\n\nTHE BJP is committed to ensuring social and economic justice\nto the Other Backward Classes. This is integral to our concept of\nSocial Harmony (Samajik Samarasata). We reject the divisive and\ncasteist politics of our adversaries that have neither economically\nempowered the bulk of the OBCs nor reduced their educational\nbackwardness. We propose to:\n\n1. Continue with the current reservations policy for the Other\nBackward Classes till they are socially and educationally\nintegrated with the rest of society;\n\n2. Provide training, financial support and management\nfacilities for upgradation of skills in traditional industries\nand professions of OBCs;\n\n3. Take corrective and remedial measures in view of recent\n\nUntitled-10 205 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM\n\f\n206 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nmacro-economic policy decisions that have rendered\nseveral sections of people belonging to the OBCs jobless;\nand,\n\n4. Make the National Backward Classes Finance Development\nCorporation fully operational.\n\nOur Commitment to Minorities: Towards Equal Opportunity\nand Prosperity\nTHE BJP\u2019s concept of Positive Secularism is: Justice for All,\nAppeasement of None. In the name of \u2018secularism\u2019, the Congress and\nthe United Front parties have shamelessly pandered to communalism\nand indulged in \u2018vote-bank politics\u2019. As a result, members of the\nminority communities have been reduced to nothing more than\nnumbers to be played with at the time of elections. While these\nparties have gained, the minorities have lost \u2014as also has India. The\nminorities have been cynically used for the purpose of garnering\nvotes these past 50 years, but their socio-economic problems have\nremained unattended. The true meaning of \u2018secularism\u2019, equal\nrespect for all faith\u2014sarva panth samadar\u2014has been perverted by\nthe pseudo-secularists into appeasement of regressive elements.\nThe coming election provides a window of opportunity to\nthe minorities to take a fresh look at the options that are available\nto them. They should not go blindly with the so-called \u2018secular\u2019\nparties that have done nothing to solve their real socio-economic\nproblems. Instead, they should make a clean break with the past\nand support the BJP. The patron-client relationship advocated\nby others is different from what we offer\u2014equal rights, equal\nopportunities, equal privileges and equal responsibilities. Above all,\nwe have proved in the States where the BJP is in power that we can\nmaintain communal peace and harmony; we can ensure security of\nlife and property; and, we can protect the honour and dignity of the\nminority communities. In keeping with this commitment, we will:\n1. Provide all minority communities with equal opportunities\nfor prosperity;\n2. Encourage access to education which is the key to social\nand economic progress;\n3. Give all incentives to artisans, especially those involved\nin traditional arts and crafts;\n\nUntitled-10 206 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 207\n\n4. Initiate special self-employment schemes and the requisite\ntraining programmes;\n\n5. Launch community programmes for raising the level\nof awareness among women members of the minority\ncommunities and providing them with education;\n\n6. Amend Article 30 of the Constitution suitably to remove any\nscope of discrimination against any religious community\nin matters of education;\n\n7. Entrust the responsibilities of the Minorities Commission\nto the Human Rights Commission, thus providing greater\nprotection to members of minority communities;\n\n8. Set up special courts to try cases of communal violence\nand, if necessary, amend existing laws to provide for\nexemplary punishment to those inciting or taking part in\ncommunal or sectarian violence. The BJP\u2019s commitment\nis to create a riot-free India;\n\n9. Protect wakf properties from being usurped by unscrupulous\nindividuals and help wakf boards to develop these\nproperties for the welfare of poor Muslim families; and,\n\n10. Ban job advertisements which require applicants to declare\ntheir religion.\n\nOur Commitment to Kashmiri Pandits\nSEPARATIST and sectarian militancy in Jammu and Kashmir\nduring the late \u201c80s and right up to the mid \u201990s resulted in mass\nmigration from the Valley and other areas in Kashmir. More than\n300,000 people, including 250,000 Kashmiri Pandits and Pandits,\nand Punjabi and Dogra Hindus, apart from Muslims, were forced\nto flee their home and hearth in the Valley by terrorists and\nfundamentalists. The BJP promises immediate action to help those\ndisplaced from the Kashmir Valley and other parts of the State.\nTowards this end, we propose to:\n1. Work with the Jammu and Kashmir Government to evolve\na feasible scheme for the phased return of the displaced\npeople, especially the Pandits, to their ancient land;\n2. Provide all assistance to the Jammu and Kashmir\nGovernment in order to ensure that the displaced people\nreceive adequate financial assistance, health care, housing,\n\nUntitled-10 207 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM\n\f\n208 * Party Document Vol-1\n\neducation and employment facilities till such time they\nare able to return to their land;\n\n3. Evolve a rehabilitation package, including adequate\nassistance to rebuild houses that have been destroyed,\nthat will be an incentive for returning to the Valley; and,\n\n4. Ensure that their security is inno way imperiled after they\nhave returned to the land from which they were forced\nout against their will.\n\nOur Commitment to Human Rights\n\nTHE BJP believes that upholding human dignity, ensuring\njustice for all and protecting citizens from the tyranny of the State\nare integral to India\u2019s ancient traditions and together form the\ncornerstone of civil society. A just State is one that is kind but also\nfirm in dealing with those who seek to undermine the foundations\nof a civil society. We will:\n\n1. Make the National Human Rights Commission a more\neffective body by providing it with more powers, additional\nresources and better infrastructural support;\n\n2. Publicize the findings of the National Human Rights\nCommission and take action against those found guilty\non the basis of irrefutable evidence;\n\n3. Inculcate among security forces a greater appreciation of\nthe need to safeguard innocent citizens from being harassed\nin insurgency-affected areas; and,\n\n4. Include the study of human, civil and democratic rights\nin school and college curriculum.\n\n5. Prevent foreign interference in the internal affairs of our\ncountry under the guise of monitoring human rights\nviolations.\n\nNon-Resident Indians\n\nTHE BJP believes that Mother India has a special responsibility\ntowards her children abroad. We will depart from the current\npolicy of disinterest and disregard for Non-Resident Indians\nand actively pursue a policy that will nourish the umbilical link\nbetween all people of Indian origin, wherever they may be, with\ntheir motherland. We propose to:\n\n1. Create conditions conducive to the return of talented\nNon-Resident Indians so that they can fulfill their desire\n\nUntitled-10 208 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 209\n\nto serve their motherland;\n\n2. Strengthen the economic, social, cultural, emotional and\nspiritual links between Mother India and her children\nabroad;\n\n3. Re-examine difficulties in granting dual citizenship to\nNon-Resident Indians;\n\n4. Mobilize Non-Resident Indians to effectively lobby India\u2019s\ncase with the Governments and business establishments of\ntheir host country as well as in international fora. In this\ncontext, it would be instructive to study the role of Jews\nand Chinese in the USA in mobilizing opinion favorable\nto their countries;\n\n5. Encourage Indians living abroad to project their national\nidentity even while retaining their respective regional and\nlinguistic identities;\n\n6. Introduce fresh incentives for Non-Resident Indians to\ninvest in their motherland, like China has done with the\nChinese people living abroad;\n\n7. Play an active role in ensuring job and social security for\nNon-Resident Indians working in the Gulf and South-\nEast Asian countries with special emphasis on preventing\nexploitation and providing legal assistance; and,\n\n8. Revitalize the ties between Mother India and people o\nIndian origin living in countries like Guyana, West Indies,\nFiji, Mauritius and South Africa.\n\n \n\noO\n\nUntitled-10 209 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM\n\f\nNari Shakti\n\nEmpowerment of Women\n\nTHE BJP believes that true human development cannot take place\nwithout the empowerment of women. It is not enough to talk about\nremoving discrimination against women and establishing gender\nequality. We need to create new mechanisms for the social, political\nand economic advancement of women as also to generate social\nawareness on gender issues. One such mechanism is empowerment,\nincluding empowerment through enactment of laws. Yet another\nmechanism is capacity-building through education and skill\nacquisition. The BJP pledges itself to legal and policy level initiatives\nto remove discrimination against women and to ensure that their\nrights and dignity are not trampled upon. Special emphasis will\nbe laid on the rights of the girl child. To harness the full potential\nof Nari Shakti, the BJP will:\n\n1. Provide free education to women up to graduation, including\nprofessional studies like medicine and engineering;\n\n2. Immediately seek the passage of the Bill reserving 33 per\ncent seats for women in all elected bodies, including the\nLok Sabha and State Assemblies;\n\n3. Actively promote the legal and economic rights of women\nwhich must be equal to those of men and not subject to\nthe debilitating clauses of personal laws;\n\n4. Entrust the Law Commission to formulate a Uniform Civil\nCode based on the progressive practices from all traditions.\nThis Code will:\n\n(a) Give women property rights;\n(b) Ensure women\u2019s right to adopt;\n(c) Guarantee women equal guardianship rights;\n\nUntitled-10 210 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 211\n\n(d) Remove discriminatory clauses in divorce laws;\n(e) Put an end to polygamy;\n(f) Make registration of all marriages mandatory.\n\n5. Create conditions in society and workplace to ensure equal\nopportunities in matters of employment and promotion;\n\n6. Enact and enforce an anti-sexual harassment code;\n\n7. Enforce the principle of equal wages for equal work, both\nin the organized as well as unorganized sector;\n\n8. Encourage the introduction of part-time and take-home\njob schemes for working mothers;\n\n9. Promote a health-care system, especially in rural areas,\nthat will focus on the non-reproductive health needs of\nwomen;\n\n10. Provide assistance to single and working mothers and\nintroduce a forward-looking housing policy for their\nbenefit;\n\n11. Work with State Governments to establish adequate number\nof working women\u2019s hostels and short-stay homes for\ndestitute women;\n\n12. Make women partners in the management of community\nassets and properties in rural areas;\n\n13. Enroll the help of panchayats to set up latrines for women\nin rural areas;\n\n14. Expand the scope of the existing micro-credit system\nthrough an enlarged corpus to which both the Union and\nState Governments, apart from banks, will make liberal\ncontributions;\n\n15. Encourage the setting up of cooperative societies in rural\nand urban areas to be managed by women for the benefit\nof women entrepreneurs;\n\n16. Introduce skill-based training programmes and self-\nemployment schemes which are area-specific and job-\nspecific;\n\n17. Design special functional literacy programmes for women\nwho have been denied access to education;\n\n18. Amend laws that deal with molestation, rape and dowry,\nto provide for in-camera trial, swift justice and tough\ndeterrent punishment as well as rehabilitation of the\nvictims of these crimes;\n\nUntitled-10 211 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM\n\f\n212 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n19. Amend the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act to make\nclients as culpable as commercial sex-workers;\n\n20. Strictly enforce age of consent laws and launch a vigorous\ncampaign against child prostitution by making it a\ncognizable offense;\n\n21. Establish family courts in residential areas for speedy\ndisposal of family dispute;\n\n22. Mention of mother\u2019s name will be made mandatory on all\nofficial documents, starting from a child\u2019s birth certificate\nto a person\u2019s death certificate;\n\n23. Set up special courts in every district for the expeditious\ntrial of all civil and criminal cases in which women are\nthe accused;\n\n24. Rapidly induct more women in the police force and appoint\nwomen to senior positions as well as increase the number\nof \u2018Crimes Against Women Cells\u2019 so that no police station\narea is left uncovered by the year 2003;\n\n25. Enact and strictly implement a special law to deal with\ndomestic violence against women;\n\n26. Promote a social agenda designed to discourage negative\ninfluences and end discrimination against the girl child\nin any form;\n\n27. Strictly enforce the existing laws that prohibit unethical\npractices like pre-natal sex-determination tests, female\nfoeticide and infanticide;\n\n28. Invest in the girl child\u2019s health, nutrition and education,\nfrom infancy through adolescence, by formulating\nappropriate programmes and incentive schemes;\n\n29. Universalize primary and secondary education to narrow\nthe gender gap;\n\n30. Prevent media\u2019s projection of women in any manner that\ndemeans them or hurts their dignity; and,\n\n31. Set up a national-level apex women\u2019s development bank\non the lines of NABARD and SIDBI. There is need for\nsetting up a dedicated development bank to cater to the\nfinancing needs of women entrepreneurs and the vast\nnumber of self-employed women.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 212 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM\n\f\nOur Population Policy\n\nMaking it a People\u2019s Movement\n\nTHE BJP views India\u2019s runaway population growth with all the\nconcern it deserves. Expected to hit the one billion mark by the\nyear 2001, India\u2019s population is set to overtake that of China\nunless the growth rate is checked and then reversed. The danger\nof a runaway population growth is there for all to see: A rapidly\nexpanding population means a slower rate at which development\ncan be effected. While India was one of the first countries in the\nworld to recognize the need to control the growth of its population\nin order to ensure a better distribution of the fruits of development,\nsuccessive Union Governments have failed in the implementation\nof this important programme. Excesses during the Emergency have\ngiven way to complacence and dangerous negligence. The BJP will\nput population-related issues, including family planning, firmly\nback on the national agenda. The BJP believes that the country\u2019s\nrunaway population growth can be arrested and rolled back\nthrough increased awareness, facilitating access to family planning\nmeasures, persuasive Government policies and rapid development.\nIt is an universally acknowledged fact that \u2018development is the best\ncontraceptive.\u2019 But we realize that Government alone cannot fulfill\nthis gigantic task. The Government's efforts must be supplemented\nby a vigorous people\u2019s movement. In addition, the BJP proposes to:\n1. Formulate a National Population Policy by acting on the\nreports of the National Development Council and the\nSwaminathan Committee. This Policy will seek to bring\nthe population growth close to stabilization by the year\n\n2010;\n2. Provide incentives to those who opt for the \u2018two-child\u2019\n\nUntitled-10 213 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM\n\f\n214 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nnorm and high incentives to those who embrace the \u2018single-\nchild\u2019 norm;\n\n3. Take all measures for reducing infant mortality rates and\nimproving child health;\n\n4. Promote women\u2019s education, employment and\nempowerment since these can be effective means of\npopulation control as they will allow women a decisive\nrole in regard to their reproductive health and family\nplanning;\n\n5. Introduce disincentives which will apply to all sections of\nsociety in order to discourage large, unsustainable families;\n\n6. Ensure universal access to family planning information\nand quality contraceptive facilities by involving non-\ngovernment organizations and promote awareness\namong the people, especially women, through counseling,\neducational programmes and widest use of modern\nmultimedia capabilities;\n\n7. Introduce family planning methods and facilities that will\nallow women greater freedom of choice without imperiling\ntheir health as well as support research relating to these\nmethods;\n\n8. Encourage women to seek reproductive health services\nas well as launch a special campaign to educate local\ncommunities about negative practices;\n\n9. Offer a special incentive in the form of a fixed deposit that\nwill mature in 21 years for those couples who have only a\ngirl child or those who adopt a girl child under a \u2018Dattak\nPutri Yojana\u2019;\n\n10. Make family planning an integral part of our development\npolicies to ensure widest applicability of these incentives\nand disincentives and provide motivation for a small\nfamily norm; and,\n\n11. Ensure that the legal age of marriage is strictly implemented.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 214 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM\n\f\nOur Policy for India\u2019s Youth\nYuva Shakti for Rashtra Shakti\n\nOUR youth are the strength of the family, village, locality and\nthe community. They are also the biceps or triceps of the nation.\nThey are the most idealistic, inspired and energetic section of\nour nation. But in the absence of a driving national vision and a\ncredible national leadership, their energy has remained dormant or\ngot misdirected. Today, the youth of India see the BJP with great\nhope and we see them with equally great hope as the inheritors of\nIndia in the 21st century.\n\nThe BJP recognizes their immense creative potential to effect\npositive social, cultural and political changes. We pledge to create\na conducive environment and a supportive policy framework for\nthe full realization of this potential.\n\nTowards this end, we will unveil a National Youth Policy,\nfor the implementation of which our Government will set aside\nsubstantial budgetary resources. A permanent National Youth\nCommission will be set up to monitor the implementation.\n\nPromotion of a Robust Sports and Physical Culture\n\nSPORTS has been neglected since Independence and the\nblame must be shared by both the Government and society. Also\nneglected is the development of a hardy physical culture, which\nalone provides the necessary basis on which a nation can promote\nexcellence in sports. It is a national shame that India, the second\nmost populous country in the world, almost never finds a place in\nthe medals tally in the Olympic Games. It is a sad commentary on\nour sports culture that, in a country of nearly one billion people,\nwe have not more than 2,000 top-ranking sportsmen and women.\n\nUntitled-10 215 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM\n\f\n216 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nTo promote Indian sports to attain international recognition and\nto develop a sports ethos in India, the BJP will:\n\n1. Make physical education and sports coaching compulsory\nup to the +2 stage.\n\n2. Make a substantial budgetary allocation for instituting\nmethods to identify and train sports talent.\n\n3. Look for sports talent outside the educational institutions,\nparticularly in villages and in coastal areas.\n\n4. Promote traditional Indian sports and, in association with\nneighboring countries, make them international sports.\n\n5. The functioning of sports bodies will be immediately freed\nfrom all bureaucratic and political interference.\n\n6. A yearly Rural Sports Meet and (depending on the\nconcentration of tribal population) a Tribal Sports Meet\nwill be held in each village, taluka, district and State.\n\n7. With regard to India\u2019s participation in the Olympics and\nother international games, a well-conceived, long-term\npolicy will be evolved to achieve success.\n\nBharat Punarnirman Vahini\n\nTHE BJP Government will unveil a nationwide scheme to tap\nthe spirit of voluntary service among the youth and channel it for\nthe realization of twin goals: Self-growth and Nation-building. The\nscheme envisages the setting up of a Bharat Punarnirman Vahini,\nwhose youthful voluntary members will devote one year of their\nlife for national reconstruction. They will take part in diverse\nactivities such as rural reconstruction, water maintenance, social\nforestry, public health, environment protection, social harmony,\nadult literacy and preservation of traditional knowledge systems.\nInitially, this scheme will be taken up on an experimental basis in\na few pilot districts from different parts of the country.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 216 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM\n\f\nFamily and Society\n\nPreserving Integrity of the Family\n\nIN the Indian view of life, an individual is not an independent or\nsovereign being, but an integral member of the family, community,\nthe nation and the human race. The basic institution that anchors\nthe individual in society and the nation, as also links him to the past\nand the future, is the family. The BJP believes that the integrity of\nthe family institution is the main guarantor of India\u2019s civilizational\ncontinuity. Hence, the importance of protection and nurturing of\nfamily values cannot be overstated in the context of nation-building.\nIf the family is the brick, society is the edifice.\n\nOur Charter for Children: No Child Shall Go To Sleep Hungry\n\nTHE BJP believes that children are born\u2014and have the\nright\u2014to be happy; they have the right to food, shelter and clothes;\nthey have the right to education. But the facts as they exist paint a\ndismal picture. India has a high infant mortality rate. Many children\nsuffer from malnutrition and hunger. The majority of them have\nno access to education. Deprived of their childhood, millions of\nchildren have to work to feed themselves and contribute to the\nfamily income. Constitutional provisions and legal safeguards have\nbeen followed more in the breach than in practice. There are more\nchildren working in factories and fields than in schools; there are\nmore children living in deprivation than in secure homes. The BJP,\nin keeping with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, will\nensure that the \u2018best interests\u2019 of India\u2019s children are taken into\naccount in all situations. Children\u2019s rights are the foundation on\nwhich better societies can be built and, therefore, we will implement\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child in both letter and spirit.\n\nUntitled-10 217 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM\n\f\n218 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nTowards this end, we will protect:\n\n1. Children\u2019s right to survive and develop to their full\npotential;\n\n2. Children\u2019s right to the highest attainable standard of health\ncare through compulsory health check and by strengthening\nthe ICDS;\n\nChildren\u2019s right to be registered immediately after birth;\n\n4. Children\u2019s right to protection from all forms of sexual\nexploitation and sexual abuse;\n\n5. Children\u2019s right to play;\n\n6. Children\u2019s right to education; and,\n\n7. Children\u2019s right to shelter.\n\nAs we step into the next millennium, child labour must be\nleft behind, consigned to history as completely as those other\nforms of slavery that it so closely resembles. We will amend the\npresent Child labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act to remove\nthe distinction between hazardous and non-hazardous processes.\nWe will achieve the goal of wiping out the scourge of child labour\nin factories and fields through:\n\n1. Regular and persistent inspections by labour departments\n\nat the Centre and in the States;\n\n2. Special annual campaigns to detect child employment;\n\n3. Identity cards which will be mandatory for all young\nworkers;\n\n4. Welfare benefits, especially social assistance to poor\nfamilies, aimed at ensuring a minimum income and thus\nremoving the need to rely on their children\u2019s labour;\n\n5. Free and compulsory primary education.\n\nNo nation has the moral authority to claim prosperity if its\nchildren are hungry. The BJP promises that by the year 2000, no\nchild who attends primary school will go to sleep hungry. We will\ndevise a suitable scheme with full community participation to keep\nthis solemn promise.\n\n\u00bb\n\nCaring for our Disabled\n\nAS many as fifty million Indians are denied the chance\nto participate in the nation-building process because of\ntheir physical and other disabilities. Rather than recognize\nthe contributory potential of these differently abled men\n\nUntitled-10 218 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 219\n\nand women, they are socially, economically and politically\nmarginalized. Successive Congress Governments, as well as\nthe UF regime which made cynical use of the slogan of \u2018social\njustice\u2019, have done nothing to empower the disabled. Budgetary\nallocation to help the disabled amounts to less than pittance.\nParliament passed a Bill for the welfare of the disabled, but it\nis yet to be implemented in both letter and spirit. The BJP will\nadopt a holistic approach towards the disabled so that they\nare able to contribute their mite to the nation-building process\ninstead of being condemned to the margins of society. Towards\nthis end, the BJP will:\n\n1. Conduct a special census to collect accurate data about\nthe number of disabled people and the nature of their\ndisability in order to formulate an effective policy;\n\n2. Emphasize on empowerment and development of the\nabilities of the disabled into specific skills;\n\n3. Ensure access to public services and public places, to begin\nwith in metropolitan cities;\n\n4. Provide employment in suitable categories of Government\nservice through a pro-active \u2018equal opportunities\u2019\nprogramme;\n\n5. Offer incentives to the private sector to introduce a similar\n\u2018equal opportunities\u2019 scheme in suitable job categories;\nand,\n\n6. Encourage State Governments to set up centres for\ncounseling and skill acquisition.\n\nCaring for our Senior Citizens\nINDIAN family and social traditions have always held elders\nin high esteem. A person who attains the status of an \u2018elder\u2019 and\na \u2018senior citizen\u2019 is looked upon as a repository of experience,\nvalues and wisdom, which need to be transmitted to the younger\ngeneration. Sadly, the alien nature of socio-economic development\nin India in the past fifty years has brought the institution of family\nunder great pressure. One of the worst victims of this process are\nour senior citizens.\n1. Our Government, in line with the BJP\u2019s philosophy, will\ntake all possible measures to alleviate the difficulties and\nhardships suffered by our senior citizens.\n\nUntitled-10 219 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM\n\f\n220 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n2. We will also support and encourage all societal efforts to\nrestore the traditional respect and regard for the elders.\n\n3. A person who retires after long years of service does not,\nby the very act of retiring, lose his ability to contribute\nin his field of expertise. Our Government will prepare a\ndecentralized database of such skilled and knowledgeable\nindividuals, so that both Governmental and non-\ngovernmental agencies can use their services.\n\n4. Organizations of senior citizens will be encouraged to\nparticipate in consultative, advisory and, wherever possible,\nmanagerial capacities in the implementation of suitable\nGovernmental programmes.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 220 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM\n\f\nOur Policy on Environment\nEcological Security for Sustainable Development\n\nTHE BJP believes in the traditional Indian position that Nature\nis sacred. The Atharva Veda sets out the principle that Nature is\nthe mother of humans and that humans owe a responsibility to\nmaintain the ecological balance. The BJP will ensure institutional\nmeasures to bring about ecological security so that all developmental\nprogrammes are in conformity with the principles of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nIt is essential to ensure production with lower inputs of energy,\nwater, chemicals and at lower costs. This will call for significant\nscientific research, new technologies and implementation strategies.\nTo deal with these critical problems, the BJP Government will:\n1. Introduce a National Environment Policy incorporating\na healthy balance between development needs and\npreservation of natural resources. The interests of States\nand consultation with them will be fully ensured. To\nimplement the policy, the Ministry of Environment and\nForests will be recast as the Ministry for Ecological Security;\n\n2. Formulate a programme for developing sustainable cities\nwith special emphasis on urban planning, safe drinking\nwater, waste management and lowering the use of natural\nresources like water through recycling and reduced usage\nintensity.\n\n3. Implement better management and harnessing of river\n\nwaters as well as sources of ground water;\n\n4. Control land, air and water pollution by industry and\n\nurban centres. Municipal sewage treatment plants will\nbe made obligatory;\n\nUntitled-10 221 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM\n\f\n222 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n5. Revive the faith of the people that Nature is sacred and make\nenvironment studies part of school, college and university\ncurricula. Also, make environment issues an integral part\nof the visual media so that our children develop a caring\nand protective attitude towards the ecological system that\nsustains our lives;\n\n6. Protect the traditional and other rights of Vanvasis and\nGirijans over forest resources and produce;\n\n7. Involve local Self-governments at all levels (panchayats,\nnagar palikas and zila parishads) both in villages and\ncities, in implementing the National Policy;\n\n8. Provide easy access to information on conservation and\nsustainable use of natural resources;\n\n9. Ban the import of hazardous chemical wastes for recycling\nby any industry or for dumping;\n\n10. Minimize the use of non-biodegradable material for\npackaging by the consumer non-durable products industry;\n\n11. Restrain the conversion of forests or grazing areas for\nother purposes;\n\n12. Adopt afforestation policies to be fulfilled within a\ngiven time frame and prevent the degradation of forest\nby natural or manmade causes. The cornerstone of the\nBJP\u2019s forest policy will be a part of the total framework\nof land management, adoption of a dynamic programme\nof productive forestry and moving to private investment\nin forestry from total State management of forests. A\nprogramme will also be drawn up for conversion of\ndegraded forests, wasteland and marginal land into quality\nforests;\n\n13. Deny exploitation of offshore resources, especially marine\nlife, by big trawlers;\n\n14. Promote research and development in environment-related\nissues and eco-technology for application in agriculture,\nindustry and the services sector;\n\n15. Provide incentives to manufacturers of eco-friendly\nproducts;\n\n16. Not sanction tourism-related projects that disturb the\nenvironment and cause degradation;\n\n17.

The BJP is proud of the achievement and capabilities,\nscientific and technological community of the country. The BJP\nendorses the basic philosophy outlined in the Scientific Policy\nResolution of 1958 and the Technology Policy Statement of 1983.\nThe BJP will increase public outlays on scientific research; and also\nensure that the potential of science and technology to improve the\nlot of vast sections of our society living below the poverty line and\nto bring about a more equitable society is fully harnessed. The BJP\nis committed to the urgent need to ensure integration of efforts\nin science and technology with the development programmes in\nthe various socio-economic sectors. The BJP recognizes that while\nscience and technology has a very important role to play in the\ncreation of wealth and improving the material conditions of the\nsociety, it is also a vital component in enriching the mind, enlarging\nthe human spirit and creating a thinking society. Towards this end,\nthe BJP Government will:\n\n1. Foster scientific mind and attitude among the people, using\nall the available powerful techniques of the mass media\nand in the various languages of the country; and support\nlocally-funded non-governmental organizations in their\nefforts in this regard;\n\n2. Ensure the use of science and technology in all important\ndevelopmental sectors for increasing production and\nproductivity, efficiency and for generating employment;\n\nUntitled-10 224 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 225\n\n3. Simplify administrative and financial procedures for\nefficient functioning of scientific institutions;\n\n4. Implement a vigorous programme to enrich science and\ntechnology subjects at all levels of education;\n\n5. Provide capital grants on a selective basis to restore\nuniversity-and national laboratory infrastructures,\nparticularly to replace obsolescent research and teaching\nequipment;\n\n6. Halt the decline in funding of civil research and\ndevelopment and prepare a national budget for public and\nprivate-sector investment in research and development so\nas to increase the outlay on R&D;\n\n7. Introduce effective measures to stimulate a substantial\nincrease in private investment in industrial research and\ndevelopment and innovation; and assist in raising capital\nfor start-up and growth;\n\n8. Provide incentives for formation of regional/local\ncollaborative networks including \u2018Technology Parks\u2019\nand for strong linkages involving universities, national\nlaboratories and industry in research and development;\n\n9. Ensure the creation of a network of centres for application\nof science and technology in rural areas, particularly,\nfor implementation of \u2018lab-to-land\u2019 programmes and to\ndevelop a strong low-cost agro-industrial base with focus\non decentralized employment;\n\n10. Create conducive work environment and facilities to\nretain the best scientists in the country and enthuse young\nscientists to pursue science as a career;\n\n11. Safeguard national interests and our intellectual\ndevelopment, strengthening the innovation base,\ndeveloping patents awareness and related infrastructure;\n\n12. Support and accelerate research in high priority areas\nof basic research as well as in underpinning enabling\ntechnological areas such as informatics, new materials\nand biotechnology;\n\n13.

Provide fullest support so that India can be at contemporary\nleadership level, in carefully selected areas, particularly\nwhere it has advantages and where outstanding individuals,\ngroups and institutions exist;\n\n15. Strengthen mechanisms for increased, meaningful and\nrelevant interaction with the global scientific community.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 226 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM\n\f\nOur Policy on Information Technology\nMaking India a Software Superpower\n\nRECENT advances in Information Technology (IT) have enshrined\nIT as the most revolutionary tool ever created in known human\nhistory. IT promises to transform every facet of human life and\nusher in a knowledge-based society in the next century. It has\nalready been delivering on some of these promises. The world\nof computers, telecommunication, television, the Internet and all\nother media is converging very rapidly, shrinking, in the process,\nPlanet Earth into a Global Village. This has opened up infinite and\npreviously unimaginable new possibilities in work, education,\ncommunication, commerce, manufacturing, agriculture, services,\nhealth-care, leisure and entertainment. It will influence the working\nof our political and democratic institutions, too.\n\nAlthough India lagged behind in the earlier phases of the\nIndustrial Revolution due to historical reasons, she has served notice\nof soon emerging as a major global IT power. Indian computer\nscientists and professionals \u2014 both those serving in India and abroad\n\u2014 have shown with their achievements that they have the potential\nto make our country a front-runner in the age of Information\nRevolution. The BJP attaches a high priority for accelerating this\nprocess. Specifically, we will do the following:\n\n1. Unveil a National Informatics Policy with a strategic 10-\nyear perspective to fully harness the benefits of IT in every\nsphere of our national life;\n\n2. Create awareness that IT is not a luxury, but the very\nbackbone of future development;\n\n3. The biggest contribution computers and the Internet can\nmake is in the field of education. Our IT policy shall strive\nto take India towards the goal of universal computer literacy\nand Internet access in the shortest possible period;\n\nUntitled-10 227 11/7/2016 11:19:35 PM\n\f\n228 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n4. Make India a software superpower by giving all-out\nencouragement to software companies to grab a large\nshare of the global market. Our aim is to have software\nexports increase by ten times in the next five years;\n\n5. The BJP will endeavour to provide, by the year 2000,\ncomputers and facilities for computer education in all\nsecondary schools in the country, including those in rural\nand remote areas, which otherwise have basic facilities\nlike a proper building and power;\n\n6. Formulate a bouquet of policy initiatives to support,\nwithin a competitive environment, Indian IT companies\nand professionals to rapidly expand the scale of their\noperations and to enable them to take the Indian IT flag\nall across the globe;\n\n7. Provide broad-band nationwide communication links using\nsatellites, optical fiber-cables and wireless. No region will\nbe without this essential IT infrastructure;\n\n8. Ensure the fast nationwide onset of the Internet, Intranet\nand Extranet as part of the global and national information\nsuperhighways. These will be evolved to carry mail,\nfinance and banking, electronic commerce and all other\nmultimedia communication needs in the shortest possible\ntime at the least cost;\n\n9. Quickly collect, compile and reformat all official records,\nespecially those which have a direct bearing on the\ncountry\u2019s economic progress and the average citizen's\ninteraction with Governmental agencies, into a usable\nelectronic format;\n\n10. Network, through the Internet, Intranet, Extranet, local\narea networks and wide area networks, all limbs of\nthe Government to facilitate quick, multiway flow of\ninformation amongst ministries, departments and key\nadministrative functionaries. This will help the Government\nwork faster, more efficiently and in a more pro-people\nmanner; and,\n\n11. Facilitate our schools, colleges and universities, in all\npossible ways, to harness the rich knowledge resources\navailable on the Internet to improve the standard o\neducation.\n\n \n\noO\n\nUntitled-10 228 11/7/2016 11:19:35 PM\n\f\nOur Policy on Media, Cinema, Arts\nFreedom with Responsibility\n\nWHILE the BJP believes in the traditional Indian position of Ano\nBhadraha Kritavayo Yantu Vishwataha (Let noble thoughts come to\nus from all sides), it equally believes in the Gandhian dictum that\nwe should keep our windows open for fresh air to come in, but\nkeep the walls intact, so that we are not blown off our feet. This\nis the guiding principle of the BJP in its approach to the media.\n\nConsistent with this, the BJP would enact rules to ensure that\nownership of the media is in the hands of natural-born Indians only.\nWhile, a limited extent of 20 per cent foreign equity investment\nmay be allowed in the electronic media in view of its large capital\nrequirements, no investment will be allowed in the other media,\nincluding the print media. On the use of editorial matter from\noutside in electronic media, the BJP would ensue that the safeguards\npresent in Article 19 (2. of the Constitution are fully implemented\nto balance freedoms and public interest.\n\nVoluntary Normative Standards for Media\n\nTHE BJP believes that, a healthy polity and democracy cannot\nsurvive without the support of an extra-political moral order\nwhich the democratic political order cannot itself impose on its\ncitizens. This belief is also the emerging belief of more advanced\ndemocracies that are experiencing a steep slide in morality which\nis endangering the very idea of orderly society. These decaying\nsocieties are beginning to understand that no society, especially a\ndemocracy, can long endure without the consensus of the majority of\nits citizens to some normative moral code. Within the boundaries of\nthis code, cultural diversity can flourish, outside of which it quickly\n\nUntitled-10 229 11/7/2016 11:19:35 PM\n\f\n230 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\ndegenerates into a jungle of conflicting special interests enveloped\nin moral chaos.\n\nWhile the world shrinks, India will have to provide against\nsuch danger in our society too. Fortunately, at the family and social\nlevels, the age-old \u2018dharma\u2019, which is distinct from religious practice,\nacts as an extra-political normative moral order. But the normative\nmoral order or dharma needs to be protected and preserved as it is\nalready under pressure. With this end in view, the BJP will strive\nfor a national consensus with the involvement of all sections of\nthe Indian society for a voluntary moral standard for the media,\nfor the media plays a very important role both in fostering and\nprejudicing such a moral order. The inherent idea behind such a\nmoral code may be summarized as under:\n\n1. Promotion of family values and extended family\nrelationships to preserve its character as a basic socio-\neconomic and socio-cultural unit.\n\n2. The importance of religious faith in moulding human life,\nwith due understanding that religions should not conflict;\nnor should there be uniformity.\n\n3. Projection of regard and respect for women and\nmotherhood.\n\n4. Criticism of political parties and personalities, without\neroding the self-confidence of the nation.\n\n5. Promotion of interest in Indian traditions, history, literature,\narts and values as a source of emotional support and as a link\nwith the nation\u2019s past, thus strengthening the civilizational\nand cultural roots of the country and its people.\n\n6. Entertainment as an embodiment of the traditional Indian\nview of \u2018Navarasa\u2019 so that it does not degenerate into a\nsource of amoral living.\n\n7. Healthy development of an open and scientific mind, the\nspirit of adventure and patriotism among the youth.\n\nThe BJP will ensure that the rights of free speech of Indian\ncitizens are guaranteed and will promote the availability throughout\nIndia of a diverse range of radio and television services offering\ninformation, entertainment and education. A BJP Government\nwill ensure the development of a non-partisan Indian expression\nthrough programmes which, while reflecting Indian attitudes,\nopinions, ideas, values and artistic creativity would, at the same\n\nUntitled-10 230 11/7/2016 11:19:35 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 231\n\ntime, encourage rational thinking, a scientific temper and lead\nIndian society to modernity in the 21st century.\n\nThis is an indicative and not exhaustive idea on the subject.\nThe BJP Government will start a nationwide debate on this\nconcept of a voluntary moral code and strive to evolve a\nconsensus.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we will:\n\n1. Improve the provisions of the Prasar Bharati Act to let\nPrasar Bharati organize an effective public broadcasting\nsystem, which would be accountable to Parliament but free\nfrom Government control, immune from political influence\nand sensitive to the diverse needs of Indian society.\n\n2. While permitting, by license, the entry of private enterprise\nand investment in radio and television broadcasting, purely\non commercially acceptable terms determined by bids, we\nwill ensure that:\n\n(a) The uplinking of television programmes will be from\nIndia.\n\n(b) Foreign equity investment in audio-visual media is\nrestricted to 20 per cent.\n\n(c) Management of all types of the media is in Indian\nhands.\n\n3. Ensure, by law, that there are appropriate statutory\nguidelines for the content of the broadcast in line with\nthe terms of Article 19 (2. of the Constitution of India.\n\n4. Ensure and encourage the availability of a variety and\nplurality of views and diversity in programming by\ndiscouraging monopolies and maximizing the number of\nvoices, which can use the mass media. We will, therefore,\nimpose appropriate cross-media and cross-platform\nrestrictions and also restriction on investment by media\nin cable-TV companies and vice-versa.\n\n5. Facilitate the development of an efficient and competitive\nIndian broadcasting industry by providing a level playing\nfield to the nascent Indian industry vis-a-vis a highly\ndeveloped foreign-based broadcasting industry.\n\n6. Encourage providers of both public and commercial\nbroadcasting services to be responsive to the need for\nfair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest\n\nUntitled-10 231 11/7/2016 11:19:35 PM\n\f\n232 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nincluding matters of local significance and respect\ncommunity standards in the provision of programming.\n\n7. Ensure the providers of broadcasting services place a high\npriority on the protection of children from exposure to\nprogrammes that may be harmful to them.\n\n8. Ensure the adaptability of the Indian broadcasting system\nto scientific and technological change.\n\n9. Create an exclusive \u2018Kisan Channel\u2019 in Doordarshan.\n\n10. Establish an independent autonomous public authority\ncomprising representatives of all sections and interests.\nThis authority will regulate broadcasting and set up a\nsystem to address complaints.\n\n11. Evolve a strategic plan to strengthen India\u2019s national news\nagencies like PTI and UNI to let them become influential\nglobal players in the shortest time.\n\n12. Economic security and social welfare of working journalists\nshall be ensured. The Working Journalists Act, 1955 shall\nbe further strengthened and steps shall be taken for proper\nimplementation in all media establishments.\n\n13. Freedom of the Press shall be ensured and protected at all\ncosts.\n\nCinema\n\nPOPULAR cinema has played an important role in promoting\nsocial harmony and nationalism, apart from providing inexpensive\nentertainment to the masses. However, in recent years, popular\ncinema, increasingly funded by the underworld, has had a negative\nimpact on society, especially on impressionable young minds. Sex\nand violence on the screen are beginning to gnaw at the moorings\nof our cultural ethos. The BJP is committed to checking this abuse\nof popular cinema. A BJP Government will:\n\n1. Allow movie-makers through suitable provisions in law\nto raise resources from financial institutions to curb the\ninfluence of underworld financiers and Mafia dons.\n\n2. We will provide a \u2018green channel\u2019 clearance for the\nautomatic certification of movies that do not have explicit\nscenes and dialogues of violence and sex. Producers of\nsuch movies will not have to wait in the queue for Censor\nBoard clearance.

Exempt quality movies, which will be certified \u2018Q\u2019, from\nentertainment tax.\n\n4. Encourage viewers to form local Darshak Sanghs \u2014 on the\nlines of consumer organizations \u2014to monitor the quality\nof movies being screened in their area.\n\n5. Set up theaters at all district headquarters and large\npopulation centres for screening art and popular movies.\n\n6. Reserve 50 per cent of the places on the Censor Board and\nCensor Panels for women.\n\n7. Create a special fund for promoting regional cinema.\n\n8. Introduce legislation to ensure minimum wages and\nretirement benefits for movie artistes and crew.\n\nIn the field of performing and literary arts, our broad approach\nwill be:\n1. Preservation, propagation and popularization of our\ndiverse cultural heritage.\n2. Creativity and experimentation.\nNational integration through arts.\n4. Taking arts to the people and bringing people\u2019s arts to\nnational limelight.\n5. Recognition and honour of and support to outstanding\n\n\u00bb\n\npersons in creative pursuits.\n\n6.

We have pursued pro-people policies, implemented\nprogrammes that have benefited millions of lives and, above all,\nmaintained peace and communal amity. Peace and prosperity for\nall has been the hallmark of our State Governments in Rajasthan,\nUttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra (where we share power with\nthe Shiv Sena), Punjab (where we share power with the Akali Dal)\nand Haryana (where we share power with the Haryana Vikas\nParishad). In Uttar Pradesh, although the BJP has been in power\nfor a few months now, far-reaching decisions have been taken and\naction initiated to restore rule of law in a State that had come to\nrepresent \u2018jungle raj\u2019 during prolonged Central rule. Attempts have\nbeen made by our adversaries to destabilize these Governments,\nbut they have failed.\n\nWith a firm, but fair hand our State Governments have\ncracked down on criminal and anti-national activities. The\ncriminal-politician-bureaucrat nexus that had emerged during\nCongress rule in these States has been smashed. In Maharashtra,\nthe underworld mafia has been put on the run. Our Governments\nhave attached significant attention to maintaining law and order,\nwhich has contributed to the economic well-being of the masses.\nComplaints of corruption have been vigorously followed up with\nimpartial inquiries. Prompt action was taken wherever it was called\nfor without fear or favor.\n\nSpecial attention has also been paid to the problems of farmers\n\nUntitled-10 234 11/7/2016 11:19:35 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 235\n\nand socially disadvantaged sections of society.

All efforts have been made to mobilize\nresources for development without burdening the people with\nfresh taxes. Infrastructure and job-generating industry have been\nthe focus of our attention.\n\nWe are proud to list some of the salient achievements of our\nState Governments.\n\nRajasthan\n\n1.

The Council also articulates,\nfrom time to time, the aspirations of the States vis-a-vis the Centre.\nIt has played a major role in formulating fiscal demands of the\nStates and in seeking to resolve problems plaguing Centre-State\nrelations. The Council has formally met thrice-in Gandhinagar,\nMumbai and in Jaipur. After each meeting, a document has been\nreleased, listing areas of commonality, programmes of action and\nsuggested measures for the Union Government for harmonious\nrelations with the State Governments.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 239 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\nTowards a New Culture of National\nConsensus and Responsible Citizenry\n\nCONSENSUS-building is an essential part of nation-building.\nCooperation for the larger good of the nation has been a cornerstone\nof our civilization. Yet, one of the many baneful contributions of\nthe Congress Party to India\u2019s post-Independence polity has been\nthe politics of confrontation and negativism. The BJP believes\nthat, in a multi-party democracy like ours, constructive dialogue,\nconsultation and cooperation between the ruling and opposition\nparties is, not only desirable, but essential. It has become all the\nmore necessary since several major national issues confronting\nIndia today cannot be effectively addressed without evolving a\nbroad platform of national consensus.\n\nSome of the issues where such a national consensus is most\nurgently called for are: electoral reforms; Centre-State relations;\npopulation policy; empowerment of women by legislating 33 per\ncent reservation for them in all elected bodies; inter-state water\ndisputes; environmental protection; and effective institutional\nguarantees for the welfare of the weaker sections of society in the\ncourse of economic reforms.\n\nSpecifically, our Party and Government shall do the following:\n\n1. We shall not practice \u2018political untouchability\u2019 vis-a-vis\nany party;\n\n2. In all issues of national importance where a national\nconsensus is needed, we shall adopt a policy of dialogue\nand consultation with other political parties;\n\n3. The consultative mechanisms and procedures in Parliament,\ntowards which the Congress Party always had a casual or\ncontemptuous attitude, will be revived; and,\n\nUntitled-10 240 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 241\n\n4. We shall actively seek the views, suggestions and, wherever\nfeasible, participation of citizens and organizations outside\nthe sphere of politics.\n\nAn equally important dimension of democracy and nation-\nbuilding, which the Congress Party totally neglected in the past five\ndecades, is the need to build a responsible citizenry. Democracy is\nnot only about rights, but also about responsibilities and duties.\nHowever, since the rulers themselves threw their responsibilities to\nthe winds and turned Statecraft into crass commerce and politics into\nan unscrupulous power game, the average Indian naturally became\ncynical about politics. His awareness about his responsibilities as\na citizen weakened and, to that extent, his conscious contribution\nto nation-building also diminished.\n\nAs the adage Raja kaalasya kaaranam (The ruler is responsible\nfor the times) reminds us, the blame for this sad of State of affairs\nrests with the Raja and not the Praja. The BJP pledges that, when it\nis in power, the people will see a qualitative change in the culture\nof governance. There will be a marked change in the mindset and\nbehavior of those in Government. Their duties and responsibilities\nwill take precedence over their perquisites.\n\nThough such a change in the culture and content of governance\nis the first prerequisite for building a New India, it alone is not\nenough. A change in the mindset and behavior of citizens in their\ndaily lives is also equally necessary for building a strong, prosperous\nand proud nation. On the occasion of the Swarna Jayanti of our\nIndependence, therefore, the BJP makes the following appeal to\nevery Indian to inculcate the spirit of the Freedom Movement:\n\n1. \u2018We, the people of India, shall not discriminate on the\nbasis of caste, creed, class, gender, language, or region in\nany of our actions and decisions in life. Instead, we shall\nbehave with all our compatriots in the belief that we all\nare equal children of Bharat Mata.\u2019\n\n2. \u2018We, the people of India, whichever profession or vocation\nwe are in, shall work with honesty, dedication and\ndiscipline in the spirit of a New Work Culture.\u2019\n\n3. \u2018We, the people of India, shall always give priority to\nour patriotic duties and responsibilities over narrow self-\ninterest, even as we zealously strive for the realization o\nour rights enshrined in the Constitution.\u2019\n\n \n\noO\n\nUntitled-10 241 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\nThe BJP\u2019s Appeal to Dear Countrymen\n\nTO translate this manifesto into reality, we appeal to our all\ncompatriots to vote for the BJP and its allies to power in the elections\nto the 12th Lok Sabha. A moment comes when the right choice can\nchange the course of a nation\u2019s history. This is the moment to make\na decisive choice between the BJP and a decrepit, morally bankrupt\nCongress; between the BJP and opportunist parties that have no\nideological conviction like the Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party;\nand between the BJP and the Communist parties who have a hideous\nhistory of betrayal of the national interest at every crucial juncture.\nIn the coming election:\n\u00a2 The choice is between stability and another mid-term\nelection soon.\n\u00a2 The choice is between an able Prime Minister and prime\nministerial pretenders.\n\u00a2 The choice is between a Government that will change the\nlife of every Indian for the better or one that will make a\nbad condition still worse.\n\u00a2 The choice is between nationalism and a Foreign Hand.\nThe BJP gives a solemn assurance to the people of India: \u2018We\nshall sincerely strive to fulfill all the commitments set out in the\nmanifesto. If the BJP is voted to power, the India that enters the 21st\ncentury and the next millennium, will be an India that will hold her\nhead high and whose citizens will be enjoying the long-awaited\nfruits of progress made possible by a Government committed to\nSu-raj (good governance). Guided by a 10-year perspective, our\nGovernment will aim to achieve what others could not in the last\nfifty years. Our victory will be people\u2019s victory. It will be the victory\nof Bharat Mata.\u2019\nOo\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 242 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\nBJP\u2019s 10-Point Freedom Charter\n\nWe'll do in 10 years what others couldn\u2019t in 50.\n1.

Centuries\u2019 old hopes and\naspirations of our people yearn for a true expression. The destiny\nof our land and its people cries for fulfilment. At such crucial turns\nhistorical choices are made and instruments of change adopted.\nThat destined vehicle of change is the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nNever before in the long history of our land has the country\nbeen governed by such a morally rudderless and financially corrupt\nregime. Seldom have our trusting people been duped by a baser\nband. With the people\u2019s hopes belied and their aspirations thwarted,\nour ancient land stands today face to face with the option of a\nreal change, a chance for a true departure from the last 50 years\nof Congress misrule, an alternative and an option: The Bharatiya\nJanata Party.\n\nOur people are looking towards the BJP to become just this\ninstrument of change. The party is ready to shoulder this great\nduty and responsibility. The task is nothing short of rekindling\nthe lamp of our eternal \u2018Dharma\u2019, that Sanatan thought which\n\nour sages bequeathed to mankind \u2014 a social system based\non compassion, cooperation, justice, freedom, equality and\ntolerance.\n\nTo reallse this goal, the BJP will launch a new social, economic\n\nUntitled-10 247 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\n248 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nand political order. It will strive to transform the existing system of\ngovernance, to make it responsive and answerable to the concerns\nof our citizens. It will strive to make the economy cater to the\nlargest demands of the largest number. The party will endeavour\nto place in the service of the nation a political organisation that is\nconscientious and clean. Above all, the BJP will secure for India\na place in the comity of nations which befits its vast cultural,\nintellectual, economic, scientific and human wealth.\n\nWe realise that correcting the mistakes of the last 50 years of\nCongress misrule, of piecing together the shattered dreams of our\ncitizens, of restructuring our polity which has been delivered a body\nblow by the present regime, of restoring 10 the state\u2019s authority and\nreviving faith in the Government, is by no means an easy task. But\nwe also realise that only the BJP has the ideological commitment,\nmoral conviction and political courage to shoulder this task and\ngently guide our nation into the next millennium. The present\nmillennium began with the subjugation of our ancient land; let\na reinvigorated, proud, prosperous and strong India herald the\nnext millennium.\n\nIn this noble mission, we shall be guided by our Manifesto \u2014 it\ncontains our commitments to the nation and its citizens. Our state\ngovernments in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,\nMaharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi have demonstrated\nthat for the BJP, these commitments constitute a sacred covenant\nwith the people. We do what we say. This Manifesto shall be the\ncovenant of our government.\n\nWith a BJP Government at the Centre, the next five years\nwill be devoted to implementing our Manifesto based on the\nfour concepts of Suraksha, Shuchita, Swadeshi and Samrasata.\nHindutva, or cultural nationalism, shall be the rainbow which\nwill bridge our present to our glorious past and pave the way\nfor an equally glorious future; it will guide the transition from\nSwarajya to Surajya. Our Manifesto reflects the application\nof these four concepts in good governance and their role in\nmoulding the nation we dreamt of on the dawn of Independence\n\u2014 a prosperous and strong India, a country where every citizen\nregards this land of ours, this Bharatbhoomi, that stretches from\n\nUntitled-10 248 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 249\n\nthe Indus to the seas, as his sacred motherland.\n\nThe BJP believes in one nation, one people, and one culture.\nWe are, therefore, committed to promoting social reconciliation\nrather than conflict. We are resolved to put an end to the politics of\ncompetitive communalism, of appeasement, and of casteism. The\npolitics of pitting caste against caste, community against community\nand class against class has torn asunder our social fabric. The BJP\nwill reweave this fabric into a harmonious pattern.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 249 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\nOur Nation, Our State,\nOur Government\n\nA New Direction, A New Dispensation.\n\nNearly half a century of Congress misrule has all but shattered the\ninternal polity of the country. There is not one institution of the\nRepublic left that can be said to now be in a state of total health.\nThe Legislature, the Executive, unfortunately the Judiciary, and\neven the media have been afflicted by the mindlessness of the\nCongress\u2019 exploitation and loot of our country.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party well recognises that to correct\nthis great wrong of the past five decades requires the skill and\ncommitment of a Vishwakarma. With humility, we address ourselves\nto this task.\n\nThe first is to restore to our state its authority. Perhaps never\nsince the scourge of the Pindaries has the writ of our state been as\nenfeebled as by this Congress misrule. The primary task, therefore,\nis to restore to the state, and to governance, its honour and its\nprestige \u2014 izzat and iqbal. For this the BJP will institute a set of\nmeasures. This is a challenge that is principally moral and only\nthen functional. The BJP commits itself, therefore, to:\n\n1. Addressing purposefully to the many challenges being\n\nposed to us in Jammu & Kashmir and in the North-East of\nIndia. We are of the view that in both these strategically\nimportant border regions of the country, misgovernance,\nneglect and emotional separation from India lie at the root\nof the problems. Terrorism and challenges to the state will\nbe met forthrightly; changes in law where warranted will\nbe brought about expeditiously; the approach will be firm\nbut always fair.\n\nUntitled-10 250 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 251\n\nTo translate this Manifesto into reality, to fulfil our destined\nrole of leading India into the next millennium, the Bharatiya\nJanata Party seeks the support and cooperation of all our\ncitizens.\n\n2. Launching a major nationwide drive to identify influx\nof illicit arms and their possession. Proliferation of small\narms affects directly the law and order in the country as\nalso the security of the nation. We recognise that narcotics\nsmuggling and narco-terrorism are linked. The country\nmust be rid of both. The law in this regard will be made\nmore effective and implemented.\n\n3. Toning up the administration (as enumerated subsequently)\nand reforming its functioning, accountability and\nresponsibilities.\n\n4. Rationalising the number, structure, composition and role\nof paramilitary forces, including recent initiatives like\nNational Security Guard (NSG), Rapid Action Force (RAF)\nand Special Protection Group (SPG). We will review the\npersonal security arrangments: We believe that the security\nof the high dignitaries of the country is the responsibility\nof the state. This security, however, should neither be\nexaggerated nor intrusive. It should not ever be at the cost\nof the collective convenience of the citizens of the country.\nThe BJP will reform this.\n\nAn Agenda for Change\nConstitutional Reforms\nThe BJP believes that Centre-State relations, which have been\nona downslide for the past 50 years, need to be improved. We also\nbelieve that reforms are needed for a stronger Union and equal\nrights for all citizens.\n1. The BJP will implement the main recommendations of the\nSarkaria Commission, such as:\n(a) Restoring the balance of resources in favour of the\nStates;\n(b) Ending the misuse of Art 356 to dismiss state\ngovernments and dissolve state assemblies. We will\nexplore the possibility of making it mandatory for the\n\nUntitled-10 251 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\n252 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nUnion Government to seek Parliament\u2019s approval by\ntwo-thirds majority for dismissal of state governments\nand,\n\n(c) Consulting state governments before appointing\nGovernors.\n\n2. We promise to carve out Uttaranchal, Vananchal, Vidarbha\nand Chhattisgarh and give them full statehood. We will\nfurther consider setting up a commission to examine\nthe formation of smaller states. Delhi will be given full\nstatehood.\n\n3. The BJP will provide Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh in J&K\nstate with regional development councils.\n\n4. We will abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, which puts\nJammu & Kashmir on a separate and separatist pedestal,\nfor the state\u2019s full and final integration with the Union.\n\n5. We will set up an inter-state council under Article 263 of\nthe Constitution to settle all inter-state and Centre-State\ndisputes to avoid ad hoc responses to issues like that of\nCauvery waters.\n\n6. The BJP is committed to Article 44 of the Constitution. We\nwill adopt a Uniform Civil Code which will be applicable to\nevery community and foster a common Bharatiya identity,\napart from ensuring gender equality. Regressive personal\nlaws will cease to have legal validity.\n\n7. The manner of appointment of constitutional functionaries\nwill be reviewed.\n\n8. We will maintain a national register of citizens and\nintroduce a multipurpose identity card.\n\nElectoral Reforms\n\nThe BJP carries a conviction that amongst the many causes\nthat have brought the state of our polity to its present plight, a\nmajor factor is faulty elections. We will, therefore, immediately\non assuming office, implement various electoral reforms. For free,\nfair and fearless elections, the BJP will:\n\n1. Update and adopt the Goswami Committee report;\n\n2. Grant statutory status to the Code of Conduct drawn up\n\nUntitled-10 252 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 253\n\nby the Election Commission and give it teeth;\n\n3. Introduce a scheme of state-funding of candidates to all\nlegislatures;\n\n4. Provide suitable incentives for open, official corporate\nfunding to all recognised political parties;\n\n5. Undertake fresh delimitation of Lok Sabha and Assembly\nconstituencies on the basis of the 1991 census;\n\n6. Make it mandatory for political parties to submit audited\naccounts for public scrutiny annually;\n\n7. Examine the feasibility of introducing the list system;\n\n8. Expedite the process of issuing identity cards to all voters\nand make it a mandatory requirement for voting;\n\n9. Scrutinise all voters\u2019 lists to ensure that no legitimate voter\nis excluded;\n\n10. Take steps to curb expenditure on elections by imposing\na ban on advertisements, cutouts, etc;\n\n11. Introduce electronic voting machines to hasten the process\nof counting;\n\n12. Examine the possibility of simultaneous elections to the\nParliament, State Assemblies and Panchayats;\n\n13. Ensure speedy and exemplary punishment for those who\nindulge in booth-capturing;\n\n14. Officials found guilty of involvement in poll rigging will\nbe given exemplary punishment;\n\n15. Amend the anti-defection law whereby a member of\nany Legislature who changes parties will lose his or her\nmembership of the House; and,\n\n16. Prevent the misuse of Doordarshan and A.LR. by the ruling\n\nparty.\n\nCorruption & Its Cure\n\nThe BJP treats this affliction as the single greatest wrong that\nthe Congress misrule of the past 50 years has brought about on\nour land. The corruption that now corrodes our country is of the\nspirit, it is moral, and it is also financial. The challenge thus to\ngovernance is principally of setting an example \u2014 of impeccable\nprobity and unimpeachable accountability of all public men and\nwomen. This must not cover simply the elected representatives\n\nUntitled-10 253 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\n254 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nof the people but also the executive, the police and, indeed, even\nthe judiciary, where the touch of corruption can easily be felt.\nThe BJP will address itself to this challenge and task, by adopting\nmeasures that are mentioned here. We do not claim that this is\neither the ultimate blueprint for the reduction of corruption or the\nlast word on it. It is an expression of our commitment; a first step\nto setting right a very great wrong of many years\u2019 malignancy; a\nbeginning and that, too, with ourselves. For a clean public life in\nwhich morality and ethics find due recognition, the BJP will:\n\n1. Make it obligatory on every elected representative to\nmake, public his entire income and wealth within 90 days\nof election;\n\n2. Introduce extensive regulations and requirements upon\nthose who hold public office so that no conflict of interest\nis ever permitted to influence a proper discharge of their\nduties;\n\n3. Appoint a Lok Pal to entertain complaints of corruption\nagainst anybody holding public office, including the Prime\nMinister;\n\n4. Take measures to modify and reform the methodology\nof government approval for contracts, schemes and\nlarge money value agreements so as to make them more\ntransparent. The powers of patronage, the right to say\n\u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 to simple daily requirements of the citizens\nwill be reduced drastically. A government that intrudes\nthe least, we hold, governs the best. We will endeavour\nto combine this with open and transparent governance;\n\n5. Expeditiously deal with cases of corruption unresolved\nand in which no action has been taken in the past 10 years;\n\n6. Take steps to ensure that investigative and intelligence\nagencies like RAW, IB and CBI are not used to subserve\nthe political designs of the ruling party.\n\nJudicial Reforms\nFor speedy, fair and inexpensive justice, the BJP will:\n1. Appoint special judges to clear the huge arrears at all\nlevels of the judiciary;\n2. Fill the vacancies in the High Courts and the Supreme\n\nUntitled-10 254 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 255\n\nCourt without any further delay;\n\n3. Legislate to the effect that courts do not give unending\nadjournments and complete cases within one year.\n\n4. Constantly review the salaries and pension benefits of all\njudges so as to attract the best legal talent to the judiciary;\n\n5. Expand and strengthen the existing legal aid facilities for\neconomically weaker sections of the society; and,\n\n6. Set up a National Judicial Commission which will be\nresponsible for making judicial appointments in the High\nCourts and the Supreme Court.\n\nPanchayati Raj\nFor better local self-governance at the village-level, the BJP will:\n1. In the light of recent experience, make changes in the\nConstitution 73rd and 74th amendments to further\nstrengthen the Panchayati Raj system; and,\n2. Endeavour to make the panchayats financially self-sufficient.\n\nAdministrative Reforms\n\nFor a caring, just and accountable administration, to provide\nhigh quality services the citizens value and for a new paradigm in\npublic administration, the BJP will:\n\n1. Make the district administration accountable for any\noutbreak of violence; institute a time-bound inquiry;\npublish the findings; punish the guilty; and, compensate\nthe victims;\n\n2. Update and implement the National Police Commission\nreport in a time-bound manner;\n\n3. Ask each Ministry /Department to set clear performance\nstandards, including cost consciousness, in quantifiable\nterms and monitor the adherence to these standards;\n\n4. Introduce a scheme of fixed minimum tenure for some\nidentified posts at higher ranks, e.g. Chief Secretaries,\nSecretaries to Government, DGPs, etc;\n\n5. Disfavour extensions to bureaucrats and police officers;\n\n6. Institute an annual Sardar Patel award for the best three\ndistrict officers, as a beginning;\n\n7. Ensure uniform housing and other related facilities for\n\nUntitled-10 255 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\n256 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nofficers in the same grade and in the same station. The\nsystem of allotment of houses will be made transparent;\n8. Introduce a system of allowing lateral entry of personnel\nfrom the private sector, NGOs, educational/research\ninstitutes into government;\n9. Identify areas from which government must withdraw so\nthat departments can be wound up ina phased manner;\n\n10. Strengthen the department of administrative reforms at\nthe Centre and in the States; and,\n\n11. Give the citizens what is their due. A huge divide today\nseparates the citizen, the society and the state. This is\nprincipally on account of the state not treating the rights\nof the citizens as sacrosanct; not fulfilling its obligations\ntowards the citizens sincerely; and, not providing to the\ncitizens the services that are its bounden duty. The BJP\nwill, therefore, identify such areas as warrant immediate\ncorrection, as they affect the daily life of the ordinary\ncitizen, and implement reforms in them within a given\ntimeframe.\n\nShri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya\n\nThe BJP is committed to the concept of one nation, one people,\none culture \u2014 our nationalist vision is not merely bound by the\ngeographical or political identity of India, but defined by our\nancient cultural heritage. From this belief flows our faith in \u2018Cultural\nNationalism\u2019 which is the core of Hindutva. That, we believe, is\nthe identity of our ancient nation \u2014 Bharatvarsha.\n\nHindutva is a unifying principle which alone can preserve\nthe unity and integrity of our nation. It is a collective endeavour\nto protect and re-energise the soul of India, to take us into the next\nmillennium as a strong and prosperous nation. Hindutva is also\nthe antidote to the shameful efforts of any section to benefit at the\nexpense of others.\n\nWe hold that only by recognising the limitless strength of\ncultural nationalism, can the nation be moulded. When the BJP\njoined the movement for the construction of the Shri Ram Mandir\nat Ayodhya, it was to strengthen just these foundations.\n\nOn coming to power, the BJP Government will facilitate the\n\nUntitled-10 256 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 257\n\nconstruction of a magnificent Shri Ram Mandir at Janmasthan in\nAyodhya which will be a tribute to Bharat Mata. This dream moves\nmillions of people in our land; the concept of Rama lies at the core\nof their consciousness.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 257 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\nOur Economy, Action And Direction\n\nEconomic Growth and Employment Through Swadeshi\n\nFour decades of Congress misrule have ruined the economic\ncreativity of our country; these decades failed to place the country\nona sound economic footing, befitting India\u2019s stature as the largest\ndemocracy in the world. The experiments of the Congress, with\nvastly divergent models, have brought the country, from time to\ntime, to the brink of crisis. The passive victim of all these experiments\nhas been the long suffering citizen of our country; even as under-\nnourishment, malnutrition, illiteracy and deprivation afflict a\nlarge percentage of them; even as the quality of life gets fractured\nbetween India and Bharat.\n\nWe commit ourselves to bringing certainty in economic policy.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party is proud of India\u2019s heritage and has\nan abiding faith in the creative genius of every Indian. We are\ncommitted to an economy that enables India to achieve its destiny\nin the forefront of the nations of the world.\n\nIn 1991, the present government claimed that it inherited an\neconomy which had a slender foreign exchange reserves. Accepting\nIMF conditionalities, it initiated a programme of deregulation of\nindustry, trade and exchange rate policies, a radically different\napproach to foreign investment. The consequential foreign\nexchange reserves that it will be leaving, as a legacy to the successor\ngovernment, are, however, fragile, being composed mainly of\nquick-sand components of foreign institutional investments and\nFCNR deposits. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is only a minor\ncomponent of them. An enormous $7 billion becomes ripe for debt\nservicing in 1996-97 itself. In its zeal to contain fiscal deficits task in\nwhich it failed, the fiscal deficit continuing around 7% of GDP \u2014it\n\nUntitled-10 258 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 259\n\npruned developmental expenditure beyond acceptable limits, in\nconsequence constraining growth.\n\nDespite the proclaimed deregulation, over the past five years,\nall earlier structures and institutions of the License Quota-Permit\nRaj remain intact. Social infrastructure has been neglected and the\nlot of the poor and deprived has further deteriorated. The country\u2019s\ndefence requirements were also neglected, thereby putting the\nnation\u2019s security in jeopardy.\n\nThe neglect of infrastructure by this government has left a\nlegacy of a fractured physical infrastructure \u2014roads, railways,\npost, power, telecom\u2014are grinding to near immobility, in the\nprocess constraining growth elsewhere in the economy. In\nits methodology for containing the budget through limits on\nmonetisation of the deficit, this government has compulsorily\nresorted to heavy borrowings, which in turn, has resulted in\nliquidity to the rest of the economy and a heating up of the\ninterest rates. Our domestic industry, starved of liquidity, is in\ndanger of slipping into recession.\n\nIn totality, this government will leave an economy more fragile\nand shattered than what it inherited in 1991. The challenges thus,\nto us in our bid at governance, are formidable.\n\nOur Economic Thought\n\nIn outlining our strategy, we recognise that the post Cold War\nworld has adopted the market place for fast economic growth.\nHowever, our thought is defined by the following:\n\n(i) Market may ensure growth, but it cannot ensure redistribute\nequity and justice. The state continues to have a role to\nplay;\n\n(ii) The poor and deprived have, therefore, to be helped by the\nstate to cross the poverty line and to attain a sustainable\nminimum quality of life;\n\n(iii) On the economic front, the old order, based on comparative\nadvantage of labour or resources, is giving way to a new\norder built on the basis of human resources, skills and\ntechnology. A proper policy can make it India\u2019s strength;\nand\n\n(iv) A society such as ours has to innovate its own strategy,\n\nUntitled-10 259 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\n260 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nto adapt to the high-tech challenges of a supposedly\nborderless world, without the attendant social stresses,\neconomic instability and the abandonment either of its\nidentity or of its own socio-cultural ethos. This is the essence\nof our Swadeshi approach: A self-reliant India, asserting\nits national economic interests, not as autarchy, but as a\npre-requisite to meeting the challenge of globalisation;\nof preserving our identity without compromising\nour sovereignty or self respect. We reject unbridled\nconsumerism and believe in adherence to sustainable\nconsumption and growth.\n\nForeign investment will be required and encouraged for world\nclass technology. But when foreign savings have to supplement and\nassist the economy in circumstances where domestic savings are\ninadequate, we compromise with the nation\u2019s long term interests.\nWhile many countries which started late but arrived much earlier\nthan India, managed their growth on savings levels around 35-40%\nof GDP, the Indian domestic savings rate has steadily declined to\na low level of 20% of GDP during Congress rule. This is grossly\ninadequate for even the current level of investment, let alone the\nlevels required for a faster growth of the economy. Not only have\nprivate savings declined, more worrisomely, governmental savings\nare now virtually nil.\n\nWe recognise two immediate priorities \u2014 first, providing the\nphysical and economic infrastructure that is appropriate for the\nstipulated growth in our GDP; second, providing the required social\ninfrastructure for a minimum sustainable quality of life.\n\nTo attain these and yet contain fiscal deficit requires a different\napproach. The BJP will work towards pruning non-developmental\nexpenditure; minimise the commercial activities of government;\nseverely cutting back on bureaucracy; shedding the structures of\ncontrols and regulation; and re-equipping itself for its new role\nof providing a framework for free market operations for growth,\naccentuating programmes for poverty eradication and social\nInfrastructure.\n\nUntitled-10 260 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 261\n\nFiscal Reform and Taxation\n\nWe believe that taxation alone cannot be the base for revenue.\nA stable and fast growth is possible only through a high order of\ninvestment matched by an appropriate level of domestic savings.\nThe present government has done a great disservice by encouraging\navoidable consumerism and diverting the depleted savings into\nspeculative rather than safe and productive channels.\n\n\u00a2 We will structure our fiscal reforms so that savings and\ncontracted savings are augmented to levels that will take\ncare of a higher order of investment needed for faster\ngrowth;\n\n\u00a2 In taxation, we will ensure that not only levels and rates\nof taxation are such that growth is not constrained, but\nthat the burden-sharing of taxes is equitably distributed\namong all affluent sections of society. We will mitigate\nthe undue rigours of indirect taxes \u2014 today indirect taxes\nconstitute 71 % of tax revenue \u2014so that productivity and\ngrowth are not hampered.\n\nWe will devise a suitably structured valued added tax (VAT)\nso as to ensure better burden-sharing among \u2018goods and services\u2019\nthat contribute to value addition.\n\n\u00a2 In tariffs we will ensure that the domestic sector gets a\nlevel playing field, and does not become uncompetitive;\n\n\u00a2 We will also strive to lighten the debt burden on the nation.\nThis in turn will contribute to interest rate stabilisation;\n\n\u00a2 We will not hike Excise Duties on items of mass\nconsumption;\n\n\u00a2 We will examine the aspect of sales tax reform and\nequalisation;\n\n\u00a2 We will ensure operational autonomy of the RBI;\n\n\u00a2 We will adopt firm measures to prevent the generation of\nblack money;\n\n\u00a2 We will rationalise and simplify the present tax structure\nand raise the Income Tax exemption limit to Rs. 60,000;\n\n\u00a2 We will provide weighted deductions taking number of\ndependents on earning member;\n\n\u00a2 We will exempt all investments in approved organisations,\nprivate OR public, from the levy of Wealth Tax;\n\nUntitled-10 261 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\n262 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n\u00a2 Wewill give tax reliefs to employment-oriented industries\nin non-municipal areas;\n\n\u00a2 We will ensure minimum contribution to government\nexchequer by all profit-earning business units. The concept\nof \u2018zero business units\u2019 will be done away with;\n\n\u00a2 We will give special tax concessions to writers, artists,\nacademics and others engaged in intellectual and cultural\npursuits.\n\nPrice Stability and Consumer Protection\nIt is our firm belief that the price level can be controlled\nonly through maximisation of production and a minimisation of\ncosts of production. This is to be achieved through technology\nupgradation, economics of scale and free competition. Towards\nthis end, the BJP will:\n\u00a2 Ensure an efficient, low-cost, corruption-free PDS, so that\nthere is a regular, assured, timely and adequate supply of\ncommodities to the consumers in the rural, tribal, remote\nand backward areas of our country;\n\u00a2 Supply better quality foodgrains through the PDS by\nenhancing the norms for quality standards rather than\neasing them as has been done by the Congress;\n\u00a2 Make pulses, cooking oil and soap also available through\nPDS, in addition to food-grains, sugar and kerosene;\n\u00a2 Improve the Consumer Protection Act of 1986, and ensure\nits application; and,\n\u00a2 Encourage consumer movements.\n\nBlack Money and Corruption\nStarting from its Jana Sangh days, the BJP has been waging\na relentless battle against the twin evils of corruption and black\nmoney. We are committed to rooting out corruption, thus also the\nmalignancy of black money.\n\u00a2 We will encourage capital creation through funds from\nsuch a parallel economy, retaining the right of government\nto tax the revenue flows from such created capital.\n\u00a2 The BJP will open up sectors such as social forestry,\nwasteland development and housing for rural and urban\npoor.\n\nUntitled-10 262 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 263\n\n\u00a2 We will also review the rationale of the Urban Land Ceiling\nAct, in this context.\nInfrastructure\nWe hold that power, telecommunications, transport (surface,\nsea and air) constitute the basic building blocks of our development.\nWith hardly 50% of the roads surfaced, about 40% of the traffic\nvolume is handled by the National Highway System (NHS) which\nconstitutes hardly 2% of the road network.\nOur Railway network has grown only by 16% over five decades.\nThe ports have become the greatest constraint on our world trade.\nThe dimensions of the power and telecommunications situation\ncripple development.\n\u00a2 Weneed to actively develop a National Waterways network;\n\u00a2 To meet our minimum needs, a staggering 10,000 MW\nhave to be added annually for the next 15 years. Irrigation\nneeds press upon our resources. All these call for large\ninvestments.\n\u00a2 We propose, therefore, to lay the foundations of a strong\nbond market in the country which can take care of the\nmassive financial requirements. We invite foreign capital\nin the field of infrastructure.\n\u00a2 We will initate a framework which will facilitate quick\nredressal of the acute infrastructure crisis based on\ninternational co-operation and partnership.\n\u00a2 We will strive to confine the role of the state to that of a\nfacilitator, withdrawing in favour of suitably structured\nindependent regulatory authorities.\n\nPublic Sector\nAt present the policy relating to public sector is in disarray.\n\u00a2 The BJP believes in confining the public sector only to\nsensitive areas where the nation\u2019s security is involved and\nto areas where the presence of public sector is necessary\nfor providing a moderating or counter-poising role to the\nill effects, if any, of an unchecked private sector.\n\u00a2 Public sector presence will continue in areas furthering\nsocial objectives.\n\u00a2 The remaining public sector that would continue will be\n\nUntitled-10 263 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\n264 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nmanaged with the least interference by government.\n\nIn the case of disinvestment from ailing, non-profitable or sick\npublic sector undertakings, the BJP will constitute a Disinvestment\nCommission for taking care of disinvestment from the country\u2019s\npublic sector.\n\n\u00a2 While disinvesting, care will be taken so that the workers\u2019\ninterests are not harmed.\n\n\u00a2 The National Renewal Fund will be realigned to take\ncare of the constant requirements of retraining and\nredeployment of workers that may be necessary in a fast\ngrowing economy.\n\n* Sales proceeds from PSU disinvestment will be utilised\nonly on capital expenditure.\n\nForeign Trade and Capital\n\nForeign Trade Policy has in the past degenerated into one of\nproviding palliatives. It has now become necessary to strengthen\nthe interface between industry and trade.\n\n\u00a2 We will select core industries and a system of destinations\nand initiate an integrated production for export planning\nwith selective intervention so that this sector, so vital to\nthe economy, acquires dynamism.\n\n\u00a2 We will also strive to forge such alliances with or\nmemberships of regional trading blocs that will give further\nimpetus to our exports.\n\nThe BJP welcomes foreign investment, because we hold that\nit supplies knowledge, technology and know-how and sharpens\nthe quality and competitive edge of our economy.\n\n\u00a2 We will, however, strive to minimise our dependence on\nforeign savings.\n\n\u00a2 We will prioritise foreign investment in sectors that will\npromote exports in preference to sectors that will cater\nsolely or exclusively to the domestic market.\n\n\u00a2 Keeping in view that dissemination of world class\ntechnology is an objective of foreign investment, we will\ngive preference to overseas investors who have domestic\npartners.\n\n\u00a2 We will encourage foreign investment in infrastructure,\n\nUntitled-10 264 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 265\n\nareas of high technology and R & D within India.\n\u00a2 As for MNCs in consumer non-durables, we do not consider\nthem as areas of priority.\n\nIndustrial Policy\n\nIndustry in India has to be enabled to become more productive,\nmore innovative. Only then will it fulfil its main goal: Enhance the\nnational wealth, provide greater employment in ever increasing\nnumbers and thus assist the growth of other sectors, including\nagriculture. For, we ecognise this inseperable interdependence.\nOur exports must compete with the best in the world, add to our\nresources and fiscal health, and thus enable India to achieve the\nstatus that we believe is its destiny. The BJP assures all about\ncreating a healthy investment and industrial environment.\n\nThe BJP believes in the continued role and relevance of the\nsmall-scale sector. This important segment of our national economy,\nwhich has been entirely ignored by the Congress and whose\nvery existence is threatened by the present policy of economic\nliberalisation, will receive all encouragement and help from a BJP\nGovernment.\n\nThe following principles will guide the industrial policy of\nthe BJP:\n\nA. Economic Sovereignty\n\nThe party regards the preservation of the nation\u2019s economic\ninterests as a component of our external economic relations.\nGlobalisation, to us, is not a synonym for the obliteration of national\neconomic interests. Indeed, in the ensuing global competition we\nneed to be constantly mindful of preserving them.\n\nB. Modernisation\n\nBJP stands for a mode 24 and progressive India, open to new\nideas, new technology and fresh capital. A modern India to the BJP\nis not a westernised India; a pale copy of the western economic\nmodels.\n\nC. Decentralisation\n\nUntitled-10 265 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\n266 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nWe stand for a decentralised economic order. The BJP stands for\npolitical as well as economic democracy. The role of the government\nmust change from the restrictive to the supportive and encouraging.\n\nThe BJP will, therefore:\n\n\u00a2 Debureaucratise industrial approvals and cut down the\nplethora of restrictive controls. Industrial Development and\nRegulations Act will be replaced by Industrial Development\nAct;\n\n\u00a2 Encourage research and development as part of the process\nof industrial growth and over-all modernisation;\n\n\u00a2 Hazardous industries will be permitted only in specified\nareas. Separate industrial satellites will be set up exclusively\nfor such units;\n\n\u00a2 Small-scale sector will be given all importance and\nencouragement. We will establish agencies to help the\nsmall-scale sector in purchasing, marketing and selling\ntheir products; and,\n\n\u00a2 Ensure a healthy capital market.\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 266 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\nOur Concept Of Employment\nAnd Labour\u2019s Role\n\nCreating Jobs and Opportunities\n\nApart from employment which will be created in the normal\ncourse by the growth of the economy, special employment schemes\nwill be undertaken by the Bharatiya Janata Party to eradicate\nunemployment.\n\nThe BJP proposes to introduce a scheme of voluntary National\nService to undertake the task of national reconstruction and also\nin order to instill a sense of discipline and nationalism among the\nyouth of the country. This service will aim at reclaiming wasteland\nfor commercial use \u2014 for instance, after reclaiming the waste land,\nit will be used for horticulture, social forestry or any other purpose\nthat will provide the youth involved in the reclamation with\ncontinued income. Similarly, the National Service will be used for\nriver management schemes.\n\nApart from this, the BJP proposes to:\n\n1. Increase employment opportunities in all sectors of the\norganised economy;\n2. Introduce policies and programmes to:\n(i) Develop agriculture, particularly in regions which\nare at present less developed and backward.\n\n(ii) Promote industrial growth with special attention\nto village, cottage and small-scale sectors. Special\nemphasis will be laid on agro-industry.\n\n(iii) Undertake large-scale housing activity that will\ngenerate both jobs and additional shelter in both\nrural and urban areas.\n\nUntitled-10 267 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\n268 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n(iv) Provide transport facilities with special emphasis in\nimproving availability of transport in rural areas.\n\n(v) Augment employment opportunities in villages\nthrough Schemes like Antyodaya, Gokul Gram, Gopal\nGram, Saraswati Yojana as already being implemented\nby BJP governments in Rajasthan and Gujarat.\n\n(vi) Provide and improve infrastructure, especially in\nrural areas, such as roads, small dams and water\nconservation projects.\n\n(vii) Promote vocational training.\n\nLabour\n\nBJP believes in healthy trade unionism. It will:\n\n1. Rationalise and simplify Labour Laws;\n\n2. Recognise unions on the basis of secret ballot and have\nprovisions for comprehensive bargaining;\n\n3. Introduce worker participation from the shop floor to the\nboard room in all public sector projects, public limited\ncompanies and foreign companies operating in India;\n\n4. Protect workers against inflation;\n\n5. Evolve an effective mechanism and ensure better\nimplementation of laws to protect labour from occupational\nhealth hazards arising from industries like asbestos, cement,\nslate, mica, chemicals, textiles, etc. The workers will have\nthe right to be informed about the possible health hazards\nthey could be exposed to on the shop floor; and,\n\n6. Not allow an exit policy without fulfilling corresponding\nobligations towards labour.\n\nGovernment Employees\n\nBJP will set up a permanent Employees Welfare Board witha\nview to resolving the long-standing problems related to:\n\n1. Time scale promotion;\n\n2. Revision of pay scales and award of bonus;\n\n3. Implementation of awards;\n\n4. Housing; and,\n\n5. Social welfare measures and travel concession for retired\n\npersonnel. Oo\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 268 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\nOur Scientific Talent, Our Technology\n\nHarnessing Nature For Human Welfare\n\nThe BJP believes that science and technology must play its due\nrole in transforming India into a prosperous and strong country.\nThe BJP will apply appropriate scientific and technological\nmethods for increasing productivity, eradicating poverty,\nhunger and disease and providing meaningful employment\nalong with the basic amenities of life. We believe that science\nand technology need to be harnessed to improve the lot of the\nvast section of our population living below the poverty line. We\nhold that science is not merely harnessing nature for material\nwealth but is as well for liberating and enriching the mind\nand enlarging the human spirit. The BJP will use science in the\nservice of the poor and develop technology that has a humane\nface. Towards this end, we will:\n\n1. Foster a scientific temper among the people;\n\n2. Use science and technology for increasing productivity\nand generating employment;\n\n3. Implement a vigorous programme of science education\nand research for improving quality of life;\n\n4. Establish a network of centres for application of science\nand technology to rural areas, implement \u2018lab-to-land\u2019\nprogrammes and develop a strong low-cost agro-Industrial\nbase;\n\n5. Put new life into National Laboratories to develop them\nas centres of excellence in applied research;\n\n6. Direct these laboratories to evolve appropriate technology\nfor Indian needs;\n\n7. Accelerate the production of scientific literature in regional\n\nUntitled-10 269 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\n270 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nlanguages and evolve a national terminology for science\nand technology;\n\n8. Create the right working conditions for our best brains to\nremain in India and serve the country and not migrate to\nother lands;\n\n9. Make a systematised effort to bring national laboratories\nand industry together by setting up \u2018Technology Parks\u2019 to\nbe patronised by industry. This will promote cooperation\nbetween industry\u2019s resources and talent in laboratory;\n\n10. Safeguard national interests and our intellectual property\nrights by encouraging research and development;\n\n11. Undertake research in the field of drugs, micro-biology,\nbio-technology, bio-fertilisers etc.; and,\n\n12. Strengthen research in indigenous systems of medicine.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 270 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\nOur Foreign Policy\n\nIndia, the New Millennium, the World\n\nIn a post-Cold War world India will be confronted by many new\nchallenges and opportunities. To meet them, to benefit from the\nopportunities, mindful of the existing global disequilibrium and\nin consonance with India\u2019s national interests, our foreign policy in\nthe emerging decades will be based on the human values of peace,\nequality and cooperation.\n\nThe BJP holds that as a departure from the recent past, Indian\ndiplomacy should be conducted in tune with India\u2019s position as\na strong power and a major player in the world arena. A billion\npeople who do not depend upon anyone for feeding or clothing\nthemselves are a power which cannot be ignored. Our nation needs\nto regain its lost pride and the BJP alone can undertake this task.\nWhile we believe in partnership with everyone, we reject the very\nthought of patronage by anybody. The BJP\u2019s foreign policy will be\nguided by the following agenda:\n\n1. Sovereign equality amongst nations; a rejection of political\n\nor economic hegemonism.\n\n2. Promotion of Asian solidarity; development of South\nAsian Regional Cooperation; and, emphasis on improved\nrelations with neighbouring countries. The BJP does not\naccept outside interference in this region as being beneficial\nfor it.\n\n3. Pakistan continues to follow a policy of fomenting\ninsurgency seeking to create instability and unrest in India.\nThe BJP stands committed to thwarting all these attempts.\nIn this context, we state:\n\n(a) The BJP affirms unequivocally India\u2019s sovereignty over\n\nUntitled-10 271 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\n272 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nthe whole of Jammu & Kashmir, including Pakistan\noccupied Kashmir; and,\n\n(b) The BJP declares that it will not accept any interference\nin our country\u2019s internal affairs.\n\n4. Our relations with the USA will be based on mutual respect\nand a congruence of interests. We note, however, that\nUS policy for this region continues to suffer from lack of\nvision and that it disregards India\u2019s political and security\ninterests.\n\n5. India and Russia have a long tradition of good relations\nand have much to gain from the compatibility of their\ngeopolitical interests in Asia. The BJP will endeavour to\nfurther explore the avenues of bilateral cooperation in this\ndirection.\n\n6. Our relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China offer an\nopportunity to now put them on a footing of friendship\nand cooperation. For this we need to resolve the border\nquestion in a fair and equitable manner. It cannot, however,\nbe ignored that the People\u2019s Republic of China continues\nto support Pakistan militarily and otherwise.\n\n7. The BJP greatly regrets the continuing bloodshed in Sri\nLanka, particularly as India all through its history has had\nwarm fraternal ties with all sections of the population in\nthat country. The BJP is confident that within a united Sri\nLanka it should be possible to fulfil the aspirations of the\nTamil people.\n\n8. The BJP pledges to maintain warm and friendly relations\nwith Nepal, with which India has the closest cultural,\nreligious and historical ties. The BJP will work actively\nfor resolving all outstanding issues. We welcome the\nrestoration of democracy in Nepal.\n\n9. The BJP views with great sympathy the struggle for\nrestoration of democracy in Myanmar. It extends its\nsupport to the task of reconciliation and reconstruction\nin that country with which India has a long border and\nage-old religious, cultural and historical ties.\n\n10. The BJP will try to consolidate further the close and friendly\nties between India and Bhutan.\n\nUntitled-10. 272 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 273\n\n11. Inour relations with Bangladesh, illegal immigration into\nIndia from that country has proved a major irritant. This\nissue has cast its shadow on our bilateral ties and needs\nto be resolved early.\n\n12. Millions of sons and daughters of Mother India, settled\nabroad as Overseas Indians, are considered by the BJP as\nan asset to the country. Their emotional attachment to the\nmotherland is still deep. This must find due expression.\nSchemes will be drawn up to attract substantial investments\nby non-resident Indians. They will be welcome to set up\nindustrial units and industrial parks, and invest in the\ninfrastructure. The BJP will examine afresh the issue of\ndual citizenship.\n\n13. The BJP will launch a vigorous campaign for a permanent\nmembership for India in the UN Security Council.\n\nThe BJP stands committed to peace amongst all nations;\nprosperity for all the peoples of the world; and, an international\nrole for India that befits this great and ancient nation.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 273 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\nOur Nation\u2019s Security\n\nProtecting Our Country\n\nThe BJP accords the highest importance to the security of our Nation,\nour Society and our Citizens. We charge the present government\nwith imperilling our security, internal and external, as never before.\n\nOur defence expenditure has been cut steadily in real terms\nduring the Narasimha Rao regime. This has seriously compromised\nour combat effectiveness. The present Congress government has\nbeen functioning without a full-time Defence Minister for over\nthree years, and this negligence of India\u2019s sword arm has begun\nto affect the morale of our gallant forces.\n\nThe BJP will correct this damaging imbalance. We will accord\ndue importance to all security related issues \u2014 the emerging\nglobal realities and regional complexities demand this as the very\nminimum response from our government.\n\nInternal Security\nThe nature of the state and its relationship with society has\na direct bearing on the level of the citizens\u2019 national commitment.\nAn insensitive and uncaring state erodes the citizens\u2019 allegiance to\nthe nation. The BJP will restore national commitment to its rightful\nplace by establishing a harmonious relationship between state and\nsociety. We will:\n1. Defuse tension in long-festering trouble spots;\n2. Ensure protection of life and property from insurgents\nand foreign mercenaries;\n3. Provide our security apparatus with a free hand to deal\nwith terrorism;\n4. Revitalise and reinforce law and order machinery;\n\nUntitled-10 274 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 275\n\n5. Institute police reforms and upgrade the capability of the\nforce; and,\n\n6. Legislate tough deterrent laws against terrorist and\ndisruptive activities (TADA was repealed to pander to\nvote bank politics) while safeguarding democratic rights.\n\nJammu & Kashmir\n\nThe absence of political far-sightedness and clarity of national\nobjectives has resulted in our nation continuing to have to pay\na price even 50 years after Jammu & Kashmir became a part of\nthe Republic. The failure of successive Congress Governments to\nformulate a Jammu & Kashmir policy that takes into account the\nState\u2019s internal problems has led to a situation where this strategic\nborder state has emerged as the principal challenge to Indian\nnationhood. The BJP realises the magnitude of the challenge and\ndedicates itself to the task of not only solving the internal problems\nof the state but also reclaiming the portion of our territory which\nhas been illegally held by Pakistan for nearly five decades. Without\nrepeating the mistakes of yesteryears and merely reacting to\nPakistan\u2019s moves, we will:\n\n1. Immediately strengthen the civil administration by\ninducting able and honest administrators;\n\n2. Provide a free hand to our security forces to deal with\nthe menace of terrorism and induction of men and arms\nfrom Pakistan, while ensuring that democratic rights are\nnot violated;\n\n3. Cleanse the local police and administration of malcontents\nwho have aligned themselves with the terrorists or are\npro-Pakistan;\n\n4. Declare Doda a disturbed area and invoke the Armed\nForces (Special Powers) Act to prevent this district from\nbecoming a haven for mercenaries and terrorists;\n\n5. Launch a massive welfare programme for all regions of\nthe state and ensure that there is no seepage;\n\n6. Hold free and fair elections in the state after terrorism has\nbeen brought under control and every person, including\nthe Pandits who have been forced out of the Valley, is\nprovided with an opportunity to participate in the polls;\n\nUntitled-10 275 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM\n\f\n276 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n7. Rehabilitate all persons displaced from terrorism-afflicted\nareas of Jammu & Kashmir; and,\n8. Set up regional councils for Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh.\n\nNorth-East\nThe north-eastern states of our country continue to suffer\nfrom the violence perpetrated by insurgency and ethnic strife. Poor\ngovernance, a callous administration, seepage of development\nfunds, and Congress\u2019 politics of manipulation have contributed\nto the alienation of the people and the growth of insurgency.\nIn Assam, ULFA and Bodo militants have begun to strike with\nregularity; in Nagaland and Manipur the NSCN continues with\nits depredation; and, in Tripura, militant tribal outfits have once\nagain reared their ugly heads. The tide of illegal immigration from\nBangladesh has only worsened the situation. The BJP will address\nitself to the problems of our north-eastern States and institute a\ngrievance redressal system monitored from Delhi. It will also take\nthe following steps to restore the rule of law in the troubled States:\n1. Check the inflow of foreign arms and terrorists from\ntraining camps across the border;\n2. Strengthen the security apparatus and intelligence network;\n3. Provide all citizens with identity cards on a priority basis;\n4. Check the narcotics trade and attendant ills in the region;\nand,\n5. Plan and execute an integrated and accelerated economic\ndevelopment programme.\n\nHimalayas\n\nOver the past five decades, our Himalayan bastions have\nbeen strategically pierced. Despite that, the attitude of successive\nCongress governments has remained unchanged. Strategically,\nthe government has failed to restore a balance there, leave alone\nregain the initiative. In the process, we have also lost large national\nterritories to the People\u2019s Republic of China, thus demonstrating\nan absence of strategic thought about our Himalayan bastions. The\nBJP will evolve a security policy for the Himalayas so that India\u2019s\nnational interests are fully safeguarded.\n\nUntitled-10 276 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 277\n\nExternal Security\n\nWe believe that pro-active diplomacy, especially defence\ndiplomacy, coupled with adequate preparedness of our armed\nforces, is the key to securing our frontiers against aggression. This\nrequires both strategy and tactics. The BJP will:\n\n1. Set up a National Security Council;\n\n2. Re-evaluate the country\u2019s nuclear policy and exercise the\noption to induct nuclear weapons;\n\n3. Though the BJP stands committed to a nuclear-free world,\nwe cannot accept a world of nuclear apartheid.\n\n(i) The BJP will thus not agree to the Comprehensive\nTest Ban Treaty (CTBT) unless there is a simultaneous\nagreement for a time-bound global elimination of\nnuclear weapons in their entirety.\n\n(ii) The BJP will not agree to the Fissile Material Control\nRegime(FMCR).\n\n(iii) The BJP will not agree to the Missile Technology\nControl Regime (MTCR).\n\n4. Expedite the serial production of Prithvi and make Agni\nI operational for the deployment of these missiles. In\naddition, hasten the development of Agni IJ;\n\n5. Immediately upgrade conventional weapons and weapons\nsystems of the armed forces;\n\n6. Strengthen the intelligence-gathering system, inclusive of\nall intelligence agencies, initiate a Centre-State initiative on\nintelligence gathering and sharing, step up air surveillance\nof our territory, and acquire state-of-the-art electronic\nequipment;\n\n7. Strengthen the Air Force fleet with new generation aircraft;\n\n8. Make a qualitative and quantitative improvement in our\nnaval capabilities;\n\n9. Invest in R&D in areas of defence and missile technology\nso that we become increasingly self-reliant;\n\n10. Peg defence-related expenditure to real requirements; and,\n\n11. Re-examine the role, structure and composition of the\nnumerous para-military forces and reorganise and reform\nthem.\n\nUntitled-10 277 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM\n\f\n278 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nJai Jawan\n\nThe BJP is rightly proud of our valiant soldiers who have\ndedicated their lives to defend our nation from external aggressors\nand internal subversives. We believe it is our duty to take care of\nour serving jawans and look after those who have retired from\nservice, as well as their families. To fulfil this duty, the BJP will\nadopt the following programmes and policies:\n\n1. The terms of service, including pay and allowances,\nhousing, education for children and pension, of all ranks\nwill be improved so as to attract men and women of high\ncalibre. The present shortage of men and officers does not\nhave to be met by lowering standards of entry;\n\n2. Widows and dependents of jawans who die in action will\nreceive higher benefits and compensation;\n\n3. Pension disparities will be solved and anomalies sorted\nout expeditiously;\n\n4. Hospitals for veterans will be set up throughout the country\nso that no ex-serviceman, irrespective of his rank, is denied\nmedical care;\n\n5. Ex-servicemen\u2019s welfare will be included in the concurrent\nlist;\n\n6. The services of our retired soldiers will be used to the\nmaximum extent possible, especially in insurgency-\naffected areas. Wherever there is a stipulated percentage\nfor employing ex-servicemen, it will be fulfilled;\n\n7. Necessary changes will be made in agricultural and urban\ntenancy laws to secure the proprietary rights of servicemen;\nand,\n\n8. District Sainik Boards will be strengthened.\n\nIllegal Immigration:\nDemographic Invasion \u2014 A Threat to Our Security\n\nWe believe that illegal immigration from our neighbouring\ncountries, especially Bangladesh, has a direct impact on our nation\u2019s\nsecurity and has an unsettling effect on our demography. Given\nthe sheer dimension of numbers there are as many as 1.7 crore\nillegal immigrants, the bulk of them Bangladeshis, living in various\n\nUntitled-10 278 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 279\n\nparts of the country. Illegal immigration is not only transforming\nthe geography, but the sociology, the economy, indeed even the\npolitics of this country. India is facing an explosive issue. If our\ndemographic balance is allowed to be disturbed by inept policies\nand political considerations, various demographic entities are\nbound to come in conflict, thus adversely affecting our security\nenvironment. The invasion of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh\nhas led to an alarming growth ina section of the population in our\nNorth-East, in Assam, in West Bengal, parts of Bihar and Delhi.\nIn certain areas, a section of the population has grown by almost\n100 per cent.\nThe BJP proposes to:\n1. Complete barbed wire fencing along the India-Bangladesh\nborder, beginning with the plains, to prevent infiltration;\n2. Detect illegal immigrants, delete their names from voters\u2019\nlists and arrange for their deportation without any further\ndelay;\n3. Declare all property deals between Indians and illegal\nimmigrants as null and void;\n4. Amend immigration rules and other laws to impose\nstringent checks on illegal entry into India; and,\n5. Expedite the issuance of identity cards to all citizens o\nthe country.\n\n \n\noO\n\nUntitled-10 279 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM\n\f\nOur Villages, Our Farmers,\nOur Poor\n\nTowards a Revitalised Rural Economy\n\nOur country has an abundance of natural resources, fertile lands,\nflowing rivers, rich mineral deposits and verdant forests. More\nthan anything else, we have a large army of farmers that shoulders\nthe onerous task of feeding our people. But the wrong priorities\nof the last 50 years of Congress misrule and the lopsided model\nof development pursued by policymakers have impoverished vast\nsections of our farmers, rendering agriculture economically non-\nviable. Worse, bulk of the monies earmarked for infrastructural\ndevelopment, health, education and civic amenities has been\ncanalised to the urban areas despite the fact that the majority of\nthe population lives in villages.\n\nLess than a quarter of the country\u2019s population, 23.31 per\ncent, lives in urban areas, compared to the overwhelming 76.69\nper cent which lives in villages. As many as 71.4 per cent of our\npeople are economically dependent on agriculture: This sector\nof our economy, therefore, generates the highest employment as\nwell as provides the biggest market. Yet, this sector continues to\nbe neglected by Congress policy-makers.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party believes that India cannot emerge as\na powerful nation until the lot of our farmers is improved, adequate\nattention paid to the agricultural sector, an all-out war launched\nagainst poverty, and investments are made in agro-industry as well\nas small-scale and cottage industry catering to the requirements\nof our villages. Our country\u2019s progress is linked to the well-being\nof our villages, our farmers and our poor.\n\nUntitled-10 280 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 281\n\nCongress\u2019 Policy: Not to Have a Policy on Agriculture\n\nIn the absence of any well thought out agricultural policy\nfocussing on rural development and reconstruction, agriculture is\nfast becoming a losing proposition for our farmers. While fixing\nagricultural prices, successive Congress governments have not\ntaken into account the expenses incurred by our farmers on seeds,\nfertiliser, power, water, pesticides, machinery and labour. No effort\nhas ever been made to bring about parity in the prices of industrial\nand agricultural produce.\n\nAs a result, our farmers are forced to sell the fruit of their labour\nat low prices even while they have to pay ever-increasing prices\nfor the necessary inputs. Not surprisingly, this has contributed to\nthe impoverishment and indebtedness of our farmers, pushing vast\nsections of them dangerously close to or even below the Poverty\nLine. According to the Planning Commission\u2019s own estimates, almost\n42 per cent of our rural population lives below the Poverty Line.\n\nNo less alarming is the fact that the number of our villagers\ndependent on per acre of land has been steadily increasing,\ncompared to other countries where this dependency has dramatically\ndecreased with governments investing in agro-industry which offers\nalternative sources of employment. No effort has been made to set\nup an adequate number of small-scale and cottage industries in our\nrural areas to absorb idle hands. This has also contributed in no\nsmall measure to the impoverishment of our farmers. In 1950-51,\nthe ratio of the disparity between the per capita income in rural and\nurban areas was 1:2; in 1995-96 it stood at 1:4. Similarly, while per\nfamily income has risen by 52 per cent in urban areas since 1952,\nit has increased by a mere 7.8 per cent in rural areas.\n\nIronically, these neglected villages form a vast market and from\nthis market, as much as Rs 48,000 crores flow to our urban areas\nevery year. By killing our villages, we will be destroying this market.\nConversely, by developing our villages, we will be strengthening\nthis market, which in turn will benefit our urban areas. In other\nwords, urban India cannot survive without rural India.\n\nBut this simple truth has been ignored for the last 50 years.\nToday, three out of every four Indians live in villages, condemned\nto a life of exploitation and increasing social, political and economic\n\nUntitled-10 281 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM\n\f\n282 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nmarginalisation.\n\nBJP\u2019s Agenda For Our Farmers, Our Poor\n\nWe pledge to reverse this trend of social, political and economic\nmarginalisation of our rural population and empower our farmers.\nWe are committed to restoring agriculture to its rightful place\nand thus steering our people into an era of prosperity and social\nequality by the opening decade of the new century.\n\nNo country can be great if its people remain poor. Our first\ntask will be to wipe out the dark curse of poverty. We will allocate\ngreater resources for effective poverty alleviation programmes;\nwe will invest in agriculture and small-scale industry; we will\nbuild from the bottom up, for that is the only way we can build\nan enduring edifice of development.\n\nTo develop rural India, the BJP will:\n\n1. Allocate 60 per cent of plan funds for agricultural and\n\nrural development;\n\n2. Treat villages as the basic unit of development and provide\neach village with basic facilities like roads, irrigation,\ndrinking water, education, health and sanitation;\nProvide shelter to the homeless in our villages;\n\n\u00bb\n\n4.

Over\n70 million animals are employed in farming operations in Indian\nvillages, more than 80% rural transport needs are met by the\nbullock-cart.

To ensure\nan equitable disbursement of resources so that the largest number\nof our people benefit from development policies, we must arrest the\ncountry\u2019s runaway population and growth. An increasing population\ncan only mean a decreasing share of the fruits of development.\nSuccessive Congress Governments have ignored this crucial area\nof development planning, often for petty political motives. This\nhas resulted in a steep rise in population and severe demographic\nimbalances. The Bharatiya Janata Party believes that children\nare born \u2014 and have the right \u2014 to be happy, and not merely\nfor existence. We will, therefore, put population-related issues,\nespecially family planning, firmly back on the national agenda, and\nlaunch a people\u2019s movement against the impending population\nexplosion through persuasive policies. The BJP proposes to:\n\n1. Act on the reports of the National Development Council\nand the Swaminathan Committee to formulate a National\nPopulation Policy that will stabilise the population growth\nby the first decade of the new century;\n\n2. Enact a law that will debar those with more than two\nchildren from holding elected office, with 1996 as the\ncutoff year;\n\n3. Provide incentives to those among the economically\nweaker sections who opt for the \u2018two-child\u2019 norm in the\nform of special facilities for health, education, nutrition\nand employment opportunities. At the same time, the BJP\nwill also introduce disincentives like limiting subsidised\n\nUntitled-10 293 11/7/2016 11:19:39 PM\n\f\n294 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nration and maternity benefits to two children with 1996\nas the cut-off year. These disincentives will apply to all\nsections of society, irrespective of their social, economic or\nreligious status to discourage large, unsustainable families;\n\n4. Ensure universal access to family planning information\nand quality facilities by involving non-government\norganisations, and promote awareness among the people,\nespecially women, through counselling and educational\nprogrammes\n\n5. Introduce family planning methods and facilities that will\nallow women greater freedom of choice without imperilling\ntheir health;\n\n6. Launch a special campaign for women to seek about\nnegative practices and encourage reproductive health\nservices;\n\n7. Offer a special incentive in the form of a fixed deposit that\nwill mature in 21 years for those couples who have only\na girl child under a \u2018Dattak Putri Yojana\u2019.\n\n8. Make family planning an integral part of policies to ensure\nwidest applicability of these incentives and disincentives.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 294 11/7/2016 11:19:39 PM\n\f\nOur Environment\n\nOnly One Earth\n\nThe BJP holds as a firm conviction that our \u2018only one Earth\u2019 is the\nendower of all our wealth and natural resources. This, however, is\nnot for endless exploitation. Our environment has to be protected,\nnot only to prevent the sanctity of Mother Earth from being\nprofaned but also because our forests, our rivers and our skies\nsustain a multitude of lives. No less important is the crucial role that\nenvironment plays in our nation\u2019s security. Environment must be\nprotected by subscribing to the concept of \u2018sustainable development\u2019,\na philosophical tenet that is integral to our civilisational and cultural\nconsciousness. The BJP will:\n\n1. Introduce a National Environment Policy incorporating\na healthy balance between development needs and\npreservation of natural resources. The interests of and\nconsultation with states will be fully ensured. To implement\nthe policy, the Ministry of Environment and Forests will\nbe recast as the Ministry for Ecological Security;\n\n2. Implement better management and harnessing of river\nwaters as well as sources of ground water;\n\n3. Control land, air and water pollution by industry and\nurban centres. Municipal sewage treatment plants will\nbe made obligatory;\n\n4. Formulate a programme for developing sustainable cities,\nwith special emphasis on waste management and use of\nnatural resources like water;\n\n5. Make environment studies a part of school, college and\nuniversity curriculum and make environment issues an\nintegral part of the visual media so that our children\n\nUntitled-10 295 11/7/2016 11:19:39 PM\n\f\n296 * Party Document Vol-1\n\ndevelop a caring and protective attitude towards the\necological system that sustains our lives;\n\n6.

Minimise the use of non-biodegradable material for\npackaging by the consumer non-durable products industry;\n\n11. It will restrain the conversion of forests or grazing areas\nfor other purposes;\n\n12. Adopt aforestation policies to be fulfilled within a given\ntimeframe and prevent the degradation of forests by\nnatural or manmade causes. The cornerstone of the BJP\u2019s\nforest policy will be a part of the total framework of\nland management, adoption of a dynamic programme\nof productive forestry and moving to private investment\nin forestry from total state management of forests. A\nprogramme will also be drawn up for the conversion of\ndegraded forests, wasteland and marginal land into quality\nforests;\n\n13. Deny exploitation of offshore resources, especially marine\nlife, by big trawlers;\n\n14. Promote R&D in environment-related studies and eco-\ntechnology for application in agriculture, industry and\nthe services sector;\n\n15. Provide incentives to manufacturers of eco-friendly\nproducts;\n\n16. Not sanction tourism-related projects that disturb the\nenvironment and cause degradation.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 296 11/7/2016 11:19:39 PM\n\f\nOur Social Philosophy\n\nHarmony and Equality through Integral Humanism\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s social philosophy, which is the bedrock\nof its social agenda, is rooted in integral humanism. It rules out\ncontradictions between society and its various components, as also\nbetween society and the individual, or, for that matter, between\nthe family, the basic building brick of our social structure, and the\nindividual. From this stems the BJP\u2019s commitment to the eradication\nof social and economic disparities that have prevented India from\nemerging as a modern, dynamic nation; to the creation of a socially\nintegrated Bharatiya society which can proudly enter the new\ncentury. The BJP will help all socially and economically weak and\nbackward sections of society, through special welfare and other\nschemes, to reach their full potential, For us, it is a historic task\nwhich we are resolved to fulfil.\n\nEquity and Equality\n\n1. The BJP will adhere, through its policies and programmes,\nto the ideals, principles and goals of equity and equality\nas enshrined in our country\u2019s Constitution;\n\n2. The BJP will promote a casteless socio-economic order\nwhich will effectively provide access to equal opportunities\nto all citizens, irrespective of their caste, creed, religion or\ngender;\n\n3. The BJP will ensure that the place of an individual in society\nwill not be determined on the basis of his birth; and\n\n4. The BJP will dismantle practices, customs, beliefs, usages\nand institutions which are divisive and discriminatory, and\nwhich in any manner hurt the dignity of the individual.\n\nUntitled-10 297 11/7/2016 11:19:39 PM\n\f\n298 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nUntouchability\n\n1. The BJP condemns unequivocally the practice of\nuntouchability which is not only against the law of the\nland but runs counter to the very concept of integral\nhumanism. Not surprisingly, the first brick of the Ram\ntemple at Ayodhya was laid by a member of the Scheduled\nCastes, Kameshwar Chaupal.\n\n2. The BJP will endeavour to create an ethos of equality in\nsocial and inter-personal relationships.\n\nWeaker Sections\n\n1. The BJP will make the existing institutions and Constitutional\nsafeguards for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\noperationally more effective.\n\n2. The BJP views the provision of special facilities and special\nopportunities, including reservations, in the Constitution\nas practical steps to advance the deprived and under-\nprivileged sections of society. The BJP will continue with\nthe existing policy on reservations till social and economic\nequity is achieved.\n\nOur Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\n\nThe BJP\u2019s goal is to achieve social equality for all Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes through political and economic\nempowerment. To achieve this goal, the BJP will:\n\n1. Stringently enforce laws against untouchability;\n\n2. Inquire into all cases of atrocities, publish the findings,\npunish the guilty and rehabilitate the victims as\nexpeditiously as possible;\n\n3. Lay stress on education, vocational training and skill\nupgradation;\n\n4. Take prompt action to fill up the backlog in jobs reserved for\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The reservations\npolicy will be backed up with a statute;\n\n5. Set up a financial agency on the lines of NABARD to\ncater to the individual and institutional credit needs of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes;\n\nUntitled-10 298 11/7/2016 11:19:39 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 299\n\n6. Provide more facilities for greater participation of Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes in small scale, cottage and\nrural industries, as well as in trade and commerce;\n\n7. End the pernicious practice of carrying night soil and\naccelerate the rehabilitation of those engaged in scavenging;\n\n8. Wipe out the evil of bonded and child labour and\nrehabilitate the victims;\n\n9. Launch a massive housing programme for the homeless\nin villages;\n\n10. Allot pattas for land, home site and homes in the name of\nwives/widows/ daughters;\n\n11. Take necessary steps to protect tribals from exploitation,\nespecially by contractors, and indebtedness;\n\n12. Amend the existing forest policy to restore to the Vanvasis\ntheir rightful share of forest wealth and produce, as well\nas provide viable marketing facilities;\n\n13. Expedite the processing of the claims of Vanvasis and\nGirijans for pattas in forest and hill areas;\n\n14. Disallow the diversion of monies from Plan and Tribal\nSubPlan funds meant for the welfare and development\nof Vanvasis and Girijans;\n\n15. Prevent land alienation through conversion of tribal lands\nfor industrial and other purposes;\n\n16. Formulate and implement a National Policy for the\nrehabilitation of families displaced by development\nprojects. This rehabilitation policy will be multi-dimensional\nand not merely provide financial compensation or\nmeans of livelihood. Governed by the principle of \u2018total\nrehabilitation\u2019, it will include social, economic, educational,\nenvironmental, occupational and cultural aspects.\n\n17. Encourage the setting up of inter-state regional coordination\ncouncils to implement a common welfare programme for\ntribals living in contiguous areas of neighbouring states.\n\n18. Erect a befitting memorial in honour of Maharishi Valmiki\nand Babasaheb Ambedkar in the national Capital.\n\nUntitled-10 299 11/7/2016 11:19:39 PM\n\f\n300 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nOur Socially and Educationally Backwards\n\nThe BJP is committed to providing both social and economic\njustice to the socially and educationally backward classes (Other\nBackward Classes) through the instrument of reservations. At the\nsame time, we hold that the path to progress of all sections of our\npeople lies not through social divisions brought about by casteist\npolitics but through social harmony. The BJP advocates:\n\n1. Continuation of reservations for the Other Backward\nClasses till they are socially and educationally integrated\nwith the rest of society;\n\n2. A uniform criterion for demarcating the \u2018creamy layer\u2019;\n\n3. Flow of reservation benefits in an ascending order so that\nthe most backward sections of the OBCs get them first;\n\n4. Ten per cent reservation on the basis of economic criteria\nto all economically weaker sections of society, apart from\nthe Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and the Other\nBackward Classes; and,\n\n5. Special programmes to provide education and vocational\ntraining as well as awareness campaigns.\n\nEnabling Our Disabled\n\nAs many as five crore of our people have been socially,\npolitically and economically marginalised because of their physical\nand other disabilities. Successive Congress governments have not\nonly abdicated their responsibility towards these less fortunate of\nour citizens, but also resisted their empowerment and, therefore,\ntheir inclusion in the national mainstream. The level of official\napathy can be gauged from the fact that during the last year of its\ntenure, the Rao Government allocated Rs 42 crore for the welfare\nof the disabled, which works out to Rs 8 per person.\n\nThe BJP believes that those who have been excluded from\nplaying a participatory role in the nation-building process by\nbeing stigmatised as \u2018disabled\u2019, should be empowered so that they\nbecome productive, proud citizens of our country. Towards this\nend, we propose to:\n\n1. Order a special survey to collect data about the number\n\nof people who are physically and otherwise disabled and\n\nUntitled-10 300 11/7/2016 11:19:40 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 301\n\nthe nature of their disability;\n\n2. Use this data to formulate policies aimed at empowerment\n\nrather than merely welfare;\n\nActively campaign to remove social prejudices;\n\n4. Sensitise the bureaucracy to the needs and aspirations of\nthe disabled people;\n\n5. Provide employment in all suitable categories of government\nservice through a policy of equal opportunity;\n\n6. Give incentives to the private sector to provide disabled\npeople with job opportunities;\n\n7. Offer medical, counselling and rehabilitation facilities at\nhealth care centres by increasing budgetary allocation\nand encouraging state governments to make a matching\ncontribution; and,\n\n8. Ensure that disabled people have access to public utilities\nand services.\n\n\u00bb\n\nOur Minorities\n\nWherever and whenever the Bharatiya Janata Party has been in\npower, it has ensured peace and security for all sections of society,\nirrespective of their religious identity. The BJP is committed to\nfurther strengthen this achievement. This is in stark contrast to the\ninsecurity faced by minority communities under Congress rule.\nWe have been steadfastly opposed to appeasement as state policy\nsince it benefits only those sections which profess regressive and\nretrograde social norms in the guise of protecting their religious\nbeliefs. The BJP will be guided by its policy of \u2018justice for all,\nappeasement of none\u2019. A resurgent India will enter the 21st century\nwith the resolve of one nation, one people and one culture. To\nachieve this goal, we will:\n\n1. Guarantee all minority communities equal opportunity\nfor economic development;\n\n2. Lay stress on education and vocational training;\n\n3. Provide incentives to those who are self-employed,\nespecially artisans, and those who want to set up their\nown business enterprise;\n\n4. Launch community programmes to create awareness\namong women members of minority communities;\n\nUntitled-10 301 11/7/2016 11:19:40 PM\n\f\n302 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n5. Ensure equality for all and discrimination against none on\ngrounds of religion in matters of education by amending\nArticle 30;\n\n6. Disband the Minorities Commission and entrust its\nresponsibilities to the National Human Rights Commission;\n\n7. Set up special courts for speedy trial of those accused of\nparticipating in communal riots;\n\n8. Protect wakf property from being usurped and misused\nby unscrupulous individuals and organisations and help\nwakf boards to become self-sustaining bodies so that they\ndo not have to be dependent on government doles;\n\n9. Set up trusts along the line of the Tirupati Temple Trust\nwith official nominees for managing the affairs of dargahs;\n\n10. Ensure that no religious property is misused or usurped;\n\n11. Ban all foreign funds irrespective of the organisation which\nis the recipient;\n\n12. Make fraudulent conversions, including those done by\nholding out the promise of economic or social benefits,\npunishable offence and introduce a system of registering\nall conversions;\n\n13. Ban the publication of job advertisements that mention\nreligious identity as a criterion; and,\n\n14. Set up a Commission of Inquiry (similar to the Neogi\nCommission) to inquire into the activities of foreign\nmissionaries and other organisations that have been\nreceiving foreign funds.\n\nHuman Rights\n\nThe BJP subscribes to the view that human dignity, justice\nfor all and protection of the individual from the tyranny of the\nstate are among the basic tenets of Hindutva. We are committed\nto upholding the human, democratic and civil rights of every\nindividual, irrespective of the person\u2019s caste, creed, religion or\ngender. But, we will not allow this commitment to be used as a\nshield by those who commit inhuman atrocities and thus forsake\ntheir claim to human rights. The BJP believes that the state should\nbe fair to all citizens, but firm while dealing with those who militate\nagainst civil society. The BJP will not allow any foreign interference\n\nUntitled-10 302 11/7/2016 11:19:40 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 303\n\nin our country\u2019s internal affairs on the pretext of monitoring human\nrights violations. We will:\n\n1. Strengthen the existing National Human Rights Commission\nthrough more powers, additional resources and better\ninfrastructural support;\n\n2. Disband the Minorities Commission, which has only\nsucceeded in feeding separatist sentiments and giving rise\nto imagined grievances, and entrust its responsibilities to\nthe National Human Rights Commission;\n\n3. Take swift action on the basis of the Commissions findings\nand punish the guilty; and,\n\n4. Include the study of human, democratic and civil rights\nin school curricula.\n\nDisplaced Communities: Protecting their Rights\n\nSeparatist violence and Islamic fundamentalism/ terrorism in\nJammu and Kashmir has forced more than 300,000 people, including\n250,000 Kashmiri Pandits and Punjabi and Dogra Hindus, apart\nfrom thousands of Sikhs and even some Muslims, to flee their\nhomes and hearths. Most of the displaced Pandits are living in\nabysmal conditions in refugee camps in Jammu and other parts\nof the country. Together, they perhaps form the largest internally\ndisplaced community in the world, forced to live as refugees in\ntheir own motherland, condemned to the mercy of an uncaring\nand callous Congress government at the Centre and its puppet\nadministration in Jammu and Kashmir. The Bharatiya Janata Party\nhas mobilised its own resources, men and material to provide\nsuccour to these unfortunate victims of government apathy and\nterrorist violence. But a lot more needs to be done.\n\nSimilarly, thousands of Buddhist Chakmas have fled the\nChittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh in the face of persecution by\nMuslim settlers from the plains and the Bangladesh Rifles. Most of\nthem are at present living in camps in Tripura. Regardless of the\ngrim future that awaits them back home, the Government of India\nhas shown unnecessary haste in trying to repatriate them \u2014an action\nthat is largely motivated by the petty politics of the Congress. The\nBJP is opposed to such forced repatriation in the absence of foolproof\nsecurity guarantees from the Government of Bangladesh.\n\nUntitled-10 303 11/7/2016 11:19:40 PM\n\f\n304 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nThe escalating conflict in Sri Lanka between Sinhalese and\nTamils is posing a demographic threat to South India with a large\nnumber of Tamil refugees beginning to pour into this region. Such\na movement is bound to increase the influence of the LTTE which\nmay, in turn, promote separatist tendencies.\n\nWe must also address ourselves to the concerns of nonresident\nIndians, especially those who had settled in Hong Kong and now\nfind the future uncertain with Britain handing over this territory\nto China in 1997.\n\nThe BJP proposes:\nFor Kashmiri Pandits\n\n1. As urged by them for social cohesion and cultural\npreservation, designate the Pandits who have been\nforced out of Kashmir Valley as an internally displaced\ncommunity.\n\n2. Provide adequate financial relief, proper health, housing,\neducation and employment facilities on a priority basis to\nall displaced families.\n\n3. Take adequate steps to protect their assets and properties\nin Kashmir Valley till such time they are able to return\nhome.\n\n4. Elections in the Valley should be held only after the\ndisplaced people are able to return to their homes.\n\n5. Ensure proper documentation of the displaced Pandits\nand their assets.\n\nFor Chakma refugees\n\n1. Resettle Chakma refugees, the bulk of whom are at present\nin Tripura, in camps in other contiguous States and provide\nfinancial support to their governments so that they do not\nhave to take on the economic burden.\n\n2. Provide full citizenship to those Chakmas who do not\nwant to return to Bangladesh and whose children were\nborn in India.\n\n3. Negotiate with Bangladesh for the phased repatriation\nof those Chakmas who want to return, provided Dhaka\n\nUntitled-10 304 11/7/2016 11:19:40 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 305\n\nguarantees their safety and well-being.\n\n4. Ensure full security for the Chakmas who live in refugee\ncamps so that they are not harassed or threatened.\n\n5. Maintain an official register of Chakma refugees and their\nwhereabouts.\n\nFor Sri Lankan Tamil refugees\n1. House them in refugee camps and monitor their movements.\n2. Prevent their association with local organisations or opening\nlocal chapters of Sri Lankan organisations.\n3. Screen the antecedents of the Tamil refugees and disallow\nasylum to those who have or had links with Tamil terrorists.\nMaintain a register of all such refugees.\n\nol\n\nRepatriate Tamil refugees as soon as the situation is\nconducive for their safe-being.\n\nFor non-resident Indians\n1. Provide citizenship to those Hong Kong based Indians\nwho wish to return to their motherland.\n2. Help rehabilitate the returning Hong Kong based Indians.\n3.

It will\nredefine the concept of development to accommodate the Bharatiya\nway of living, belief system and values to reach the ultimate goal\nof Bharatiyata. We hold that it is necessary to emphasise the\nlinkage of development elements to cultural elements, including\nlocal relevance, relevance to geographical and environmental\nfactors, historical traditions, traditional knowledge and skills. We\nbelieve that cultural factors play an important role in energising\na nation. For a resurgent India whose people can proudly flaunt\ntheir Bharatiyata, the BJP will:\n\nUntitled-10 306\n\n1.

Declare all places of pilgrimage as national heritage centres;\n\n6. Encourage the study of Sanskrit and strictly enforce the\nthree-language formula in schools;\n\n7. Promote Bharatiya classical music and performing arts\nthrough state support; and,\n\n8. Discourage indecent representation of women in\nadvertisements and publications; young minds. Sex and\nviolence on the silver screen are beginning to gnaw at the\nmoorings of our cultural ethos.\n\nTo check this abuse of popular cinema, the BJP will:\n\n11/7/2016 11:19:41 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 307\n\n1. Provide film-making the status of industry so that producers\ncan be made accountable for their resources and expenses;\n\n2.

Analogous to the concept of the Customs \u2018green channel\u2019,\nprovide automatic certification for films which do not\ncontain explicit scenes and dialogues of violence and\nsexproducers and exhibitors of such films will not have to\nwait in the queue for Censor Board clearance.

The BJP has a tryst\nwith the youth of India and will harness their creative energy for\nbringing about social, cultural and political change. We will aim\nat transforming Yuva Sankalpa into Yuva Shakti, which, in turn,\nwill be the catalyst for reinvigorating India.\n\nWe will inculcate in the country\u2019s youth a sense of pride in\nour ancient traditions and heritage. We will instil in them a sense\nof self-confidence so that they can take their rightful place in the\nvanguard of change.\n\nTowards this end, through its policies and programmes, the\nBJP will:\n\n1. Inculcate in the youth a sense of being indebted to society\nat large and thus prepare them to repay this debt by\ninvolving themselves in development programmes and\nsocial, cultural and economic activities;\n\n2. Initiate schemes both at Government and Non-Government\nlevels to achieve overall development of young talent;\n\n3. Mobilise the youth to fight regressive and retrograde\nsocial practices and customs by making community\nservice a compulsory and integral component of college\nand university curricula;\n\n4. Set up a National Youth Commission and a Youth\nDevelopment Bank to design and implement comprehensive\nemployment oriented education policies as well channelise\nyouth power for the purpose of nation-building;\n\n5.

The emphasis of our state\ngovernments, be it in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi or Maharashtra\n(where it shares power with the Shiv Sena), or earlier in Uttar\nPradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, has been on\nensuring peace, progress and prosperity.\n\nThe distinctive feature of our State Governments is their\nsingular achievement in curbing communal and caste conflict. This\nis in stark contrast to the situation that prevails in States ruled by\nthe Congress or the Janata Dal where the law and order machinery\nhas virtually collapsed. A shining example of our achievement on\nthis front is the communal peace that prevails in Maharashtra which\ntill recently was wrecked by riots and social conflict. Similarly, the\nBJP government in Gujarat has ensured peace.\n\nThis has been achieved by cracking down on anti-social and\nanti-national activity. The underworld mafia, which flourished under\nCongress rule, has been brought to book. The criminal-politician\nnexus has been broken. Blackmarketeers, and other criminals, who\nsurvived because of Congress patronage, have been put behind\nbars or are facing prosecution.\n\nThe emphasis on enforcing law and order is not without reason.\nFor, unless there is peace, there cannot be progress and prosperity.\n\nIn the field of development, our state governments have\nfocused their attention on the rural sector, because the majority\nof our people live in the villages. Not only have effective steps\nbeen taken to solve the problems of our farmers, but innovative\n\nUntitled-10 310 11/7/2016 11:19:41 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 311\n\nschemes have been introduced to generate employment and fight\nthe scourge of poverty.\n\nFor instance, the BJP government in Rajasthan has earmarked\nmore than 60 % of Plan allocation for rural areas. As many as\n12.86 lakh farmers and artisans have benefited from the state\ngovernment's decision to write off loans amounting to more than\nRs 300 crores. The state government has also written off irrigation\nloans amounting to Rs 124 crores and introduced more effective\nmeans of irrigation. Tax relief on seeds, a wide range of agricultural\nproduce and equipment has further helped the farmers. Similarly,\nthe state government has reduced sales tax on fertlizers and made\na five-fold increase in agricultural loans.\n\nOn the social front, the government has introduced innovative\nschemes like Gopal Gram Yojana and Saraswati Yojana. The first\nscheme not only aims at improving the quality of livestock but also\nproviding people with a sustained income. Similarly, Saraswati\nYojana has a two-fold purpose: Universalising primary education\nand providing employment to the educated youth of the villages.\nSchemes like Shiksha Karmi Project and Guru-Mitra Yojana have\nalso contributed immensely to increasing literacy levels. Vikalp, a\nspecially designed family planning programme based on incentives\nand which protects the girl child, has been immensely successful.\n\nThe Rajasthan Government has also introduced a new industrial\npolicy to attract both Indian and foreign investors. The policy has\nalready begun to pay rich dividends. The government has signed\nMOUs for the setting up of new power plants. Soon, the state shall\nhave the largest solar power plant.\n\nIn Gujarat, the BJP government has maintained communal\nharmony in the trouble-prone areas. Latif, a notorious criminal\ninvolved in bootlegging and anti-social activities, has been\nput behind bars. His underworld activities in the border areas\nof Kutch and Saurashtra have come to a grinding halt. Those\ninvolved in adulteration of petrol with solvents, which had\nbecome an extremely profitable crime during Congress rule, are\nfacing prosecution.\n\nWith law and order restored, the state government has turned\nits attention on development activity. Work on the Sardar Sarovar\nProject is progressing at a remarkable speed. Bonds worth Rs 300\n\nUntitled-10 311 11/7/2016 11:19:42 PM\n\f\n312 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\ncrores were issued and the amount obtained in seven days from\nthe cooperative sector. Simultaneously, those displaced because\nof the project have been rehabilitated,\n\nOn the industrial front, the state government has adopted an\ninvestor-friendly policy which has evoked a tremendous response.\nAn increasing number of Non-Resident Indians have begun to\nshow keen interest in investing in Gujarat. At the same time,\nthe interests of the agricultural sector are not being ignored. For\ninstance, 42 % of the power generated in the state is channelised\nfor agricultural use, compared to 34 % for industry. New power\nplants are being commissioned to meet future requirements. In\nthe last three years of Congress rule, not a single MW was added\nto the installed capacity.\n\nOn the social front, the state government has reduced bus fares\nby 20%, a move which has brought tremendous relief to millions\nof people. Poor families are being provided with wheat at Rs 2 per\nkg. More than 40 lakh families have already been covered by this\npoverty alleviation scheme.\n\nThe biggest success of the Gujarat Government has been the\nGokul Gram Yojana, a scheme to develop the villages and provide\na better quality of life to villagers. The aim is to make the 18,090\nvillages of the State self-reliant and provide them with basic\nfacilities ranging from roads to drinking water to schools and proper\nsanitation. Since this is a participatory model of development, the\ngovernment has sought the people\u2019s participation. The response\nhas been tremendous: Even NRIs have come forward to contribute\nto the scheme.\n\nTo empower women, the state government has introduced\nschemes like Kuvarbai-nu-Mameru and Ghar Divda. Daughters of\npoor families receive financial support at the time of their marriage.\nTribal girls have been provided with bicycles so that they can attend\nschool. The Daridra Narayan Yojana has encouraged children from\npoor families to attend school. Under this scheme, children get free\nuniforms and books in addition to monetary incentives.\n\nOn the agricultural front, farmers are now allowed to buy\nland in any part of the state. New insurance policies have been\nintroduced to provide extensive cover. The quality of seeds,\npesticides and fertilizers has been improved and there has been\n\nUntitled-10 312 11/7/2016 11:19:42 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 313\n\na three-fold increase in the allocation for drip irrigation. Farmers\ntoday get adequate power supply.\n\nIn Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena-BJP Government has spared\nno effort to break the vicious grip which the mafia had established\nover the administration. The law and order machinery has been\nstrengthened and the police made accountable.\n\nIn Maharashtra, too, the emphasis has been on restoring law\nand order and implementing schemes aimed at providing a better\nquality of life for the people. This is most obvious in the rural areas\nwhere even small farmers today are provided with power for their\npumps and insurance cover for their crops. The government has\nundertaken a massive programme to provide drinking water to\nevery village.\n\nTo protect the poor from inflation, the state government has\nfrozen the prices of five essential commodities. The poorest of the\npoor are covered by the jhunka-bhakar scheme: For a rupee, a\nperson can have a meal. Those who cannot afford to pay for health\ncare, have been provided with free health services. Meritorious\nstudents from poor families are being provided with all incentives\nto ensure that they do not drop out of schools. A programme has\nbeen adopted to provide free housing to 40 lakh slum-dwellers in\nMumbai.\n\nThe state government has initiated steps to ensure that those\nwho perpetrate crimes against women are punished immediately.\nKamdhenu Yojana provides women with sustained employment.\nFor the girl child, a special scheme has been introduced to ensure\nthat her education and health care needs are taken care of. The\nMaharashtra Government has taken the first bold step to dismantle\nthe practice of polygamy.\n\nAbove all the state government has restored probity in public\nlife: They have provided the people with a clean and transparent\nadministration. The Enron deal was scrapped because the cost was\ninflated. A committee of experts renegotiated the deal with Enron\nand the new agreement has resulted in savings worth Rs 25,000\ncrores. The cost per unit of power has also been brought down by\n54 paise The biggest gain is that by bringing down the project cost,\nthe Maharashtra Government has set new parameters for power\nprojects elsewhere in the country.\n\nUntitled-10 313 11/7/2016 11:19:42 PM\n\f\n314 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nThe BJP Government in Delhi has achieved the unique\ndistinction of fulfilling 94 of the 100 promises which the party\nhad made within two years. This despite the fact that the state\ngovernment is hamstrung by restrictions imposed by the Union\nGovernment. The focus has been on improving the quality of life\nof a common man.\n\nThe BJP had promised that if voted to power, it would pursue\nthe prosecution of those involved in the November 1984 anti-Sikh\nriots. We are proud of the fact that our government has successfully\nreopened the investigations which were suppressed by the Congress.\nSome of the guilty people have been brought to book. The others\nwill also be brought to justice.\n\nThe BJP Government has provided Delhi with a corruption-free\nadministration. Several steps have been taken to end \u2018inspector raj\u2019\nand simplify rules and regulations. Schemes have been introduced\nfor employment generation and to encourage entrepreneurs. Those\nliving in slums have been provided with basic amenities.\n\nThese are only some of our achievements, the highlights of our\ngovernments\u2019 performance. Much more remains to be done and we\nare committed to completing the task we have set for ourselves.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 314 11/7/2016 11:19:42 PM\n\f\nLet\u2019s Commence A New Chapter\n\nThis then is the blueprint which the Bharatiya Janata Party will\nimplement on coming to power. The task will be undertaken by\nthe party\u2019s inspiring team of leaders, each one of whom has an\nunmblemished record of self-less service to the nation. It is through\nthis blueprint that the BJP will bring about radical change in the\ncountry\u2019s polity, society and economy. It is this blueprint which\nwill be the bedrock of a new India where every citizen shall be free\nfrom fear, hunger and discrimination. This blueprint will pave the\nway to the next century and the new millennium.\n\nBut to implement our commitments we need your support. The\nsweeping change that has become so necessary to save the nation\ncan be brought about only with your help. To begin with, you\nhave to change the leadership at the helm of the country\u2019s affairs\nand vote out the Congress. The time has arrived for a nationalist\ngovernment which will lead India from the dark curse of poverty\nto prosperity; which will free the administration from the clutches\nof criminals and restore probity in public life; which will reinvest\nthe state with authority and strengthen our security forces; and,\nwhich will secure our country\u2019s frontiers so that we do not have\nto suffer once again the humiliations of this millennium. Such a\ngovernment can be provided only by the BJP.\n\nThe past five decades have been a tragic story of missed\nopportunities and self-serving opportunist politics. The Congress\nhas abused power and authority for the benefit of few and to the\ndetriment of millions of Indians. The leaders of the Janata Dal have\ndemonstrated their inability to think beyond themselves. The Left\nparties, orphaned by the passing away of Communism all over the\nworld, are struggling to come to terms with an ideological vacuum.\n\nUntitled-10 315 11/7/2016 11:19:42 PM\n\f\n316 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nNone of these parties can boast of ideological commitment, moral\ncourage and political conviction. On the other hand, the BJP has\nemerged as the only national alternative, a party that stands apart\nfor its ideology, commitment and courage.\n\nWe are standing at an important crossroad of our nation\u2019s\nhistory. The BJP appeals to all patriotic Indians to join the noble\nmission of national reconstruction \u2014 the task of creating a strong\nand prosperous India. Let us be partners in a new era of equality,\npeace and progress.\n\nVande Mataram!\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 316 11/7/2016 11:19:42 PM\n\f\nElection Manifesto\n\n1991\n\n \n\f\nUntitled-10 318 11/7/2016 11:19:43 PM\n\f\nThis We Believe\n\nThe country stands today ona major cross-roads of history. A right\nturn - and the country would be well on its way to fulfilment. A\nwrong turn - and the country would be in serious trouble.\n\nThe electoral contests so far have been mainly bouts between\nvarious shades of Congressmen. Today for the first time Bharatiya\nJanata Party the Party of Independent India, offers itself as an\nindependent and complete alternative to the current confusions.\n\nThe country has been advancing at snail\u2019s pace when it has\nnot actually been declining. Prices are rising and employment\ngeneration rate is falling. The foreign debt trap is closing on us.\nCommunal violence has rocked several States. For the first time\nin history we had immolations by the frustrated flower of Indian\nyouth. State-Centre relations are seriously strained. Opportunistic\nalliances have brought Democracy itself into disrepute. Secessionism\nhas raided its ugly head in Punjab, Kashmir and Assam. And what\nis worse, there is sinister cooperation between these separatist\nterrorists and the people\u2019s war group in Andhra and LTTE in Tamil\nNadu. In the face of this challenge, other parties have gone casteist\ncommunalist or both.\n\nDifferent Political Parties exploited even the tragic Gulf War\nto carve out and corner communal vote banks. The leaders of these\nparties have conclusively proved themselves non-leaders. Taking\nadvantage of this confusion, communists are making attempts to\ngain some respectability. .\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party as the party of Nationalism,\nHolism and Integral Humanism, offers a complete, new and higher\nalternative to the current dismal scene. As the party of Swadesh\nand Swa-dharma, it is wedded to our country, our people and\n\nUntitled-10 319 11/7/2016 11:19:43 PM\n\f\n320 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nour culture. It believes in consensus and cooperation, and not in\ncontrariety and conflict. It would uplift the poor and the down-\ntrodden, without pitting caste against caste, without inciting class\nagainst class.\n\nAs the party of law, order and justice, it would ensure the\nsecurity of life, limb and honour of all citizens. It seeks the restoration\nof Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya only by way of a symbolic\nrighting of historic wrongs, so that the old unhappy chapter of\nacrimony could be ended, and a Grand National Reconciliation\neffected. Hindus and Muslims are blood-brothers. But on account\nof historical reasons their relationship has not been harmonious.\nIt shall be the endeavor of BJP to make all Indians fraternal and\nfriendly once again.\n\nBJP is no prisoner of any dogmas. We will debureaucratise the\nEconomy to maximise production. We will make even the Sarkari\nSector productive and profitable by throwing open some of the\npublic sector units to people\u2019s participation.\n\nThe BJP will modernise the country on the basis of Science\nand Technology, even while strengthening the cultural roots of\nour national life. We want to do a thousand things to uplift the\npeople and upgrade the country. And we have the first Principles,\nthe sound policies, the wise leadership and the dedicated cadres\nto do them and do them well.\n\nTowards A Clean Political System\n\nFrom the Himalaya to Kanya Kumari, this country has\nalways been one. We have had many States, but we were always\none people. We always looked upon our country as Matribhoomi,\nPunyabhoomi. The Atharva Veda says \u2018Janarn bibhrati bahuda\nvivachasam\u2019 -Nana Dharmanam Prithvi yathou kasam.\u2019\n\n(This our motherland gives equal protection to people speaking\ndifferent languages and professing different faiths).\n\nWe have never had a theocracy, with a State Religion, in\nIndia. In fact, it is not possible in India because of its inherent\nmagnanimous cultural heritage. This being our tradition there is\nno room for discrimination against anybody on grounds of caste,\ncreed, language or region. It is the duty of the state to ensure justice\nfor all citizens and for all sections of society. The Bharatiya Janata\n\nUntitled-10 320 11/7/2016 11:19:43 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 321\n\nParty is wedded to National Unity and National Integrity and a\nbalanced development of all regions and all sections. To these ends\nwe will have, politically, not only a strong centre but also strong\nautonomous States.\n\nLaw And Constitution\n\nThe polity will accordingly, be reformed along the following\n\nlines:\n\n1. BJP favours restructuring of Centre-State relations in view\nof the quick economic development and decentralisation.\nBJP will implement the Sarkaria Committee Report on\nCentre-State relations;\n\n2. Article 356 permitting dissolution of a State Government\nby the Centre, will invoke only when the Constitutional\nmachinery has in fact broken down, and not to promote\nany partisan interest;\n\n3. The BJP recognises that regional imbalances have developed\nin some states because of their size. The party would\nappoint a commission to report on formation of smaller\nstates which are economically and democratically viable.\nInitially BJP will have Uttranchal, Vananchal and Union\nTerritory of Delhi as three new states of the Indian Union;\n\n4. Certain regions in some States have an acute sense of\nneglect. These regions e.g. Ladakh and Jammu in J & K\nState, and Marathwada and Vidarbha in Maharashtra -\u2014\nwill be given Regional Development Councils;\n\n5. The States will be given a fairer share of Central revenues;\n\n6. We will appoint an Inter-state Council under Article 263\nto settle all inter-state and State-centre disputes;\n\n7. We will delete the \u2018temporary\u2019 Article 370 from\nthe Constitution, which more than anything else,\npsychologically separates J & K state from the rest of the\ncountry;\n\n8. Article 30 permits minorities to run their own schools. It\nwill be rationalised and suitably amended to ensure justice\n& equality to all irrespective of religions;\n\n9. We will guarantee to all minorities, whether religious or\nlinguistic, peace and security and full opportunities for\n\nUntitled-10 321 11/7/2016 11:19:43 PM\n\f\n322 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nprogress and development;\n\n10. We will set up a commission to study and report\nwhether the Presidential system of Government will\ngive us a more stable Government than the present\nParliamentary system;\n\n11. BJP will examine the feasibility of introducing list system;\n\n12. We will appoint a Law Commission to study various Civil\nLaws. ancient, medieval and modern, to evolve a Common\nCivil Law for the whole country to give our citizens a\nfeeling of unity and brotherhood;\n\n13. We will maintain a National Register of citizens; and\n\n14. In place of the minorities commission which entertains\ncomplaints of discrimination only from minority sections\nwe will have a Human Rights Commission to look into\ncomplaints of injustice against any section of society.\n\nFair Elections\n\nFree and fair elections are the life-breath of democracy. From\ntime to time there are reports of doctored electoral rolls, booth-\ncapturing, physical violence. Money power and muscle power have\nassumed sinister proportions. To restore health to our electoral\nsystem we will:\n\n1. Arrange for public funding of elections;\n\n2. Introduce identity cards with photographs for all voters;\n\n3. Replace ballot boxes by electronic voting machines, to\nprevent rigging and booth-capturing;\n\n4. Give the right of vote by postal ballot to Indian citizens\nliving abroad;\n\n5. Permit company donations to parties - until State funding\nis introduced, to keep black money out of the political\nprocess;\n\n6. Strengthen the independence of the Election Commission\nby making its expenditure a charge on the Consolidated\nFund of India - as is the case with the Comptroller and\nAuditor General and the Supreme Court and various High\nCourts;\n\n7. Hold State Assembly and Lok Sabha Elections simultaneously\nand regularly every five years, avoiding, as far as possible,\n\nUntitled-10 322 11/7/2016 11:19:43 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 323\n\nany mid-term polls;\n\n8. Give legal teeth to the Election Commission\u2019s Code of\nConduct by making violation of the same a corrupt practice\nunder the Election Law;\n\n9. Empower the Election Commission to monitor Akashvani\nand Doordarshan broadcasts and ensure that the same are\nnot misused for any partisan purposes;\n\n10. Fix a realistic limit on a candidate\u2019s election expenses and\nthen include in it not only the money spent by him but\nalso by his party and friends; and\n\n11. Introduce public auditing of party funds.\n\nShri Ram Mandir at Janamsthan\n\nBJP firmly believes that construction of Shri Ram Mandir at\nJamnasthan is a symbol of the vindication of our cultural heritage\nand national self respect. For BJP it is purely a national issue and\nit will not allow any vested interests to give it a sectarian and\ncommunal colour. Hence the party is committed to build Shri Ram\nMandir at Janmasthan by relocating super imposed Babri structure\nwith due respect.\n\nClean Public Life\nBJP attaches the greatest importance to the probity and quality\nof public life. To this end we will\n1. Inquire into all cases of serious corruption in high places;\n2. Require all those holding public office to make an annual\ndeclaration of their own and their dependents\u2019 assets; and\n3. Set an example in simple living, to give a new, higher tone\nto public life.\n\nNorth-east\n\nWe have long had many problems in the North-East beginning\nwith Naga insurgency. And now we have a Bodo problem and also\nthe ULFA problem in Assam proper. BJP will examine outstanding\nregional and sectional problems, redress all legitimate grievances\nand, for the rest maintain law and order with a firm hand. To this\nend we will\n\n1. Have electrified barbed wiring all along the Indo-\n\nBangladesh border, to keep infiltrators out;\n\nUntitled-10 323 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM\n\f\n324 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n2. Check and identify infiltrators, strike out their names\nfrom the electoral rolls and arrange to send them back to\nBangladesh;\n\n3. Declare all property deals between locals and infiltrators\nas null and void;\n\n4. Give all adult citizens in the North-East identity cards\nwith photographs, on a priority basis;\n\n5. To monitor and keep watch on receipt of foreign funds so\nthat it is not used for conversion in the garb of religious\nactivities;\n\n6. Abolish the Inner Line Permit System in all the seven\nNorth Eastern States;\n\n7. Safeguard the interests of bonafide refugees fleeing because\nof religious or political persecution in Bangladesh;\n\n8. Secure the honourable return of Chakmas to Chittagong\nHills, Bangladesh;\n\n9. Plan and organise an integrated and accelerated economic\ndevelopment of the North-East; and\n\n10. Incorporate Manipuri and Nepali in the Eighth Schedule\nof the Constitution.\n\nPunjab\nThe BJP holds Cong. (I) wholly responsible for the Punjab\nproblem. Had the Congress Govt. not toppled the duly elected\nGovermnents, of Prakash Singh Badal, not once, not twice, but three\ntimes, there would have been no Bhindaranwale, no \u2018Blue Star\u2019, no\n\u2018Black Thunder\u2019. Later, it was the loot and murder of thousands of\ninnocent Sikhs in Delhi and else-where in 1984 that has angered\nthe Sikhs, given a handle to Pakistan and encouraged terrorism.\nHowever, the fact that not all the machinations of Pakistan and not\nall the provocations of their terrorist agents, has soured Hindu-Sikh\nrelations, is proof positive that the heart of the Punjab is sound.\nTo mend matters in the Punjab, we will\n1. Create a kilometer-deep Security Belt all along the Indo-\nPak border - as has already been done by Pakistan on its\nown side - to prevent all movement of terrorists, smugglers\nand their lethal cargo;\n2. Post Army Units in the acutely disturbed border areas to\nmaintain order and restore confidence;\n\nUntitled-10 324 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 325\n\n3. Give relief and provide rehabilitation to the widows and\norphans of 1984 outrages;\n\n4. Punish the guilty men of the 1984 terror; and\n\n5. Have the various grievances of the people of Punjab\nexamined in depth by experts, including social scientists\nand redress them suitably.\n\nJammu, Kashmir And Ladakh\nThe BJP views with concern the recent developments in the\nKashmir valley. Widespread violence in the State has led to an\nanarchical situation. This has paralysed tourism, the backbone of\nthe Kashmir economy.\nThe Pakistan - inspired violence against Hindus has caused\nthose Kashmiris to become refugees in their own land. The BJP will\n1. Weed out Pakistani elements from the valley;\n2. Hold free and fair elections in the State as soon as conditions\nstabilise there;\n3. Have separate Regional Development Councils for Jammu\nand Ladakh;\n4. Make relief and rehabilitation facilities available to Kashmiri\nrefugees, settling them particularly in the hills of Pir Panjal\nRange; and\n5. End all uncertainty about the future status of the State by\ndeleting Article 370 of the Constitution.\n\nTelangana\n\nEver since the Razakar excesses in 1947-48 and the Communist\nrebellion in 1948-50, the Telangana area of Andhra Pradesh has been\nmore or less disturbed. In the last few years, People\u2019s War Group,\na Naxalite outfit, has been virtually running a state within a state\nthere. The Congress (I) and T.D.P. have been competing for the\nsupport of P.W.G., which has been holding people to ransom and\nkilling scores of BJP men, and anybody else who would stand up\nto them. BJP will go to the root of the Telangana land problem and,\nfor the rest, crush the lawless elements and restore law and order.\n\nUntitled-10 325 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM\n\f\n326 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nULFA\n\nUnder Congress (I) mismanagement, even a peaceful State\nlike Assam has produced a terrorist outfit like ULFA.\n\nHere again, BJP will redress legitimate grievances and for the\nrest, discipline unruly elements and restore order.\n\nLaw and Order\n\nThe BJP views with concern the alarming rise in social violence,\ninvolving different castes and communities. All this violence is\nmainly due to exciting feelings to carve out certain Vote Banks and\nthen cornering them. The party expects the District Administration\nto take all steps necessary to maintain Law and Order. Should there\nstill be any serious eruption of violence, BJP will\n\n1. Institute an inquiry;\nPublish the findings of such an inquiry;\nPunish the guilty;\nCompensate the victims; and\n\nTe WN\n\nTransform the Police Machinery into an efficient and\ndependable instrument of Law and Order.\n\nJustice and Judicial Reform\nIn a situation of rapid social change, the judiciary holds a\npivotal place. It can ease social tensions by dispensing quick,\ninexpensive and impartial justice. We are sorry to note that on\nall these counts the Judiciary\u2019s performance has been less than\nexemplary, particularly since the Congress (I) came up with the\nploy of a committed judiciary, that is a Judiciary committed to the\nruling party. To stop further erosion of this hallowed institution,\nand restore it to its earlier state, the BJP will\n1. Take suitable measures to clear the arrears;\n2. Through suitable measures BJP will ensure the cases, by\nand large, are decided within one year;\n3. Discourage interminable adjournment of cases for years\non end;\n4. Improve the emoluments of judges to attract better talent;\n5. Raise the retirement age of High Court Judges to 65 - that\nof the lower judiciary to 60;\n6. Give attractive pensions to judges;\n\nUntitled-10 326 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 327\n\n7. Enhance judicial powers of Nyaya Panchayats to ensure\nspeedy justice and to carry to the doorstep of the people;\n\n8. Provide mobile courts for the rural areas;\n\n9. To provide free legal aid to SC and ST to enable them to\nprocure their rights and position as SC and ST; and\n\n10. The role of executive in judicial appointment will be\n\nrationalised to keep it within the framework of spirit of\nthe Constitution.\n\nPanchayati Raj and People\u2019s Power\nThe Panchayat system formed the bedrock of the democratic,\nsocial and political set-up in India since Vedic times. It was this\ndemocratic set-up that absorbed the shock of invasions and protected\nthe integrity of Indian life. In modern times Gandhiji commended\n\u2018Power to the People\u2019 in a \u2018structure composed of innumerable\nvillages\u2019 in which there will be \u2018ever-widening, never-ending circles.\nLife will not be a pyramid with apex sustained by the bottom but it\nwill be an oceanic circle whose centre will be the individual.\u2019 Lok\nNayak Jaya Prakash Narayan also worked for Panchayati Raj and\nDeendayalji pleaded for a statutory status for the village Panchayat\nand the city municipality - in the Constitution. The BJP will\n1. Effectively decentralise power;\n2. Give a constitutional status to local bodies from Village\nPanchayats to Metropolitan City Corporations; and\n3. Involve the Panchayats in all rural development work\nand make 10 per cent of the Development Budget directly\navailable to them.\n\nEconomic Growth with Social Justice\n\nThe Indian economy has reached a point of total collapse as a\nresult of the knock-out blows it has been dealt, by a succession of\nprofligate and irresponsible governments led by Congressmen and\nex-Congressmen. These people have literally robbed the country\nand left its hapless citizens high and dry, staggering from one crisis\nto another and trapped in a rising vortex of high prices, murderous\ntaxes and soaring debts.\n\nThe nation is on the verge of bankruptcy and has been reduced\nto begging for hand-outs from all and sundry. Indian ambassadors go\n\nUntitled-10 327 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM\n\f\n328 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nabroad to beg for loans and even the Prime Minister has to genuflect\nbefore heads of foreign nations. As a result India\u2019s international\nrating has sunk to a new low. India is one of the few countries in\nthe world without a proper government, without a proper budget\nand without a proper economic policy.\n\nThe net result is an upside-down economy in which farmers\nwho produce cotton cannot afford to buy cloth; and masons who\nput up five-star hotels, have no roofs over their heads. For certain\nconsumer durable there is no dearth of demand. It is estimated that\n60 per cent of the consumer durables are purchased by less than 40\ncent of the population. In other words, the Developmental effort\nduring the past four decades has resulted in a Socio-Economic\ndualism.\n\nAll these trends have to be reversed, and the Bharatiya Janata\nParty will reverse them. BJP government will \u2019 bring out White\npaper on State of the Economy soon after assuming power.\n\nThe core sector of our economy will be MAN. State should\nretreat from commercial activities and instead, concentrate on\nbasic functions such as maintaining law and order, justice, welfare\nprogramme, infrastructure etc. We will make our Economy truly\nSwadeshi by promoting native initiatives. It will be an Economy\nof the People, by the People and for the People.\n\nThrough our pragmatic Economic strategy we promise to:\n\n1. Hold the Price Line;\n\n2. Liberate the Economy from the clutches of the bureaucratic\n\ncontrols;\n\n3. Not to hike Excise Duties on items of mass consumption for\n\nfive years and indeed, rationalise the whole tax structure;\n\n4. Reduce non-plan expenditure drastically. Balance the\n\nRevenue Budget (Zero budgetary deficit under Revenue\nAccount) and reduce the overall debt burden;\n\n5. Ensure development of Rural Economy with remunerative\n\nprices to the farmer and network of agro-based industries;\n\n6. Make Public Sector productive and profitable, invite\n\nequity participation in some of the public sector units with\nadequate safeguards;\n7. Use Science, Technology and native wisdom to raise annual\n\nUntitled-10 328 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 329\n\ngrowth rate of Economy from around 5 per cent at present\nto 7.5 per cent;\n8. Create a full fledged Ministry for Handicrafts and Village\nIndustries;\n9. Implement Antyodaya scheme throughout the country;\nand\n10. Launch a nation-wide Employment Guarantee Scheme.\n\nAgriculture: Integrated Rural Development\nAgriculture is our First Priority. The Indian peasant is the\nsalt of the earth and he is the backbone of the country\u2019s economy.\nWhen he prospers, India prospers. We have waived the loam of\npoor agriculturists in Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and\nRajasthan. But the Kisan will continue to flounder in poverty unless\nthe burden of the people depending on agriculture is reduced. A\ncountrywide network of agro-industrial complexes in rural areas\nshould relieve the burden and provide the real answer to the problem\nof poverty of the peasantry. BJP aims at rural development where\nfarmer will not be forced to borrow.\nThe party has offered a new deal to the farmers in terms of\nits Charter of Rights of Kisan. The party will\n1. Ensure remunerative prices-to farmers;\n2. Ensure minimum wages to the farm labour;\n3. Ensure abundant supply of water and energy, the farmers\nhave a natural right to these basic inputs;\n4. Remove all restrictions on the movement of farm produce\nthroughout the country;\n5. Maintain parity of prices between agricultural and industrial\nproducts;\n6. Issue Pass Books to Kisans and Implement the land laws;\n7. Allocate 60 per cent of the plan money, both central and\nstate, for rural development;\n8. Encourage cultivation of pulses, oil-seeds, course grains,\nfruits, vegetables and other cash crops;\n9. Speedily complete on-going irrigation projects, organise\nefficient flood management and relief;\n10. Launch a million small, labour-intensive rural projects.\nCluster of agro-centers would be promoted which would\n\nUntitled-10 329 11/7/2016 11:19:45 PM\n\f\n330 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\ntake up activities directly relating to agriculture and also\nmeet other requirements of villagers. This would help to\ngenerate employment to rural youths who are not actually\nrequired in agricultural activities. e.g. Scientific storage\nfacilities, food processing units, cottage industries etc.\nInvestment in rural industries will be given appropriate\nfiscal incentives;\n\n11. Introduce cattle and crop insurance schemes and also\nupdate the old Famine Code;\n\n12. Improve roads and other means of communication\nto facilitate quick transportation of agricultural and\nhorticultural produce to towns;\n\n13. Provide market value compensation in case of land\nacquisition in one installment, and provide jobs to those\nuprooted in the process;\n\n14. Protect the traditional rights of villagers in Gochar Bhoomi\nand Nistar land;\n\n15. Make Water, Power, a School and a Health Centre available\nin all villages; and\n\n16. Restructure the Agriculture Cost and Price Commission and\nmake it more broad-based, with adequate representation\nto those engaged in farming.\n\nCow Protection and Cattle Wealth\n\nThe BJP recognises the fact that from times immemorial, cow-\nprotection has remained one of the basics of Indian culture and\nIndian agriculture, and it is on the patient back of the cow and its\nprogeny that the entire structure of Indian agriculture rests. Over\nseventy million animals are employed in farming operations in\nIndian villages, more than eighty percent rural transport needs are\nmet by the bullock-cart. Cow and its progeny continue to be the\nmajor source of power, manure and fuel, including bio-gas. Cow\nis also an effective protection against environmental degradation.\n\nThe BJP regretfully observes that about three million cows are\nslaughtered every year, most of them for export. The party would\nput a total ban on the slaughter of cows. It will\n\n1. Amend article 48 of Constitution to cover bulls and bullocks,\n\nUntitled-10 330 11/7/2016 11:19:45 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 331\n\nand prohibit all trading (state as well as private) in the\nslaughter of cows;\n\n2. Implement a policy of Go-Samvardhan or development\nof cow and cattle-breeding, including the improvement of\nsheep and goat breeds, to bring about a White Revolution\nin the country; and\n\n3. Provide tax exemption to the income of Goshalas and\nPinjarapoles.\n\nIndustrial Policy\n\nIndustry in India has to be much more productive and\ninnovative to be able to fulfill its main role viz provide employment\nin increasing numbers and inputs to other sectors, including\nagriculture. It has also to earn foreign exchange competition with\nthe rest of the world and create resources for overall growth. The\nBJP promises healthy investment environment so that entrepreneurs\nfind domestic market more attractive and challenging.\n\nThe following four main principles will characterise the\nindustrial policy of the BJP\u2014\n\nA. Self-reliance:\n\nThe party regards self-reliance as an over-riding component\nin our external economic relations, including the import of capital\nand technology. We will keep multinationals out of consumer\nindustries.\n\nB. Modernisation:\n\nBJP believes in a modern and progressive India. Open to new\nideas, no matter where they come from provided they suit our\nrequirements and ethos. We will not allow technology to degrade\nman. Our people with their intelligence, industry and character\nare the true and abiding wealth of India.\n\nC. Decentralisation:\n\nThere is far too much power concentrated in the Government,\nand it must be decentralised. The party stands for political as well\nas economic democracy as also for an open society, where the\ngovernment has only an indicative and not a commanding role. It\nwill not be necessary for people to come to Delhi and waste time\n\nUntitled-10 331 11/7/2016 11:19:45 PM\n\f\n332 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nand money over licences and other clearances.\n\nD. Daridra Narayan Sewa:\n\nConsistent with the above three principles, the party will aim\nat securing to every Indian citizen a minimum of material welfare\nin terms of food, clothing, shelter, health and education.\n\nThe BJP pledges to:\n\n1. Debureaucratise the industry, cut down the plethora of\ncontrols which have mushroomed over the years, and which\nbreed corruption and dampen enterprise. We will clear\nprojects promptly and quickly. Industrial Development and\nRegulations Act will be replaced by Industrial Development\nAct;\n\n2. Reconsider the role of the public sector in the light of its\ncontribution to development and society and draw up\nfirm guidelines for its re-organisation into a more efficient,\nproductive, profitable and people-oriented sector;\n\n3. Improve the efficiency and profitability of crucial Public\nSector Units like Railways, oil and gas production, ports,\nNuclear Energy, Defence, etc. through better management;\n\n4. Encourage people\u2019s initiative in Public Sector Units\ninvolving trading, hotels, tourism, consumer goods, etc.,\nby offering them to the public in capital market with\nappropriate safeguards;\n\n5. Foster Swadeshi spirit in every economic and industrial\nactivity and reduce the country\u2019s dependence on foreign\ncountries and foreign agencies. Foreign capital will be\nencouraged in high-tech, import substitution and strictly\nexport oriented areas. Within the set guidelines clearance\nwill be given with minimum paperwork;\n\n6. Promote agro-based industries;\n\n7. Apply MRTP to business houses with assets value crossing\nRs. 1,000 crore and more; or with more than one-third of\nthe market share;\n\n8. Encourage research and development as part of the process\nof industrial growth and over-all modernisation;\n\n9. Encourage businessmen to function as trustees of the\n\nUntitled-10 332 11/7/2016 11:19:45 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 333\n\npublic good;\n\n10. Hazardous industries will be allowed to set up at safe\ndistance. Separate industrial satellites would be set up\nexclusively for such units;\n\n11. Protect our Economic Sovereignty and ensure that the\nexisting Patent laws, which safeguard Indian national\ninterest, remain intact under any external pressure;\n\n12. Small-scale sector will be given due importance and\nencouragement. We shall set up agencies to help small-\nscale industry which will help in purchasing raw materials\nand selling finished goods;\n\n13. BJP government will evolve national management cadre.\nBoth public sector as well as private sector will draw their\nrequirements from this cadre; and\n\n14. While conducive environment will be created to strengthen\ncapital market adequate measures will be taken to safe-\nguard interests of small equity holders.\n\nHandicrafts & Village Industries: To Play Pivotal Role\n\nBJP firmly believes that national goals such as employment\ngeneration, export earnings could be met through our ancient\ncraftmanship such as handloom & handicrafts, gems & jewelry\netc. For instance, investment of Rs. one crore in village industries\ncreates job opportunities for 202 persons while the same investment\nin organised industrial sector can provide job to only 48 persons.\nBesides, more than 40 per cent of our export earnings comes from\nthese so called smaller initiatives. BJP pledges to recognise their\nimportance in the national economy and look at them with enhanced\nexpectations.\n\n1. A separate ministry will be set up to look after interests\nof Handicrafts and village industries.\n\n2. To preserve and promote native craftsmanship \u2018National\nArtisan Development Bank\u2019 would be set up. Government\nwould contribute the necessary initial capital of this bank.\n\n3. These native artisans will be made to feel proud of\nthemselves with due recognition in the society. Attempt\nwill be made to bring them together under cluster of\n\nUntitled-10 333 11/7/2016 11:19:46 PM\n\f\n334 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nartisans.\n\n4. Native Artisans such a weavers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths,\ncarpenters, shoemakers, potters etc. Will be provided with\nbasic amenities such as housing.\n\n5. Processing units, marketing facilities, marketing consultancy\netc. will be provided so that native artisans will get\nremunerative returns for their special skill, which at present\nis exploited by middlemen.\n\n6. Similarly skill of tribal people will receive special attention.\n\n7. In government media such as T.V., native products of\nartisans will get adequate coverage without fees.\n\nFiscal Reform\nThe current economic mess is a direct consequence of the\nmismanagement of the economy by the government. While the\ngovernment controls everyone and everything, nobody seems\nto control the government. BJP believes that the government too\nmust function within the limits of strict financial discipline\u2014on\nthe following lines\n(i) The Government must live within its means. Revenue\nBudgetary Deficits will be reduced to Zero and fiscal\ndeficits will be brought down from 9 per cent to 5 per\ncent of Gross Domestic Product. BJP believes in imposing\na statutory ceiling on budget deficits in order to restrain\ngovernment spending;\n(ii) At present the Reserve Bank has structural autonomy. BJP\nGovt. will ensure operational autonomy of RBI:\n1. BJP will adopt firm and bold measures to prevent\nthe generation of black money. It will also appoint a\nTaxation Inquiry Commission to suggest guidelines\nfor taxation over a long-term period in line with future\ndevelopments;\n2.

Non-developmental expenditure will be curtailed\ndrastically; and\n12. Take stringent measures against smugglers and other\neconomic offenders. Make smuggling a non-bailable\noffence and appoint special courts to try such cases.\n\nPrice Stability and Consumer Protection\n\nIt is our firm belief that price level could be controlled only\nthrough minimisation of production and minimisation of cost of\nproduction through technology upgradation.\n\nBesides, by abolishing deficits on Revenue account and\ncutting capital account deficits to half, the BJP will end inflation\nand stabilise prices. Additionally\n\n1. Public distribution system would be streamlined so that\n\nneedy sections of the society would have access to essential\ncommodities at nominal prices. Under the present system,\npoorest section is forced to buy essential items from open\nmarket. Poor daily wage earners who have to make their\npurchases at the end of the day cannot afford purchases\nonce in a fortnight or so. Public distribution system will\nbe overhauled to help these sections;\n\n2. Make not only grains, sugar and kerosene, but also pulses,\n\ncooking oil and soap available in these shops;\n\n3. Enforce the Consumer Protection Act of 1986, specially\n\nby constituting Consumers\u2019 Courts in all districts; and\n\nUntitled-10 335 11/7/2016 11:19:46 PM\n\f\n336 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n4. Build a powerful consumer movement and formulate\na price and profit policy for industrially manufactured\ngoods.\n\nEmployment Policy\nThe BJP recognises the citizen\u2019s Right to Work in principle.\nWe shall make every endeavour to accomplish its objectives. Our\nmany developmental policies that will nearly double the Growth\nRate, will take good care of unemployment \u2014\n1. Launch Employment Guarantee Scheme throughout the\ncountry in a phased manner;\n2. Introduce a contributory Family Pension Scheme to cover\nparticularly the daily wage earner; and\n3. Implement Antyodaya Scheme to serve the poorest in the\nland.\n\nLabour\n\nBJP believes in healthy trade unionism. It will\n\n1. Rationalise and simplify Labour Laws;\n\n2. Recognise unions on the basis of secret ballot;\n\n3. Introduce worker participation from the Shop Floor to the\nBoard Room in all public sector projects, public limited\ncompanies and foreign companies operating in India;\n\n4. Protect workers against inflation; and\n\n5. Make laws, and evolve an effective mechanism, to protect\nlabour from occupational health hazards arising from\nindustries like asbestos, cement, slate, mica chemicals,\ntextiles, etc.\n\nGovernment Employees\nBJP will set up a permanent Employees Welfare Board witha\nview to resolving the long-standing problems related to\u2014\n1. Time Scale Promotion;\nImplementation of Awards;\nRecruitment avenues;\nHousing;\nRevision of Pay Scales and award of bonus; and\n\nAIF WN\n\nSocial welfare measures and travel concession for retired\n\nUntitled-10 336 11/7/2016 11:19:46 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 337\n\npersonnel.\n\nEnergy Policy\n\nThere is acute energy crisis in India, particularly in villages\nwhich have remained without any dependable source of energy\neven after forty four years of Independence. This situation will\nhave to be tackled on a war footing. BJP will\n\n1. Intensify efforts to find more oil, coal and natural gas\nreserves, and economise on their use;\n\n2. Improve the working of power plants which are now\nfunctioning at less than 50 per cent of capacity; Stop the\nmassive theft of electric power;\n\n4. Introduce power-efficient, energy-saving devices in homes\nand factories;\n\n5. Increase forest cover from the present 19 per cent of land\nto the desired 33 per cent;\n\n6. Encourage Private Sector\u2019s participation in power\ngeneration; and\n\n7. Encourage alternative sources of energy such as wind,\nwater, biogas, solar power and ocean thermal energy\nconversion.\n\nTransport Policy\n\n1. Speedy movement of goods and people will receive\nutmost attention. In this regard, the whole country will\nbe considered as a single zone.\n\n2. Metropolitan cities like Delhi will be provided with better\ntransport system;\n\n3. Public Transport system will be improved so as to attract\nmarginal personal vehicle owners. This will help to reduce\ndemand for energy. Simultaneously, environmental\npollution could be controlled;\n\n4. Utmost attention will be paid towards development of\nInter modal Transport System. This would mean integrated\ndevelopment of all modes of transport such as roads and\nroad transport, railways, ports and shipping;\n\n5. Inland water transport system will be fully tapped; and\n\n6. Air transport system will be overhauled not only to\n\nUntitled-10 337 11/7/2016 11:19:47 PM\n\f\n338 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nimprove operational efficiency but also to take care of\nsafety elements. Entrepreneurs will be encouraged to come\nforward in air transport.\n\nForeign Trade and Balance of Payments\n\nUnder the current balance of payments crisis foreign trade plays\nan important role. Export promotion and Import rationalisation\nwill receive due attention of BJP government \u2014\n\n1. Thrust would be given to promotion of exports and intensive\neffort would be made to identify alternative markets and\nalso thrust commodities;\n\n2. Required infrastructural support would be provided on\npriority basis to export oriented units;\n\n3. At the same time import would be rationalised and\nrestricted to those items which are absolutely essential;\n\n4. Corporate sector would have to fulfill its export obligation\nspecially if its production is import intensive;\n\n5. Balance of trade would have to be maintained on unit by\nunit basis. Right now, performance of the corporate sector\nis not satisfactory in this respect;\n\n6. Under-invoicing of exports and over-invoicing of imports\nwill be strictly dealt with;\n\n7. Excellence in export performance will receive special\nrecognition;\n\n8. It is estimated that 12 million Indians settled in over 100\ncountries save around 100 billion U.S. dollars a year.\nScheme would be drawn to attract substantial portion of\nthese savings;\n\n9. NRIs would be welcome to set up Industrial units. \u2018Science\nBased Industrial Parks\u2019 would be set up which would\ncater of the NRIs not only with regard to infrastructural\nfacilities required for their industrial units but would\nalso be complete with basic amenities such as education,\nhousing, health care and entertainment. This would help\nus to raise resources as well as reversing the brain-drain;\n\n10. The present principle of linking Indian rupee to basket of\ncurrencies will be re-examined; and\n11. Tourism will get special attention.\n\nUntitled-10 338 11/7/2016 11:19:47 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 339\n\nScience And Technology\n\nThe BJP believes that Science and Technology (S & T) should\nbe allowed to play its due role to transform India into a prosperous,\nmodern and enlightened society. The party would unhesitatingly\napply appropriate scientific and technological methods for increasing\nproductivity, eradicating poverty, hunger and disease and to provide\nmeaningful employment along with the basic amenities of life to\nthe vast percentage of population living below the poverty line.\nThe party holds that science is not merely harnessing nature for\nmaterial wealth but is as well liberating and enriching mind and\nenlarging the human spirit. The BJP would use science in the service\nof the poor and would develop technology with a human face \u2014\n\n1. Foster a scientific temper among the people;\n\n2. Use Science and Technology for increasing productivity\nand generating employment;\n\n3. Implement a vigorous programme of science education\nand research for improving quality of life;\n\n4.

Put new life in National Laboratories. develop them as\ncentres of excellence in applied research;\n\n6. Direct these laboratories to evolve Appropriate Technology\nfor Indian needs;\n\n7. Accelerate the production of scientific literature in regional\nlanguages and evolve a national terminology for science\nand technology; and\n\n8. Create the right working conditions, for our best brains\nto remain here and serve the country and not migrate to\nother lands.\n\nA systematised effort would be made to bring national\nlaboratories and industry together by setting up of \u2018Technology\nParks\u2019 which would be maintained by the industry. They would\nhelp to bridge the gap between talents and commercial needs and\npromote co-operation between industry\u2019s resources and expertise\nin labs.\n\nUntitled-10 339 11/7/2016 11:19:47 PM\n\f\n340 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nTowards a Vibrant Social Order\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party looks upon the people of India as\ntrue wealth and strength of the country.\n\nSince the majority of people of India live in the cluster of\nvillages, BJP will give special attention to their welfare and progress.\nTo this end we will\n\n1. Carry water and electricity to every village;\n2. Connect all villages to national centres of activities by\nroad transport;\n\n. Upgrade village health and educational centres;\n\n.

Promote Rs. 100 crore a year cottage industry to employ\nrural women.\n\nYouth\n\nThe BJP has a tryst with the Youth of India. They will be\nthe fly-wheel of national progress. Apart from organising their\neducation and full employment, BJP will\n\nUntitled-10 341 11/7/2016 11:19:48 PM\n\f\n342 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n1. Utilise their energies to transform society;\n\nN\n\nAssociate them in all developmental activities;\n\n3. Mobilise them to fight social evils like child marriage,\ndowry, untouchability, drug-addiction;\n\n4. Build more Youth hostels; and\n\n5. Inculcate in them a sense of pride in our traditions and\n\nheritage and confidence in our future.\n\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\nThe BJP sincerely believes with all its heart in the upliftment\nof SC and ST. To this end we will\n\n1. Energetically enforce anti-untouchability laws;\n\n2. Make free legal aid available to SC in cases under these\nlaws;\n\n3. Make all village wells available to all castes and\ncommunities;\n\n4. Set up a financial agency on the line of NABARD to cater\nto the credit needs of SC & ST;\n\n5.

Formulate a sub-plan for the economic development of\nScheduled Tribes; and\n\n10. Remove all impediments in the speedy development of\n\nhill and forest tribal areas.\n\nOther Backward Castes\n\nThe BJP is pledged to the socio-economic uplift of Other\nBackward Castes particularly the more backward among them.\nBJP in its 1985 resolution and subsequently in its 1989 Election\nManifesto commended the following reservation policy:\n\n1. Reservation should be continued for the Scheduled Castes\n\nand Scheduled Tribes as before;\n2. Reservation should also be made for other backward classes\n\nUntitled-10 342 11/7/2016 11:19:48 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 343\n\nbroadly on the basis of the Mandal Commission Report,\nwith preference to be given to the poor among these very\nclasses; and\n\n3. As poverty is an important contributory factor for\n\nbackwardness, reservation should also be provided for\nmembers of the other castes on the basis of their economic\ncondition.\n\nIn view of the shocking manner in which the National Front\ngovernment implemented the Mandal Commission Report which\nresulted in self-immolation of youths and pitted caste against\ncaste and community against community. BJP feels that the\nreservation policy should be introduced taking into consideration\nsocio-economic ethos. Reservation policy should be used as an\ninstrument of social justice and promoting social harmony as well.\nThe question of reservation has to be viewed with open mind free\nfrom all prejudices of any kind.\n\nIn addition BJP\n\n1. Will start a chain of first class residential schools where\nthe really bright children of really poor families of all\ncastes and communities will be admitted, educated and\notherwise looked after, to come into their own and enter\nServices, Business and Professions in open competition;\n\n2. Most of the non-agricultural OBCs are artisans. Foreign\nand metropolitan competition has hurt these people badly.\nBJP will train and equip them, so that they can find a place\nof honour in the new social economy.\n\nThe Destitute and Handicapped\n\nBJP will not forget the destitute and the handicapped. It will\nnot allow anybody to starve. Antyodaya Scheme will take care of\ndestitutes. We will encourage people to set up institutions for the\ncare of the physically handicapped and mentally retarded and\nmake certain jobs available for them.\n\nPopulation Policy\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party believes in a stable growth of\nthe Population \u2014 and the quality, physcial and mental, of that\n\nUntitled-10 343 11/7/2016 11:19:48 PM\n\f\n344 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nPopulation. We will, therefore \u2014\n\n1. Adopta National Population Policy, if necessary through\nlegislative measures;\n\n2. Make Family Planning information and facilities available\nto the people. Involve all voluntary, social and cultural\norganisations in creating an awareness for adopting family\nplanning as a way of life;\n\n3. Integrate the family planning programme with other\ncommunity welfare programmes; and\n\n4. Pursue vigorously the voluntary adaptation of the\n\u2018two children\u2019 norm through adequate incentives and\ndisincentives for achieving the long term demographic\ngoals.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party takes serious note of the degradation\nof the environment and disturbance of the eco-system. The pollution\nof air, water and soil are a serious menace to health. The denudation\nof forests, the warming up of the earth, acid rain and the \u2018hole in\nthe sky\u2019 are a threat to the whole life-system itself. We in India\nhave always looked upon the earth as Divine Mother.\n\nOur land, air and waters, our hills, forests, flora and fauna, are\n\nall sacred to us. We will keep them neat, clean and intact. We will\n\n1. Formulate a National Resources Management Policy and\nadopt a holistic approach in planning;\n\n2. Require anti-pollution devices to be installed to process\nand clean up industrial and Municipal effluents before\nthe same are discharged into our rivers;\n\n3.

Make environmental concerns an integral part of education;\n\nND OS\n\nand\n9. Take special care in the import of technology, and promote\n\nUntitled-10 344 11/7/2016 11:19:48 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 345\n\nresearch, for developing indigenous pollution-free\ntechnology.\n\nCulture\nThe BJP believes in protecting, preserving and promoting the\ncultural heritage of India that has given us an identity, an integrity\nand an aura all our own.

Not ban any publication without a prior judicial review.\n\nArts\nArt is the essence of life. BJP will encourage all forms of art. It\nwill make the various arts a part of Education, Production and Life.\n1. To promote the theatre BJP will repeal the Restrictive\nDramatic Performance Act of 1876; and\n2. Exempt all theatrical performances from entertainment\ntax; Encourage folk art in various fields; Lift the AIR and\nTV ban on the use of classical symbols like Om, Swastika,\nSri chakra, etc.\n\nFilms\nBJP recognises the great role of cinema in entertainment,\neducation and national integration. BJP will\n1. Have, in addition to\u2019A\u2019 and \u2018U\u2019 Films, \u2018Q\u2019 that is Quality\nfilms, which will be exempt from entertainment tax;\n2.

India abounds in natural beauty and charming tourist\nspots, which have fascinated people from far and wide. We will\n1. Promote tourism, both national and international, as an\nindustry;\n2. Evolve a policy of integrating tourism and marketing of\nhandicrafts and other art works;\n3. Take up a scheme of training tourist guides and opening\ntourist information centres; and\n4. Build Holiday Homes in the hills, on sea beaches and at\npilgrim centres.\n\nMass Media\n\nThe BJP re-affirms its commitment to the freedom of thought\n\nand expression. We will\n\n1. Make freedom of the Press an explicit Fundamental Right,\nand not just an implied one, derived from the citizen\u2019s\nright to Freedom of Speech;\n\n2.

He must also have health and\nfaith, housing and education, sport and a wholesome environment.\n\nHousing\n\nBJP will adopt all policies necessary to make it possible for\nevery family to own a house. To this end it will\n\n1. Make land available to cooperative group housing societies;\n\n2. Encourage employers, private and public, to build houses\nfor their employees;\n\nBuild low-cost model houses in villages;\n\n4. Clear slum areas and build multi-storey buildings on the\nspot to house their present residents;\n\n5. Rationalise Rent Control Laws to encourage housing\nconstruction and house renting;\n\n6. Stamp duties and such other formalities will be rationalised\nso as to encourage low and middle income classes to own\ndwelling units; and\n\n7.

The BJP believes in equalisation\nof educational opportunities and build up a system worthy of the\ngenius of our heritage and the undoubted capacities of our youth.\nTowards this end, we will\n1. Implement Article 45 of the Constitution to give free\neducation to all children in the 6-14 age group to enforce\nthe principle of universal primary education;\n2. Give education a vocational and technical content, establish\na complex of agro-industrial polytechnics in each district;\n3. Ensure academic freedom and the autonomy of universities,\nraise the emoluments and status of teachers; and\n4. Progressively increase the allocation for education till it\nreaches the six percent of the GNP.\n\nLanguage\n\nUntitled-10 347 11/7/2016 11:19:49 PM\n\f\n348 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nThe BJP supports the principle that people have a right to\nbe educated and run their administration in their own language.\nThe BJP will\n\n1. Engage adequate number of linguists all over the country\nto translate standard literature of other languages into\nIndian languages;\n\n2. Strictly implement three languages formula;\n\n3.

Ban amniocentesis - sex determination tests - often leading\nto female foeticide.\n\nSports\nBJP will encourage sports as the way of health, strength and\nthe sheer joy of living. We will put India on the Olympic map of\nthe world. We will\n1. Create a Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Sports;\n2. Help every school to have a playground;\n3.

Respect the Olympic Charter and autonomy of the\nSports bodies and prevent the governmentalisation or\npoliticisation of Sports.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 349 11/7/2016 11:19:49 PM\n\f\nTowards World Fraternity\n\nIn four decades of Freedom, India has had to face as many as\nfour aggressions against our territory. This is, in all conscience, a\nhigh degree of challenge to our territorial integrity and national\nsovereignty, with its consequential strains on the Indian Economy,\nthe Indian Polity and the Indian society.\n\nDiplomacy\n\nLike India, the world is also at cross roads. With the sudden\ndisappearance of bipolar divide of 45 years, the USSR and the US\nare no longer adversaries but partners. Curtain has finally been\ndrawn over the cold war that has dominated the world for most\nof the current century.\n\nInternational equations are changing fast. In the post cold\nwar period, neither the USA needs the third world countries to\ncontain communism nor does the USSR has any use now for its\n\u2018natural allies\u2019 in the developing world. As a result. non-alignment\nmovement which was created against the backdrop of a bipolar\nworld, has lost its relevance.\n\nThe new situation is a challenging one and at the same time\npregnant with several fresh opportunities to enlarge India\u2019s role in\nglobal affairs. But only economically healthy, militarily strong and\nprogressive India can carve out a niche for itself. As long as India\ngoes around with a begging bowl around the world, her voice in\nthe international affairs will not be heard with respect.\n\nPrevention is always better than cure. That Defence is best\nthat does not need to be invoked too often to defend our legitimate\nnational interests. And that, in turn calls for wise and integrated\nDomestic,, Economic and Foreign Polices. In the past, our foreign\n\nUntitled-10 350 11/7/2016 11:19:49 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 351\n\npolicy has suffered from inconsistencies. At times we have treated it\nas an exercise in verbal gymnastics and used it as a feather in a Prime\nMinister\u2019s cap. At other times we have treated it - as was the case\nonly recently with the Gulf War \u2014 as a football, for irresponsible\nparties to kick it around. We are sorry to note that Foreign Policy\ndiscussion and formulation has not been institutionalised in India.\nAs a result the performance of our diplomacy has been spotty at best.\n\nPakistan and China continue to occupy territories lawfully\nours. Thousands of Tibetans continue to live in India as refugees.\nThe Pakistan Establishment is hostile, and even the Bangladesh\nEstablishment has been less than friendly. The situation in\nAfghanistan has fortunately stabilised. But the situation in Sri\nLanka is as disturbed as ever, with serious violence erupting on\nboth sides of the Palk straits. Burmans next door continue to suffer\ndictatorship. And Indians abroad continue to suffer discrimination\nin many lands.\n\nThe BJP is wedded to National interest and World Peace. To\n\nthese ends we will\n\n1. Set up a Policy Planning Committee of experts to formulate\na long-term Foreign Policy for India;\n\n2. Forge a national Consensus on Foreign Policy issues;\n\n3. Work for a stronger SAARC in view of the old bipolar\nworld giving place to a uni-polar World;\n\n4. Invite Pakistan to come forward to resolve out disputes\nin terms of the Shimla Pact and meanwhile develop\ncooperative economic and media relations;\n\n5. Promote the idea of aCommon Market of all SAARC states;\n\n6. Constitute a South Asian Environmental Protection\nAuthority, with representation from non-governmental\nenvironmentalists from all concerned countries;\n\n7. Continue the North-South Dialogue and promote South-\nSouth cooperation;\n\n8. Develop friendly and cordial relations with the countries\nof South-East Asia, with whom we have ancient bonds of\nblood and culture;\n\n9. Stand by persons of Indian origin abroad in defence of\ntheir legitimate rights;\n\nUntitled-10 351 11/7/2016 11:19:50 PM\n\f\n352 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\n10. Give Dual Citizenship to Indian citizens abroad; and\n\n11. Strive to strengthen United Nations in view of the fact\nin the changed situation the world powers are more\ninclined to work-through the UN than unilaterally or even\nthrough older groups and factions. Strive to make India an\nautonomous power centre in the world with a permanent\nseat in the U.N. Security Council.\n\nDefence\nDiplomacy and Defence are two sides of the same coin, that is\n\na country\u2019s relation with the outside world. A sound Foreign Policy\n\nwill give us a secure base for a sound Defence policy. However,\n\nrecent events have shown that international relations continue\nto be governed by the law of the jungle. The way Iraq occupied\n\nKuwait and USA exceeded the UN resolutions to bring death and\n\ndestruction to both Kuwait and Iraq is a warning that we cannot\n\nafford to neglect our Defence. The BJP will\n1. Encourage an educated debate on national strategy as a\nroute to national security strategy;\n2. Set up a National Security Council to institutionalize\nforward planning;\n\nGive our Defence Forces Nuclear Teeth;\n\n4. Give ourselves a Blue Water Navy that will be the first\nNavy in the Indian Ocean from Singapore to Aden;\n\n5. Encourage Research and further Development on\nArjun Battle Tank, Light Combat Aircraft, Army Radio\nEngineering Network (AREN) and Prithvi and other\nmissiles developed by Dr. Abdul Kalam;\n\n6. Identify and eliminate foreign lobbies engaged in arms\ntrade;\n\n7. Effect economic even while improving Defence capability;\n\n8. Avoid unnecessary duplication and merge paramilitary\nforces like BSF, Assam Rifles, Indo-Tibetan Border Police\nwith the Army and the Coast Guard with the Navy; and\n\n9. Liberalise the Official Secret Act to facilitate an intelligent\ndebate on defence.\n\n\u00bb\n\nUntitled-10 352 11/7/2016 11:19:50 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 353\n\nInvite\n\nThis then is the programme which the BJP pledges to implement\nunder a team of inspiring and brilliant leaders and dedicated\ncadres of the party of impeccable record of clean public life and\nselfless service to the nation. The party is committed to usher ina\nnew political culture.\n\nIndia today is in the grip of a serious multi-dimensional crisis\nof unprecedented proportions. The national mood is not just of\ncynicism but of mounting disgust and rage, not unmixed with\nsorrow at the steady deterioration in public morality at the topmost\nleadership level.

The country cannot afford to miss this moment of\nhistory, this opportunity to throw out the rulers mainly responsible\nfor this country\u2019s ruination.\n\nThe BJP on its part has left no stone unturned in its efforts\nto put up a determined and united electoral battle and has\nunhesitatingly sacrificed its party interests whenever national\ninterests so demanded. The Bharatiya Janata Party calls upon the\npeople to join in its struggle for ushering in a new era of hope and\nprosperity, a value based polity and throw out this corrupt and\nincompetent Congress.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 353 11/7/2016 11:19:50 PM\n\f\nUntitled-10 354 11/7/2016 11:19:50 PM\n\f\nElection Manifesto\n\n1989\n\n \n\f\nUntitled-10 356 11/7/2016 11:19:50 PM\n\f\nIntroduction\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party is wedded to the Unity and Integrity\nof India. It stands for Law and Order - for Justice, Social and\nEconomic and for Security, Internal and External. It is committed\nto the uplift of the poor and the downtrodden. But BJP is sorry to\nnote that the Rajiv Government has disappointed the country on\nall these counts.\n\nIndia today is in the grip of a serious multidimensional crisis\nof unprecedented proportions. The national mood is not just of\ncynicism but of mounting disgust and rage, not unmixed with\nsorrow, at the steady deterioration in public morality at the topmost\nleadership level. The people feel sad that through an accident of\nhistory this great country should have been saddled with a coterie\nof small men who are not only incompetent and corrupt, but who\nlack a sense of commitment to the nation, its democratic institutions\nand cultural traditions.\n\nEvidence \u2018is mounting that the Prime Minister, whose personal\nprobity is now in serious doubt, has not only been bending words\nbut telling lies, distorting facts, changing versions, elbowing \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nministers of integrity and unabashedly misleading the Parliament\nand the Nation even on crucial issues of national defence and\nsecurity. The men at the top are not only without integrity but also\nwithout shame. In any other country, such a government would\nhave resigned long ago. But it is continuing in office and trying\nto subvert the democratic process by resorting to fascist methods,\nincluding mugging of the press, instigation of communal riots and\nsubversion of the judiciary.\n\nStark failure faces the country on all fronts. Accords have ended\n\nUntitled-10 357 11/7/2016 11:19:50 PM\n\f\n358 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nup in bloody discords. The Rajiv regime is bathed in blood and\nmuck from head to foot, from Punjab to, Assam and from Kashmir\nto Sri Lanka. Everything Rajiv Gandhi touches ends up ina bloody\nmess. A man who waded to his office through the blood-soaked\nstreets of Delhi will be leaving behind a gory legacy. This country\nis not safe in the hands of such a man or such a party. How can\nmen who lack integrity themselves, and are not above looting the\ncountry, defend the country and protect its integrity and honour?\n\nThe power and prestige of great institutions like the Parliament,\nthe Army and the Judiciary have been eroded; the press has been\nrepeatedly threatened and harassed; and the electronic media have\nbeen prostituted. The directive principles of state policy have been\nforgotten; the Mandal Report on the welfare of backward classes\nhas been pigeonholed; and never before has Indian womanhood\nsuffered insult and assault as during the last five years.\n\nBy negativing the Supreme Court judgment in the Shahabano\ncase, the government has put a premium on communalism and\nobscurantism. And by recognising Urdu as second official language\nin Uttar Pradesh on election eve, it has shown more interest in\nMuslim votes than in Urdu language. In the process it has only\ngiven the country so many corpses. By not allowing the rebuilding\nof the Ram Janma Mandir in Ayodhya, on the lines of Somnath\nMandir built by the Government of India in 1948, it has allowed\ntensions to rise, and gravely strained social harmony.\n\nAbout the situation on the economic front, the less said the\nbetter. During the last five years, prices have doubled and in many\ncases trebled; unemployment has soared by leaps and bounds and\nnational debt increased three times. And all this while the country\nhas been thrown open for plunder by foreign interests who are\ntaking out more from the country than they ever put in. The country\nhas paid out more to foreigners in the last five years than the entire\ndebt of farmers which the government refuses to write off.\n\nIn this enveloping darkness, the Bharatiya Janata Party stands\nas a beacon of light. It is wedded to Desh and Dharma, Samata and\nSamanvay. It stands for justice - social and economic - for all, for\nthe Kisan and the Jawan, for the young and the old, for the poor\nand the downtrodden, for women and children, irrespective of\nclass, creed or gender. It also stands for law and order particularly\n\nUntitled-10 358 11/7/2016 11:19:51 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 359\n\nmoral order, for without such an order, the country cannot endure\nand flourish.\n\nBJP rejects both exploitative capitalism and suppressive\ncommunism. Its approach to life and society, as expounded by our\nlate Pt. Deendayal Upadhyay, is integrative and holistic. It looks\nupon the farmer in the field and the worker in the factory as two\nmighty wheels of our modern Rashtra-rath. It believes that the nation\ncannot progress until those who have remained at the bottom of\nthe social pile for centuries are helped to elevate themselves and\njoin the mainstream on a footing of equality.\n\nBJP believes in positive secularism which, according to our\nconstitution-makers, meant Sarva-Dharma-Sama-Bhava and\nwhich does not connote an irreligious state. It certainly does\nnot mean rejection of our history and cultural heritage, the very\nfoundations of this great nation. The BJP stands for \u2018Justice for All\nand Appeasement of None\u2019.\n\nThis is what we are and this is what we aim to do. Come and\njoin us in the great enterprise of nation-building, in taking this\ncountry to great heights of prosperity and glory. Following is the\nprogramme which the BJP offers to the people for taking India to\nits destiny-a modern, peaceful and prosperous nation on the road\nto an exciting future.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 359 11/7/2016 11:19:51 PM\n\f\nNational Unity and National Integration\n\nIndia is one country, and all Indians irrespective of caste, creed or\nlanguage are one people, one nation.\n\nThe idea of a theocratic state is an anathema to Indian mind\nand the BJP believes that State in India has always been a civil\ninstitution which respects all religions equally and makes no\ndiscrimination between one citizen and the other on the grounds\nof language, gender, caste or religion.\n\nIt is the duty of the State to guarantee justice and security to\nall minorities - linguistic, religious or ethnic. The BJP considers\nthat it is also imperative for national integration that minorities\ndo not develop a minority complex.\n\nIndian Constitution is quasi-federal. It envisages strong States\nwith a strong Centre. The BJP believes in maintaining a balance\nbetween the two as visualised in our Constitution.\n\nThe BJP also recognises that regional imbalances have\ndeveloped in some States because of their size. The party stands\nfor the formation of smaller states which are economically and\nadministratively viable. The BJP will\n\n1. Support and strengthen State Governments and not\n\ndestabilise and topple them;\n\n2. Give the states a fairer share of Central revenues and\n\nincrease the financial powers of the states;\n\n3. Constitute an Inter-State Council under Article 263 to settle\n\nall Inter-State and State-Centre disputes;\n\n4. Appoint State Governors in consultation with State\n\nGovernments;\n5. Limit the number of ministers to 10 per cent of legislators;\n\nUntitled-10 360 11/7/2016 11:19:51 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 361\n\n6. Guarantee to all minorities, linguistic and religious, peace\nand security, and full opportunities for progress and\ndevelopment;\n\n7. Delete the temporary Article 370 of the Constitution and\nscrap the 59th Amendment of the Constitution:,\n\n8. Appoint a Commission to examine the various personal\nlaws in vogue in the country - Hindu Law, Muslim Law,\nChristian Law, Parsi Law, Civil Law etc. and to identify\nthe fair and equitable ingredients in these laws, prepare\na draft with a view to evolving a consensus for a uniform\nCivil Code;\n\n9. Appoint a Commission to examine the Constitution of\nIndia for making it an effective instrument for containing\ncentrifugal tendencies;\n\n10.

The\nparty holds that the roots of all corruption lie in political corruption.\nThe party recognises the urgency of evolving effective mechanism\nto break the unholy nexus between the corrupt bureaucrat, corrupt\nbusinessmen and the corrupt politician. The BJP is determined\nto fight corruption at all levels and will specifically adopt the\nfollowing measures \u2014\n\n1. It will enquire into all cases of corruption in the foreign\ndeals (including the defence deals) by various ministries\nand departments of the Government and punish the\nguilty.\n\n2. It will enact a law, and create institutions of Lokpal and\nLokayukta bringing the P.M. and the Chief Minister also\nunder its purview.\n\n3.

The BJP holds,\nthe Central Government squarely responsible for the neglect of the\nNorth Eastern Region and its unsatisfactory economic development\nand consequent exploitation by the foreign Missionaries.\n\nThe BJP would take following steps to meet the alarming\nsituation in the North East\u2014\n\n1. Setting up of the barbed wire fencing along the Indo-\n\nBangladesh border;\n\n2. Detection of infiltrators and deletion of their names from\nthe voters list on a war footing. Steps will be taken for\ntheir deportation;\n\nIssue identity cards to all citizens in border states;\n\n4.

Implementing a sub-plan for the economic development\nof the Tribals.\n\nPunjab\n\nThe BJP holds the Congress (I) squarely responsible for what is\nhappening in Punjab. Punjab situation continues to deteriorate not\nbecause of any lack of power with the government. The government\nis possessing enormous powers but lacks a policy and a will to act.\n\nThe BJP has always been striving for maintaining social\nharmony in Punjab. Several party leaders including the State BJP\nPresident and other colleagues have laid down their lives in this\ncause.\n\nThe BJP would strive for a fair and peaceful solution of\nthe Punjab problem. It would adopt the following approach for\ncontaining terrorism in Punjab\u2014\n\n1. Creation of a security belt all along the Western borders\n\nwith Pakistan without delay;\n\n2. Secure the assistance of Army to help the civil administration\nin the Mand area, if need be;\n\n3. Strengthen the intelligence apparatus;\n\n4. Punishing those who were responsible for the killings of\ninnocents in Delhi and elsewhere after the assassination\nof Mrs Gandhi;\n\n5. Adequately compensating the victims of violence; and\n\n6. Review the structural changes in the economy of Punjab\nand to remove the distortions.\n\nJammu And Kashmir And The Western\nThe BJP views with concern the recent developments in the State\nof Jammu and Kashmir and the continued discrimination against the\npeople of Jammu. The rabid communal and pro-Pakistan elements are\nspearheading a massive hate India campaign in Kashmir valley and\nthe entire region is engulfed by widespread terrorism. The unabated\ninfiltration and smuggling all along the western border needs to be\neffectively curbed. The BJP suggests that\u2014\n1. Effective and immediate measures to weed out the\nforeigners from Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan and\nGujarat be taken;\n\nUntitled-10 364 11/7/2016 11:19:52 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 365\n\n2. Border with Pakistan should be effectively guarded by\ncreating a security belt to stop infiltration of trained\nterrorists and smuggling of arms and ammunition, narcotics\nand other contraband commodities; and\n\n3. A Regional Council for Jammu be formed so that regional\n12 imbalances in development be removed.\n\nLaw and Order and Protection of Weaker Sections\nThe BJP views with alarm the rise of social violence in the\ncountry. This includes communal violence, atrocities on Scheduled\nCastes and Tribals, and criminal assaults on women. The BJP\nbelieves that the weaker sections need an effective protection from\natrocities and the Party is committed to the security of life, limb,\nproperty and honour of all citizens. In case of a serious eruption\nof violence, the BJP commends that \u2014\n1. A judicial inquiry will always be held;\n2. The inquiry report will be published;\n3. Those guilty of incitement to violence or dereliction of\nduty will be punished;\n4. Allsufferers will be suitably compensated and rehabilitated;\n5. An indepth socio-economic study of riot-prone areas to\ntake effective steps for riot-prevention will be conducted;\n6. The Police Force be transformed into an efficient\nand impartial instrument of law and order, through\nmodernisation programme and better service conditions;\nand\n7. Political meddling in police work be stopped and a\nmachinery for redressal of Police/ People\u2019s griveances be\ncreated.\n\nJustice and Judicial Reforms\nThe BJP believes that without an independent judiciary, it\nis impossible to have the Rule of Law. Also the judicial system\nshould be speedy, inexpensive and just. The BJP would under-take\nthe following measures to restore the independence, integrity and\nefficiency of the judicial system \u2014\n1. Take effective measures to provide free legal aid to the\npoor and specially the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and\n\nUntitled-10 365 11/7/2016 11:19:52 PM\n\f\n366 * Party Document Vol-1\n\ngradual abolition of the Court-fees;\n\n2. Simplify the legal procedures and increase the number of\njudges so that majority of the cases are disposed of within\none year;\n\n3. Provide mobile courts for the rural areas and set up Nyaya\nPanchayats with judicial powers;\n\n4. Offer better service conditions and emoluments to judges\nat all levels;\n\n5. The Chief Justice of India should have the final say in the\nappointment of the High Court and Supreme Court Judges\nto be recommended by an independent body;\n\n6. Raise the retirement age of judges to 65, give them full\npension equal to their salary, prohibit them from holding\nany office after retirement;\n\n7. Appoint a Commission for suggesting an overhaul of the\nJudicial System which is under serious stress;\n\n8. Appoint special courts for different categories of cases so\nthat pending cases in various High Courts and Supreme\nCourt are cleared within one year; and\n\n9. Introduce social security measures like provident fund\nand group insurance schemes for the advocates.\n\nDecentralisation of Power and Panchayati Raj\n\nThe Panchayat System formed the bedrock of the democratic\nfunctioning of the Indian Social System since the Vedic period.\nMahatma Gandhi and Jay Prakash Narayan were strong votaries of\nlocal self-government. The Jana Sangh under the leadership of Pt.\nDeendayal Upadhyay had always canvassed for the Constitutional\nstatus of the Panchayats and Municipal boards.\n\nThe BJP believes in decentralisation of power and strengthening\nof democracy at the grass roots.\n\nThe party ensures a Constitutional status to the Panchayats\nand other local self institution and assured share of resources so\nthat they do not depend upon discretionary grants.\n\nThe BJP will neither impose Panchayats from above nor will\nuse them to bypass the State Governments. Oo\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 366 11/7/2016 11:19:53 PM\n\f\nNational Economy\n\nThe Indian economy is presently going through an acute crisis.\nIn fact it has been stagnating for the last ten years and more so\nsince 1985. The per capita availability of the items of staple diet\nof the nation, in these years has gone down. The nation is more\nundernourished today than it was a few years ago. As a result of\nwrong plan priorities, the country is producing more colour TV\nsets, but not enough steel, more computers but not enough power,\nmore fancy cars but not enough buses, more superfine fabrics but\nnot enough cheaper varieties of dhoties and saries. The result of this\nlopsided elitist sense of priorities, combined with corruption and\nprofligacy, is that today there are more people looking for jobs than\never before, more landless farmers than ever before, more illiterates\nthan ever before. The consumer is groaning under the burden of\nback-breaking prices. There is more sorrow than happiness, more\npoverty than wealth.\n\nThe BJP hold the ruling party squarely responsible for\ndeliberately neglecting the agriculture sector in pursuit of mythical\nmodernisation.\n\nForty years ago, the disparity between the farmer and his\ncounterpart in other sectors was not very large. Today it is one to\nthree; soon, it will be one to four. A country that treats its farmers\nwith contempt is bound to remain mired in poverty, as India is.\nThe Country is again resorting to imports of foodgrains after so\nmany years, which in itself is a tell-tale commentary on the mess\nthat has been made on the farm front, in fact, in respect of the\nentire economy. Thanks to the wrong policies of our rulers over\nthe years, thousands of crores of rupees from the rural poor have\nbeen transferred to the urban rich, resulting in a colossal rural\n\nUntitled-10 367 11/7/2016 11:19:53 PM\n\f\n368 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nindebtedness. The BJP will reverse all these ugly trends and give\nthe country a humane economy. It will take all steps necessary to\nachieve full employment, maximise production, stabilise prices\nand eradicate poverty and rural indebtedness. For this BJP offers\nthe following programme:\n\nAgriculture\n\nIn the opinion of the BJP the speedy development of the\nagriculture and rural sector is the key to India\u2019s prosperity. The\nparty recognises that more than 65 per cent of Indian farmers are\npoor, they need capital and subsidised inputs for their rapid growth.\nThe Kisan will continue to flounder in poverty unless the burden\nof people depending upon agriculture is reduced. A network of\nagro-industrial complexes in the rural areas is the real answer\nto the problems of poverty of the Indian peasantry. The party is\ncommitted to implement its Charter of Rights of Kisan.\n\nThe BJP offers a new deal to the farmers and it will\u2014\n\n1. Write off the debts of the farmers, agricultural labourers\nand rural artisans;\n\n2. Allocate sixty percent of the plan money, both Central\nand State, for rural development, agricultural and allied\nservices;\n\n3. Ensure remunerative prices to the farmers, computed after\ntaking into consideration all the parameters like cost of\ninputs and living index etc;\n\n4, Ensure minimum wages to farm labour;\n\n5. Maintain parity of prices between agricultural and industrial\nproduce;\n\n6. Remove all restrictions on the movement of agricultural\nproduce throughout the country;\n\n7. Arrange abundant and regular supply of water and energy;\n\n8. Introduce crop and cattle insurance schemes which would\nguarantee adequate compensation in case of crop failure,\ndamage or loss due to natural calamities or outbreak of\nepidemics in cattle; also update the age old famine code;\n\n9. Provide market value compensation in one instalment in\ncase of land acquisition and rehabilitation of the uprooted\nin the process;\n\nUntitled-10 368 11/7/2016 11:19:53 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 369\n\n10. Issue Pass Books to Kisans and implement the land laws;\n\n11. Reclaim all wasteland and give special attention to dry\nfarming;\n\n12. Speedily complete the on-going big irrigation projects,\ntake up thousands of small and minor irrigation projects,\norganise efficient flood management and relief;\n\n13. Encourage the cultivation of pulses, oil-seeds, fruits, nuts,\nand other cash crops;\n\n14. Protect the traditional rights on village forests and Nistar\nLand;\n\n15. Speedily provide the minimum civic facilities like drinking\nwater, roads and other means of communication, public\nhealth and hygiene;\n\n16. Organise the purchase operations through a wide and\nefficient network so as to ensure that all farmers and\nparticularly the small farmers realise the guaranteed price\nand are not forced to make a distress sale; and\n\n17. Restructuring the Agriculture Cost and Price Commission\nso that two-thirds of its members are drawn from those\nengaged in farming.\n\nCow Protection and Animal Standard\n\nThe BJP notes with concern that in spite of the clear\nprovision of the Constitution in Article 48 and the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s emphasis that cow protection is a constitutional mandate\nand slaughter of cows is not enjoined in any religion including\nMuslim religion, complete prohibition of cow slaughter has yet\nnot been introduced in various States of India, specially in West\nBengal and Kerala.\n\nThe BJP recognises the fact that from times immemorial Cow\nprotection has remained one of the basic tenets of Indian culture\nand it is on the patient back of the cow and its progeny that the\nentire structure of the Indian agriculture rests. Over seventy\nmillion animals are employed in the farming operations in Indian\nvillages, more than eighty percent rural transport requirements\nare met by the bullocks. Cow and its progeny continue to be the\nmajor source of power, manure and fuel including bio-gas. Cow is\nalso an effective protection against environmental degradations.\n\nUntitled-10 369 11/7/2016 11:19:53 PM\n\f\n370 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nThe BJP regretfully observes that about three million cows\nare slaughtered every year and most of them for export. The party\nwould put a total ban on the slaughter of the cows. It will\n\n1. Amend the Article 48 of the Constitution to include bulls,\n\nand bullocks, and to prohibit State-trading in slaughter\nof cows; to ensure that no-one has a fundamental right of\ntrade or business to slaughter cows; and to incorporate\nthe subject of Cow-protection in the concurrent list;\n\n2. Implement a policy of Go-Samvardhan or development\nof cow and cattle breeding including the improvement of\nSheep and Goat breeds to bring about a white revolution\nin the country; and\n\n3. Provide tax exemption to the income of Goshalas and\nPinjarapoles.\n\nIndustry\n\nThe BJP\u2019s industrial policy flows from the following\n\nprinciples \u2014\n\n1. Self-reliance: The Party\u2019s industrial policy would be\n\nstrongly nationalistic in approach and content.\nThe party, would like to keep multinationals out of the\nfield of consumer industries. The party regards self-\nreliance as an overriding component in our external\neconomic relations, including the import of technology\nand capital.\n\n2. Decentralisation: The party stands for political as well\nas economic democracy, so that the benefits of economic\ndevelopment go to the smallest man. The party believes\nthat for this decentralisation of economic power, presently\nconcentrated in the hands of the state or of big business,\nis necessary. Primacy for agriculture and Agro-based\nindustries, Swadeshi and importance to the small and\nmedium scale sector in industry are commitments that\nflow from this.\n\n3. Modernisation: BJP will harness new technologies to the\nchanging requirements of the country, and build India\nas a modern and progressive nation. But it will not allow\ntechnology to degrade man as just another input in Gross\n\nUntitled-10 370 11/7/2016 11:19:54 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 371\n\nNational Product. Man will be the main focus of our\ndevelopmental policies.\n\n4. Daridra Narayan Sewa: Consistent with the above three\nelements, the party will aim at securing to every Indian\ncitizen minimum conditions of material welfare in terms\nof food, raiment, shelter, health and education.\n\nThe party will leave no stone unturned in carrying jobs\nto the people. Generation of employment will be a major\ncomponent of BJP\u2019s industrial policy.\n\nBJP will encourage and improve industry all-round. We will\u2014\n\n1. Make the public sector productive and profitable; its\nmanagement will be professionalised and a Central service\ncalled the \u2018Indian Management Service\u2019 will be formed\nto select, train and allocate the professional managers to\nthese units;\n\n2. Demarcate the spheres of multi-national corporations, big-\nscale industry, small-scale industry and cottage industry;\n\n3. Ensure that the existing patent laws safeguarding Indian\nnational interests remain intact under external pressure;\n\n4. Cut down the plethora of controls which presently exist,\nand which breed corruption and dampen enterprises, and\nmaintain only such of these restrictions as are necessary\nfor social justice;\n\n5. Foster the spirit of Swadeshi;\n\n6. Reserve more and more consumer items to small-scale\nand cottage sectors;\n\n7. Make credit more cheaply available to small-scale industry;\n\n8. Modernise industrial plants; and ensure fuller utilization\nof capacity;\n\n9. Promote agro-based industries;\n\n10. Encourage Research and Development to play a live role\nin industrial growth;\n\n11. Require businessmen to consider themselves as trustees\nof the public good;\n\n12. Publicly honour excellence in industry and commerce;\nand\n\n13. Provide tax and non-tax incentives to companies for\nmaking permanent workers share-holders out of a part\n\nUntitled-10 371 11/7/2016 11:19:54 PM\n\f\n372 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nof their gross profit.\n\nNational Textile Policy\n\nThe BJP recognises the need to have an integrated textile policy\nand would ensure protection to handloom and cottage sectors\nof textile industry. To this end the party will demarcate the role\nof each of the Sectors viz. organised sector or mills, powerloom\nand handloom sectors, and Khadi and cottage industries. The\nParty would ensure cheap clothing to the poor and national and\ninternational market to various sectors. The handloom sector would\nreceive adequate protection. The interests of cotton growers would\nalso be duly safeguarded.\n\nTaxation\n\nBJP would adopt firm and bold measures to prevent generation\n\nof black-money.\n\n1. Rationalise and simplify the entire tax structure. The\nhighest rate of income tax shall be 40 per cent;\n\n2. Raise the present exemption limit of income tax to\nRs. 30,000; and introduce differential slab system and\nlower rates for fixed income groups;\n\n3. Abolish octroi duty and require the State Governments to\nmake good the loss of Municipalities;\n\n4. Abolish Sales Tax and require the Centre to make good\nthe loss of State Governments;\n\n5. Exempt all savings and investments in approved\norganisations (including non-government institutions)\nfrom Wealth tax and Estate duty;\n\n6. Share Corporation tax revenues with the States;\n\n7. Take stringent measures against the smugglers and other\neconomic offenders; and\n\n8. Keep a strict watch on the operations of foreign banks.\n\nForeign Assets\n\nThe BJP will enact and strictly enforce a suitable legislation\nso as to require all Indian citizens to disclose their foreign assets\nincluding secret and undeclared bank accounts. The Party will\ntake all measures including signing treaties for unearthing Indian\nunaccounted money in foreign countries.\n\n1. Encourage the growth of small local banks, duly supervised\n\nUntitled-10 372 11/7/2016 11:19:54 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 373\n\nand guaranteed by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\n2. Take drastic action against tax-evasion. Motivate people for\nsavings and protect the honest tax-payer from harassment.\n\n3. Pursue a policy of balanced-budget for the country and\nwill discontinue the present practice of huge deficits in\nthe national budget.\n\n4. Impose statutory ceilings on deficits in budget and debts\nof the government.\n\n5. Convert RBI into an autonomous institution, responsible\nto the Parliament for regulating the monetary policies of\nthe government.\n\nPrices\nBJP will maintain price stability by efficient management of\nproduction and supplies, and by rooting out corruption - which is\na major contributory factor for price rise. With this view the party\nwill evolve a well coordinated wages, prices and profits policy.\nThe BJP will\n1. Appoint a Price Commission to regulate the prices of\nmanufactured goods both in private and public sector;\n2. Fully and promptly neutralise any rise in prices by increased\nDA in both private and public sectors and in private and\nGovernment service, including Central, State and local\ngovernment;\n3. Open more fair price shops in towns and villages, existing\narrangements will be streamlined; and\n4, Make not only grains, sugar and kerosene, but also pulses,\ncooking oil and soap and such sundry articles of every\nday use available at these shops.\n\nConsumer Protection\nThe BJP is of the opinion that there must be a co-relation\nbetween cost of production, price and profit. Nobody should be\npermitted to pocket super-profits. The party also recognises the need\nto enforce strict measures of quality control and price regulation.\nWith this view the BJP will\n1. Build a powerful consumer movement and formulate\na price and profit policy for industrially manufactured\n\nUntitled-10 373 11/7/2016 11:19:55 PM\n\f\n374 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\noods;\n\n2.

All our economic policies\nwhether it is small dams or cottage industry, house construction\nor road building - will boost employment. In addition we will\n\n1. Introduce Employment Guarantee Scheme throughout\nthe country;\n\n2. Provide Pensions for the aged poor;\n\n3. Establish techno-economic project formulation bureaus\nin all districts and blocks for speedy launching of various\nfull employment schemes with a special emphasis to cover\nthe poor under-employed; and\n\n4.

Reservation should also be made for other backward classes\nbroadly on the basis of the Mandal Commission Report,\nwith preference to be given to the poor among these very\nclasses; and\n\n3.

Include Nepali in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nHealth and Nutrition\n\nHealth care to all citizens is the primary duty of the State.\nA majority of children born in families below poverty line are\nundernourished and show sign of mental retardation chiefly due to\nprotein deficiency. BJP, therefore, considers hygiene, sanitation and\nnutrition as more important than medicines and hospitals. We will\n\n1. Along with Allopathy, recognise and promote Ayurveda\n\nand Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy, Chromopathy and\nNature Cure and in general encourage holistic healing;\n\n2.

The party would unhesitatingly\n\nol\n\nUntitled-10 384 11/7/2016 11:19:57 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 385\n\napply appropriate scientific and technological methods for increasing\nproductivity, eradicating poverty, hunger and disease and to provide\nmeaningful employment along with \u2018the basic amenities of life to\nthe vast percentage of population living below the poverty line.\nThe party holds that science is not merely harnessing nature for\nmaterial wealth but is as well liberating and enriching mind and\nenlarging the human spirit.

Ensure job security for sportsmen and admission to the\ncolleges and technical courses; and\n\n5. Respect the Olympic charter and autonomy of the sports\nbodies and will prohibit governmentalisation of sports.\n\nFamily Welfare and Population Policy\n\nThe BJP recognises the growing concern of the people about\nthe dangers of a demographic explosion and distortions created\nby the mishandling of the population control programmes by\nthe Congress(I) government. The BJP is committed to the policy\nof responsible parenthood and believes that population control\nprogramme should be given top priority while formulating national\nplans. It expects all sections of Indian community to fully participate\nin these programmes. The BJP will\n\n1. Strive for creating a national consensus for adopting a\nNational Population Policy and if necessary to take suitable\nlegislative measures for it;\n\n2.

In the opinion of the BJP, the rapid depletion of\nnatural resources, risks of green house effect, the destruction of\ntropical rain-forests, and the hazards of dumping of industrial\nwaste and discharge of highly toxic materials in air and water\nare matters of global concern and world opinion has to be alerted\nagainst them. International efforts are needed to save the planet.\nPreservation of environment has been an integral part of Indian\nway of life. We look upon India as Bharat Mata and a holy land.\nOur land, air, waters, our hills, forests, flora and fauna are all\nsacred to us. We will keep them neat, clean and intact. We will\n\n1. Formulate a National Resources Management Policy and\nadopt a holistic approach in planning;\n\n2.

Make environmental concerns an integral part of education;\nand\n\n9. Take special care in import of technology and promote\nresearch for developing indigenous pollution free\ntechnology.\n\nNS os\n\nCulture\nThe BJP believes in preserving and propagating the cultural\nvalues which have kept India united through the ages. It will\n1. Conserve the ancient heritage of India and make people\nfeel proud of it;\n2. Promote Indian values of life through cultural centres;\n3. Acquaint people with the glorious traditions and\n\nUntitled-10 387 11/7/2016 11:19:58 PM\n\f\n388 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nachievements of ancient Indian genius in the fields of\nscience, technology, medicine, agriculture, etc;\n\n4. Wage a relentless war against superstitions and outmoded\ncustoms; and\n\n5. Emphasise on culture as a dynamic and synthetic process.\n\nArts\n\nArt is the essence of life. BJP will encourage all art forms. It\nwill make the various arts, part of Education, Production and Life.\n\nTo promote theatre, BJP will, as a rule, exempt all theatrical\nperformances from entertainment tax.\n\nThe BJP will encourage folk art in various fields.\n\nFilms\nBJP recognises the great role of cinema in entertainment,\neducation and national integration. BJP will\n1. Have, in addition to \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018U\u2019 Films, \u2018Q\u2019 that is Quality\nfilms, which will be exempt from entertainment taxes;\n2. Have special theatres in metropolitan centres to screen art\nfilms and other Quality films; and\n3. Implement the recommendations of the Karanth Committee\non National Film Policy.\n\nTourism\nThe BJP recognises the importance of tourism as an instrument\nof national integration, international understanding and employment\ngeneration. India abounds in natural beauty and charming tourist\ncentres, which have fascinated people from far distant quarters.\nIt will\n1. Promote tourism both national and international as an\nindustry and give incentives to those who take it as a\nprofession;\n2. Will evolve a policy of integrating tourism and marketing\nof handicrafts and other art works;\n3.

We will\n\n1. Make freedom of the Press an explicit Fundamental Right,\nand not just an implied one derived from the citizen\u2019s right\nto Freedom of Expression;\n\n2. Encourage the growth of the Press by abolishing the duty\non newsprint and the tax on newspaper advertising;\n\n3. Revive the \u2018Prasar Bharati Bill\u2019 of 1979, which sought\nto convert AIR and Doordarshan into an autonomous\ncorporation.

Review the Official Secrets Act in so far as it obstructs the\nRight to Know and enact a Freedom of Information Law;\nand\n\n5. Implement the P.C. Joshi Report on TV software to improve\nthe quality of TV programmes.\n\nOo\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 389 11/7/2016 11:19:58 PM\n\f\nNational Security\n\nThe BJP holds that National security is a primary responsibility of\nState. Security of the nation is an integrated whole: an amalgam\nof the internal, the economic, the social, the political, the military\nand the diplomatic. The BJP will, therefore, resolve the social and\npolitical turmoil in strategically sensitive border states like Jammu\n& Kashmir, Punjab, North East and Assam. Indian diplomacy can\nassist in the protection of our national interests only if it is guided\nby a purposeful foreign policy.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nThe conduct of diplomacy by the Rajiv Government has left\nIndia\u2019s foreign policy in tatters. Never has the country faced so\nmuch animosity from so many of our neighbours, as today. It\nis BJP\u2019s view that the challenges we face in the field of external\nrelations, arise from a re-assertion of the altered importance of\nnon-alignment, as a concept, in a rapidly transforming world. It\nis our view that increasingly, we should give emphasis to foreign\neconomic policy under the time-proved concept of non-alignment.\nIt is vital to move the world towards a greater and more effective\nNorth-South and South-South Co-operation.\n\nThe BJP has stood for, and is committed to mutually beneficial\naim of good bilaterial relations with all our neighbours and a\nstrengthening of SAARC. We stand for a normalisation of relations\nwith China, with due safeguards for Tibet, proper recognition of\nIndia\u2019s national interests and honourable solution of the border\ndispute. We would work for a comprehensive package of settlement\nof all outstanding matters with Pakistan and a widening of the\npeople-to-people relations between our two countries. We would\n\nUntitled-10 390 11/7/2016 11:19:58 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 391\n\nwork for an early withdrawal of the IPKF from Sri Lanka. With\nNepal BJP would seek the re-establishment of harmonious relations\nbased on the concept of interdependent growth.\n\nThe BJP stands for a foreign policy committed to world peace,\ndisarmament and a non-exploitative new international economic\norder. The Party will\n\n1. Work towards re-imparting dynamism to the non-aligned\n\nmovement;\n\n2. Pursue a policy of peace, friendship and co-operation with\n\nneighbouring countries;\n\n3. Reject the domination of super-power interest in South\n\nAsia and the Indian Ocean;\n\n4. Work towards the establishment of a regional common\n\nmarket by strengthening South Asian Regional Conference;\n\n5. Work for the establishment of a new international economic\n\norder, take initiative for trade and monetary reform, North-\nSouth dialogue with emphasis on enhanced South-South\nCo-operation;\n\n6. Continued efforts for the world-wide rejection of apartheid;\n\nand\n\n7. Continuously work towards the solution of problems of\n\npeople of Indian origin living abroad.\n\nDefence\n\nDefence preparedness has suffered grievously in the hands of\nRajiv Government gripped as it is, by ad-hocism and by corruption\nsurrounding defence procurements. This has brought to a standstill\nall policy-making and implementation within the Defence Ministry.\nThe other great harm that Rajiv Government has caused to the\ncountry is excessive misemployment in an adventurous manner,\nof the Indian Armed Forces on Political roles or on militarily\nunattainable tasks. This has caused a very serious lowering of\nthe morale of our Armed Forces, and hence of its total combat\neffectiveness. BJP wishes to caution the nation against the extremely\nharmful consequences if such a situation is permitted to continue.\n\nThe BJP would work actively towards reviving the morale\nof the Armed Forces, giving a solemn assurance that the Indian\nArmed Forces, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, would not\n\nUntitled-10 391 11/7/2016 11:19:58 PM\n\f\n392 \u00a2 Party Document Vol-1\n\nlack either in equipment or in the necessary wherewithals to execute\ntheir responsibilities.\n\nThe BJP will exert for \u2014\n\n1. Optimum defence preparedness including production of\n\nnuclear bombs and delivery systems;\n\n2. Diversification of sources of supply of defence hardware,\ncontinued emphasis on maximising indigenous production,\nself-reliance and Defence Research and Development;\nGreater public accountability of defence expenditure;\nEnhancement of Indian Navy\u2019s capability;\n\n5. Identification, and elimination of, foreign lobbies associated\n\nwith defence weapons procurement and contracts; and\n\n6. Improve service conditions in the Armed Forces so as\n\nto make careers in the Army, Navy and Air Force more\nattractive to the best talent in the country.\n\nThis then is the programme which the BJP pledges to implement\nunder the inspiring leadership of Shri A.B. Vajpayee and Shri L.K.\nAdvani. The dedicated cadres of the party, headed by these brilliant\nleaders of impeccable record of clean public life and selfless service\nto the nation, are committed to usher in a new political culture. In\nthe opinion of the BJP a critical moment of history has arrived for\nIndia. The country can not afford to miss this moment of history,\nthis opportunity to throw out the last vestige of the dynastic rule\nmainly responsible for this country\u2019s ruination.\n\nThe BJP on its part has left no stone unturned in its efforts\nto put up a determined and united electoral battle and has\nunhesitatingly sacrificed its party interests whenever national\ninterests so demanded. The Bharatiya Janata Party calls upon the\npeople to join in its struggle for a value based polity and throw\nout this corrupt and incompetent government.\n\neo\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 392 11/7/2016 11:19:59 PM\n\f\nTowards a New Polity\n\nElection Manifesto\n\n1984\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 393\n\f\nUntitled-10 394 11/7/2016 11:19:59 PM\n\f\nIndian polity today stands at a critical crossroad of history. The state\nof the nation is examplified by the breakdown of law and order,\nan absence of purpose and direction in governance, deep divisions\nwithin society marked by deliberately engineered communal and\ncastesist passions, and a serious erosion of institutions. Near about\nhalf our citizens continue to groan under the dehumanising yoke\nof abject poverty aggravated by spiraling prices. Urban chaos and\nrural neglect have degraded the quality of our citizens\u2019 life.\n\nThe shocking assassination of the late Prime Minister\nand subsequent occurrences are the most horrifying and telling\nsymptoms of erosion of moral authority and a total decay of the\nruling party.\n\nAt such a critical juncture a new direction and a fresh political\ninitiative was expected from the successor government. Betraying\nall hopes, the government of the day, mired in immobility, a\nprisoner of the old caucus, continues cynically to repeat yesterday\u2019s\nirrelevancies. When decisive action is called for, it merely mouths\nplatitudes and attempts to transfer responsibility by accusing others.\n\nNational integrity, unity, and cohesion are the paramount need\nof the hour; the reestablishment of national consensus a primary\ntask. Today\u2019s challenge cannot be met by yesterday\u2019s government.\n\nThe need of the hour is a new polity, anew government, a new\nleadership. In the new polity we stand committed to value-based\npolitics, to democracy, to positive secularism, and to Gandhian\neconomics.\n\nIndia needs a new government which is clean, effective\npurposeful and representative of the rich diversity of our land.\nSuch a government must restore the moral authority of the State,\ncommit itself afresh to the integrity of the nation and guarantee\nthe security of every single citizen of the country. This Republic of\n\nUntitled-10 395 11/7/2016 11:19:59 PM\n\f\n396 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nours can no longer be left a Prisoner of the corrupt and criminal.\nTo fulfill this task the Bharatiya Janata Party offers to the\nnation the following programme.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 396 11/7/2016 11:19:59 PM\n\f\nNational Politics\nNational Unity and Positive Secularism\n\nBJP is pledged to defend the unity and integrity of India. It believes\nthat India, from Kashmir to Kanya Kumari, is one country, and all\nIndians, irrespective of language, caste or creed, are one people.\n\nUnity in diversity has been the hallmark of Indian culture,\nwhich is a unique multi-heud synthesis of the cultural contributions\nmade over the centuries by different peoples and religions. In\nIndian tradition, since times immemorial, the State has always\nbeen a civil institution, which makes no distinction between one\ncitizen and another on grounds of his religion. The very idea of a\ntheocratic state is alien to Indian political history. So, when India\nbecame independent in 1947, we very naturally declared ourselves\na secular state, unconcerned that Pakistan had opted for theocracy.\n\nIt is this positive concept of secularism to which BJP is\ncommitted. Secularism should not be allowed to become a\neuphemism for appeasement, alternately of this community, or\nthat, or a sordid political device to garner bloc-votes.\n\nOurs is a democratic federal Constitution. It envisages strong\nStates, with a strong Centre. Indeed the whole cannot be strong\nunless the constituent parts are strong too. But over the years the\nStates have been increasingly reduced to glorified municipalities.\nThe BJP will restore the balance between the Centre and the States\nas visualised by our constitution makers. And to that end, it will:\n\n1. Support and strengthen state Governments and not\n\ndestabilize and topple them;\n\n2. Appoint State Governors in consultation with State\n\nGovernments;\n\nUntitled-10 397 11/7/2016 11:19:59 PM\n\f\n398 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n3. Enact an anti-Defection Law;\n\n4. Limit the number of ministers to 10 per cent of legislators;\nas per the Report of the Committee on Defections;\n\n5. Give the states a fairer share of Central revenues and\nincrease the financial powers of the States;\n\n6. Delete the temporary Article 370 of the Constitution;\n\n7. Constitute an Inter-State Council under Article 263 to settle\nall Inter-State and State-Centre disputes; and\n\n8. Guarantee to all minorities, linguistic and religious, peace\nand security, and full opportunities for progress and\ndevelopment.\n\nFair Elections\n\nThe BJP believes in the primacy of elections. It is convinced\nthat elections must be held regularly and very fairly. They must\nhonestly reflect the public mind. And the parties fighting these\nelections must also function democratically \u2014and cleanly.\n\nFour evils threaten to subvert the freedom and fairness of\nelections \u2014 money-power, ministerial-power, media-power and\nmuscle-power. The BJP is resolved to contain and curb all these evils.\n\nThe party will give high priority to electoral reform. More\nspecifically, BJP will\n\n1. Give the right of vote to all those above eighteen;\n\n2. Introduce Identity Cards for voters;\n\n3. Use electronic voting machines, and to this end, make\nnecessary changes in the election law;\n\n4. As recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee\non Amendments to Election Law, examine the feasibility\nof introducing the List system of elections;\n\n5. Give the right of Postal Ballot to Indian citizens living\nabroad;\n\n6. Hold State and Central elections simultaneously every\nfive years;\n\n7. Make the Election Commission a multi-member body;\nstrengthen its independence by making expenditure\nincurred on the Commission expenditure charged on the\nConsolidated Fund of India, as is provided in the case of\nComptroller and Auditor General and Supreme Court and\n\nUntitled-10 398 11/7/2016 11:19:59 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 399\n\nHigh Court judges, and by providing the Commission\nwith an independent, minimal infrastructure;\n\n8. Extend the jurisdiction of the Election Commission to local\nbody elections, and to ensure that elections to local bodies\nare held regularly;\n\n9. Arrange for public funding of elections, as is the case in\nGermany, Japan and most other democratic countries;\n\n10. Have party accounts publicly audited;\n\n11. To prevent abuse of governmental power by the ruling party,\ngive legal teeth to the Code of Conduct framed by Election\nCommission; violation of the code shall be made a corrupt\npractice under the law.\n\nCorruption\n\nIn the last 4 years or so corruption has not only become way\nof life but has in fact been institutionalized and legitimized. An\nunholy nexus has developed between the corrupt politician, the\ncorrupt bureaucrat and the corrupt businessman. The volume of\nblack-money has grown phenomenally and is now estimated at\naround 50 per cent of the total money in circulation.\n\nThe BJP holds that the roots of all corruption lie in political and\nelectoral corruption. While measures to cleanse elections have been\ndealt with earlier, with regard to political corruption in general,\nthe BJP will, inter alia, take the following steps:\n\n1. It will enact a law, and create an Ombudsman-Lokpal and\nLokayaukta \u2014 as recommended by the Administrative\nReform\u2019s Commission; and\n\n2. Streamline procedures and rules relating to purchases\nawarding of contracts etc. in Government and public\nsector undertakings and regulate discretionary powers of\npolitical authorities; political interference and intervention\nin day-to-day End Government departments and public\nsector functioning of actions, dealing with purchases and\naward of contracts etc.; Rationalise and streamline the tax\nstructure, providing sufficient incentives to savings and\navoiding harassment to honest tax-payers and to avoid\ngeneration of black money; Require all Ministers to make\nan annual declaration of assets.\n\nUntitled-10 399 11/7/2016 11:20:00 PM\n\f\n400 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nOur North East\n\nAll our North Eastern States suffer from unsatisfactory,\neconomic development, insufficient recognition of local diversity,\ninadequate participation in National tasks, unchecked illegal\nimmigration resulting in demographic imbalances and serious\nsocial destabilisation. The BJP believes that a resolution of all\nthese problems has to be undertaken jointly and keeping in mind\nthe peculiarities of the region. In this endeavor the Brahmaputra\nValley and the State of Assam play a crucial role. No integrated\ndevelopment of the region is possible if Assam continues to remain\nunstable.\n\nThe BJP will, therefore, give high priority to the solution of\nthe many problems afflicting Assam. It will work purposefully and\nexpeditiously for their early resolution.\n\nWhilst cooperating with the efforts of the Chief Election\nCommissioner, to carry out a detailed enumeration, leading to a\nproper revision and publication of electoral rolls, the party will\nsimultaneously continue to emphasise the need for adequate\nsafeguards so that the scrutiny of enumeration lists becomes\nmeaningful.\n\nMindful of the national commitment of bonafide refugees in\nthe region, the BJP will work continuously to protect their interests.\n\nIn addition, the BJP will take all effective steps to prevent\nfurther illegal immigration. For this purpose it will work towards\njoint, cooperative effort by all the concerned adjoining states like\nTripura, West Bengal and Bihar.\n\nAt the heart of the continued impasse in Assam is the alienation\nof a whole section of our countrymen, resulting in the citizens of\nthat state being deprived of their right to participate in current\nelections. The BJP will immediately resume the process of negotiation\nand reconciliation so that the many problems of the region can be\ntackled with the wholehearted participation of the citizens.\n\nPunjab\n\n\u2018The BJP shares the agony of Punjab with the Punjabis. It\ncongratulates the people of Punjab on maintaining the peace in\nthe Punjab in the face of grave provocation.\n\nThe BJP holds the Congress (I) squarely responsible for\n\nUntitled-10 400 11/7/2016 11:20:00 PM\n\f\nElection Manifestoes * 401\n\nencouraging separatist and terrorist elements in the Punjab. As\na result, for four long agonising years, the State has been subject\nto an orgy of murder and mayhem. The tragic murder of Prime\nMinister Mrs Gandhi, and the bestial carnage which followed in\nits wake, also, are poison-fruits of Government's Punjab policy.\nThe BJP wishes to declare unequivocally that the nation shall\nnot allow another assault on the country\u2019s integrity, and that there\ncan be no compromise with those who talk of Khalistan. At the\nsame time, the BJP will not suffer any harm being done to innocent\npeople, Hindu or Sikh.\n1. The Punjab problem is basically political and we will solve\nit politically;\n2. Separatism and terrorism will be sternly dealt with;\n3. We will adequately compensate the sufferers of violence\nduring the last three years;\n4. The BJP will refer territorial claims and counterclaims river\nwaters and other outstanding issues, to the Chief Justice\nof India, for arbitration within one year.\n\nLaw & Order\nThe BJP views with alarm the rise of social violence in the\ncountry. This includes communal violence, atrocities on Harijans\nand tribals, and criminal assaults on women. It is committed to the\nsecurity of life, limb, property and honour of all citizens. Whenever\nthere is a serious eruption of violence\n1. There must be a judicial inquiry;\n2. The inquiry report must be published;\n3. The Report recommendations must be implemented;\n4. Men guilty of incitement to violence or dereliction of duty\nwill be punished;\n5. All riot sufferers must be suitably and adequately\ncompensated and rehabilitated;\n6. We will conduct in-depth socio-economic studies of riot\nprone areas to take effective steps for riot-prevention.\n\nThe Police & The People\n\nThe Police is a vital organ of the State. Over the years, the gulf\nbetween the people and the Police has grown very wide. The people\ncomplain of Police Zulum; and the Police complains of political\ninterference and of bad living and working conditions. The BJP will\n\nUntitled-10 401 11/7/2016 11:20:00 PM\n\f\n402 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n1. Implement the Police Commission\u2019s recommendations\nparticularly with regard to the emoluments and service\nconditions of police personnel;\n\n2. Modernise the Police Force and convert it into an efficient\nand impartial instrument of law and order:\n\n3. Set up a machinery for redressal of Police People\u2019s\ngrievances;\n\n4. Stop political meddling in police work;\n\n5. Set up local committees of respected citizens to bridge the\ngap between the People and the Police.\n\nJustice\nThe BJP attaches the greatest importance to Justice \u2014Justice\nthat will be quick, inexpensive and just. It notes with regret that\nover the years there has been an all all-round deterioration in this\nrespect. The Independence of the Judiciary has been seriously\neroded. BJP will take corrective steps to restore the independence,\nintegrity and efficiency of the judicial system. We will\n1. Simplify the legal procedures and increase the number of\njudges, so that no case lingers on beyond one year;\n2. Appoint Chief Justices strictly in order of seniority;\n3. Not harass judges with politically inspired transfers;\n4. Offer better emoluments to judges to attract more talent\nto the Bench;\n5. Raise the retirement age of judges to 65, give them full\npensions equal to their salary, and give them quasi-judicial\nwork after retirement without extra cash payment.\n\nHuman Rights Commission\n\nBJP will widen the scope of the present ineffective Minorities\nCommission and convert it into a Human Rights Commission to take\ncare of the just rights of all individuals, groups and communities.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-10 402 11/7/2016 11:20:00 PM\n\f\nNational Economy\n\nThe National Economy is in bad shape. While production is moving\nup at snail\u2019s pace, prices are galloping away. More people are\nunemployed today than at the time of Independence. The rich\nare getting richer while the poor stay poor. Village industries are\ndying. Many of our industries are working at only 40 per cent of\ncapacity. More and more millions are falling below the Poverty\nLine everywhere. Last year alone the Public Sector lost Rs. 6,000\ncrores (Rupees Six thousand crores) only.\n\nThe BJP will reverse all these ugly trends and give the country\na humane economy. It will take all steps necessary to achieve full\nemployment, maximise production, stabilise prices and pull more\nand more millions above the Poverty Line, until nobody is left\npoor in the country.\n\nAgriculture\nAgriculture is our biggest industry. It is the backbone of the\neconomy. BJP will encourage it in every way. In particular, we will\n1. Implement the land laws; quickly complete on-going big\nirrigation projects; start thousands of small irrigation\nworks; subsidies inputs; give remunerative prices; establish\na parity of agricultural and industrial prices;\n2. Specially encourage pulses, oil seeds, fruits, nuts and,\nvegetables cultivation, and also production of cash crops;\n3. Increase milk supply and effect a White Revolution;\n4. Attain food self-sufficiency and never again need to import\nfood-grains.\nBJP will encourage and improve industry all-round. We will\n1. Make the public sector productive and profitable;\n\nUntitled-10 403 11/7/2016 11:20:01 PM\n\f\n404 * Party Document Vol-1\n\n2. Demarcate the spheres of multinational corporations, other\nforeign companies, big industry, small-scale industry and\ncottage industry;\n\n3. Cut down on the plethora of controls which presently exist,\n\nand which breed corruption and dampen enterprise; and\n\nmaintain only such of these restrictions as are necessary\nfor social justice.\n\nFoster the Swadeshi spirit;\n\nReserve more and more consumer items to small-scale\n\nand cottage sectors;\n\nMake credit more cheaply available to small-scale industry;\n\nModernise industrial plants;\n\nae\n\nPromote agro-based industries;\n\nEncourage Research and Development;\n\n10. Require businessmen to act as trustees of the public good;\nand\n\n11. Publicly honour excellence in industry and commerce.\n\nSe MOND\n\nFinance\n\nThe BJP will handle public funds with the same care and\n\ncaution as one would handle one\u2019s own funds.\n\n1. We will not impose any new taxes;\n\n2. We will reduce some taxes. To begin with, the income tax\nexemption will be raised to Rs. 30,000;\n\n3. We will abolish octroi duty-and require the State\nGovernment to make good the loss of municipalities;\n\n4. We will abolish Sales Tax and require the Centre to make\ngood the loss of State Governments, by matching increases\nin excise duties;\n\n5. We will rationalise and simplify the entire tax structure.\nThe highest rate of income tax shall be 49 per cent;\n\n6. All savings and investments in approved organisations\n(including non-government institutions.) will be exempted\nfrom wealth tax and Estate duty;\n\n7. Corporation tax revenues will be shared with the States;\n\n8.

A strict watch will be kept on the operations of foreign\nbanks,\n\n10. We will encourage the growth of small local banks, duty\n\nsupervised and guaranteed by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nPrices\n\nBJP will maintain price stability by efficient management of\n\nproduction and supplies, and by rooting out corruption.\n\n1. Any rise in prices will be fully and promptly neutralised\nby increased DA in both private and public sectors and in\nprivate and Government service, including central, State\nand local government.\n\n2. We will open more Fair Price Shops in towns and villages;\nexisting arrangements will be streamlined.\n\n3. Make not only grains, sugar and kerosene, but also pulses,\ncooking oil and soap and such sundry articles of every\nday use available at these shops.\n\nLabour\n\nBJP believes in healthy trade unionism.

All\nour economic policies whether it is small dams or cottage industry,\nhouse construction or road building will boost employment. In\naddition we will\n\n1. Introduce Employment Guarantee Scheme on the\n\nMaharashtra pattern, throughout the country;\n2. There will be pensions for the aged poor; and\n3. There will be \u2018Antyodaya\u2019 for the poorest of the poor.\n\nUntitled-10 405 11/7/2016 11:20:01 PM\n\f\n406 * Party Document Vol-1\n\nEnergy\nThere is a serious energy crisis throughout the world. The\ncrisis is particularly acute in India with heavy oil imports, serious\npower-shortages and high power prices. This Situation will have\nto be tackled on a war-footing. BJP will\n1. Intensify efforts to find more oil, coal and natural gas\nreserves;\n2. Improve the working of power plants which are now\nfunctioning at less than 50 per cent of capacity;\nStop the massive theft of electric power;\n4. Introduce power-efficient energy-saving devices in homes\nand factories;\n5. Increase forest cover from the present 19 per cent of land\nto the desired 33 per cent;\n6.

BJP will make life more bearable for them.\n\nVillagers\n1. Since a majority of the people live in villages, a major\nportion of development funds will be invested in the\nvillages;\n2. Drinking water will be made available to all the remaining\nabout 1.5 lakh waterless villages during the next five years;\n\n. Cow slaughter will be banned;\n\n4.

Ask all establishments to build Holiday Homes and organize\ncooperative stores, for their staff.\n\nGovernment Employees\nCentral Government employees suffer from all the problems\nof the salariat; additionally, their salaries are lower than those in\nprivate service. Indeed, fourteen State Governments are paying\nhigher salaries than the Central Government. BJP will move fast\nin the matter. It will\n1. Ask the Fourth Pay Commission to submit a quick interim\nreport, doing urgent justice to the employees;\n2. Order full and prompt neutralisation of all increases in\nthe cost of living index;\n3. Immediately pay all arrears of DA instalments that have\nbecome due;\n4.

Grant travel concessions to pensioners.\n\nEx-servicemen\n\nThe welfare of ex-servicemen is inextricably linked with the\nmorale of serving personnel because we believe that today\u2019s soldier,\nsail or airman is tomorrow\u2019s ex-serviceman.\n\nThe BJP holds that insufficient attention has been paid to\ntheir welfare, pensions, re-employment and other allied matters,\nThe BJP would work towards a purposeful resolution of all these\nproblems. We believe that the last Supreme Court judgement has\ngiven grounds for a great deal of disaffection. We would, therefore,\ntake steps to ensure that:\n\n1.

This would include\n\nall old pensioners irrespective of their date of retirement;\n\n3.

Take steps towards employing mechanical means of\nhandling refuse, and thus to do away with the degrading\npractice of carrying night soil on the head;\n\n5. Evolve anew forest policy based on a partnership between\nthe forest tribals and the forest authorities;\n\n6. Frame policies which protect tribals from exploitation,\nland-alienation and indebtedness, and enable them to\ngrow in accordance with their own genius.\n\nWomen\nThough women are described as the better half, they continue\nto be treated worse. BJP will redress this Unbalance. We will\n1. Implement the Report of the Committee on the Status of\nWomen (December 1974);\n2. Build hostels for single women working in the cities;\n3.

It\nwill make the various arts, part of Education, Production and Life.\nTo promote theatre, BJP will, as a rule, exempt all theatrical\nperformances from entertainment tax.\n\nSports\nGovernment has set up a Sports Ministry; but it has issued\nPolicy Directive.

The BJP would\nwork towards fulfilling this national duty with a sense of high\npurpose. Security of the nation is an integrated whole: an amalgam\nof the internal, the economic, the social, the political, the military\nand the diplomatic. Internal cohesiveness, and a united and\ndetermined national will is the foundation of a nation\u2019s defence\npreparedness. The BJP will, therefore, resolve the social and\npolitical turmoil in strategically sensitive border states like J &\nK, Punjab, North East and Assam. Indian diplomacy can assist\nin the protection of our national interests only if it is guided by\na purposeful foreign policy.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nThe BJP will continue to follow an independent foreign policy\ncommitted to world peace, disarmament and a new international\neconomic order. We believe that the task of freeing the world\nfrom economic exploitation, external influences, domination,\nand colonialism in all its new forms is yet to be completed.

It\nreaffirms its faith in all Indians being co-sharers in the continuing\ntask of nation-building and invites all to work shoulder to\nshoulder with the rest of their brethren.

It was\nthrust upon the country by a motley combination that put political\nnegativism, narrow personal interests and greed for power far\nabove the national good. The Government led by Shri Atal Bihari\nVajpayee lost the vote in the Lok Sabha on April 17 by just one and\nthat too questionable vote. In spite of promising a new government\n\u2018in five minutes\u2019 and futilely attempting widespread defections,\nthis negative coalition by the Congress failed to come up with\nany alternative arrangement, forcing the dissolution of the Lok\nSabha and fresh elections. A serving, performing Government was\nneedlessly destabilised.\n\nHardly had the country absorbed the shock of this avoidable\nuncertainty, then we were faced by Pakistani armed intrusion Kargil.\n\nThe Government rose to the challenge and acted decisively.\nFaced by this aggression in Kargil, the response of the Government\nwas swift, though measured.\n\nThe last of the Pakistani intruders were cleared from the Kargil\nSector on 27th July.\n\nWe salute the heroism, dedication and selflessness of our armed\nforces. We dedicate ourselves anew to preserving the honour and\nterritorial integrity of our motherland. We reiterate our commitment\nto look after the welfare of the armed forces, and of the dependents\nof all those that laid down their lives in service of our motherland.\n\nThe security of the nation is our paramount duty. In fulfillment\nof this sacred duty we will ensure that the neglect of defence\npreparedness by the previous governments during the last decade\nshall be corrected. The defence of India and the needs of our armed\nforces is our commitment.\n\nUntitled-4 119 11/7/2016 8:34:57 PM\n\f\n120 * 1999 Manifesto: NDA\n\nThis General Election allows the country a great opportunity of\nfinally putting an end to the era of political negativism, uncertainty\nand dynasticism. In this hour of national challenge, when the faith\nof the people in democratic institutions is under test it is vital that\nall nationalist forces join hands. This is the moment to look ahead,\nto a new, resurgent India.\n\nIn Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the country has a leader\nwho blends tradition with modernity, a leader who understands\nIndia and the world and a statesman who is accepted by all sections\nof the country. In just 13 months, the Vajpayee Government\nset new parameters of purposeful governance. In the realms of\nnational security, regional cooperation, economic modernization\nand centre-state relations, the Vajpayee Government has shown\nthe way forward. Under Shri Vajpayee\u2019s leadership the National\nDemocratic Alliance seeks a firm and resounding mandate to\ncomplete the unfinished agenda.\n\nThe National Agenda for Governance of the National\nDemocratic Alliance constitutes the basis of our joint commitment\nfor a stable Government to take India into the new millennium.\nOn this occasion we appeal for a new political age of reconciliation\nand accord based on our principled commitment to:\n\n\u00a2 National Security - ensuring full combat effectiveness of\nour armed forces;\n\n\u00a2 National Reconstruction - an end to divisiveness and a\nmoratorium on contentious issues;\n\n\u00a2 Dynamic diplomacy - In service of motherland to obtain\nfor India it\u2019s rightful place in the comity of nations;\n\n\u00a2 Federal harmony ensuring a partnership of the Centre and\nStates;\n\n\u00a2 Economic Modernization - harnessing technology for\nrapid, equitable growth;\n\n\u00a2 Secularism - the emotional harmony of all Indians and\nfull protection of minorities;\n\n* Social justice - empowerment of all weaker sections and\ngender rights;\n\n\u00a2 Probity - transparency of decision-making and corruption-\nfree governance;\n\nWhen the whole nation was thrown into the vortex of political\n\nUntitled-4 120 11/7/2016 8:34:57 PM\n\f\n1999 Manifesto: NDA \u00a2 121\n\ninstability because of the toppling of the Government headed\nby Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, by the irresponsible combination\nof Congress, the left parties and their old and new found allies;\nwhen the whole nation felt that it was duped and deceived by\ntheir chicanery because they could not fulfill their boast of an\nalternative Government in \u2018five minutes\u2019 - even for several days;\nand when the whole nation was on the verge of loosing faith in\nour democratic system was getting cynical about politics and\npoliticians; the signatory political parties came together as an act\nof national commitment and founded the National Democratic\nAlliance (NDA), under the leadership of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee,\nto set the Indian polity on a new course for the future.\n\nThe reason for creating the NDA is to lift the spirit of the\nnation at large, to draw its people together and, most importantly,\nto rebuild the bonds of common purpose that are the very roots of\nour democratic polity.\n\nThe NDA came into being because of an historic need and\nrealisation amongst us that our young democracy cannot bear\nthe fits and tremors of frequent elections which will undermine\nthe peoples\u2019 faith in the democratic process. Therefore, with a\nconsensus on a common cause and a common set of principles we\nhave sunk our differences to weld ourselves into a solid phalanx\nof a single dominant political formation and thereby we fulfill the\nresolve of the Indian people to give themselves a stable, strong\nand progressive Government.\n\nWeare proud that the NDA is representative of both national\ninterests and regional aspirations - after all the NDA is nothing but\nthe mirror-image of our nation\u2019s unity in multifaceted diversity,\nrich pluralism and federalism.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-4 121 11/7/2016 8:34:58 PM\n\f\nOur Mission\n\nThe NDA\u2019s mission in politics is to build a bond of trust between\nGovernment and people. This is the only way a democracy can\nflourish; but unfortunately has been ignored during the last 50\nyears of one-party rule.\n\nTherefore, the NDA pledges to the people of India a\nGovernment which shares their hopes and anxieties and which\nwill work as partner with all people irrespective of class, caste\nand religion - not just with a privileged few. This is our contract\nwith the people.\n\nThe NDA is new; the NDA is the future and the NDA is a\nbroad- based movement for progress and justice.\n\nOur vision is one of national renewal with modern programmes\nof change for a resurgent India.\n\nWe reach out to the minorities and even at the cost of repetition\nproclaim that we will safeguard the rights as enshrined in our\nConstitution. NDA is the political arm of none other than the Indian\npeople as a whole. No one will be cast aside; fairness and justice\nwill be rendered to one and all and we assure you that there will\nnot be any discrimination.\n\nWe appeal to our brothers and sisters of the minorities that we\nwhole-heartedly extend our hands of friendship, in these fraternal\nwords:\n\nLet us hold hands and walk together to build a resurgent,\nmodern India.\n\nLet us throw away our old prejudices.\n\nLet us put an end to divisiveness.\n\nLet us have a moratorium on contentious issues.\n\nLet us bind ourselves with bonds of trust and friendship.\n\nUntitled-4 122 11/7/2016 8:34:58 PM\n\f\n1999 Manifesto: NDA \u00a2 123\n\nWe want an India which we all feel part of, in whose future\nwe all have a stake. And we want to enter the new millennium\nwith confidence; not with divisive feelings.\n\nThis is our call for reconciliation and it is part of our\ncommitment to the minorities.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-4 123 11/7/2016 8:34:58 PM\n\f\nAgenda For Governance\n\nA Commitment to Good Governance\n1. Our first commitment to the people is to give a stable,\nhonest, transparent, and efficient government capable\nof accomplishing all-round development. For this, the\ngovernment shall introduce time-bound programmes of\nneeded administrative reforms including those for the\nPolice and other Civil Services.\n\nEconomy\n2. We will continue with the reform process, give it a strong\nSwadeshi thrust to ensure that the national economy\ngrows on the principle that \u2018India shall be built by Indians\nreappraise and revitalise reforms through giving primacy\nto removal of unemployment, and to an accelerated\ndevelopment of infrastructure, particularly energy and\npower production. We will bring GDP growth to the\n7-8% bracket, and control deficits - fiscal and revenue.\nWe will examine the possibility of enacting a Fiscal\nResponsibility Act. We will take all such steps as would\nexpedite implementation of policies and programmes in\naccordance with our national interests; and give to the\nentire national development efforts a humane face with\ntotal eradication of poverty as the ultimate goal. For this\n\u2018Berozgari Hatao\u2019 - eradicate unemployment - is our\ncall. Swadeshi is not reinventing the wheel. It means that\nwe will facilitate the domestic industry to gain enough\nmuscles to compete with the multinationals in the local and\nglobal markets. We want domestic companies to flourish\n\nUntitled-4 124 11/7/2016 8:34:58 PM\n\f\n1999 Manifesto: NDA \u00a2 125\n\nand acquire a Trans National status. At the same time the\ncountry cannot do without FDI because besides capital stock\nit brings with it technology, new market practices and most\nimportantly employment. Our target is to achieve at least\n$10 billion per year which will commensurate with our\ngrowth objectives. The old leftist approach sought complete\nstate control of industry while the rightist approach\nwanted to leave everything to the market. We reject both.\nGovernment and industry must work together to achieve\nkey objectives aimed at enhancing the dynamism of the\nmarket with effective and efficient regulatory mechanisms.\nIn fact the issue is not about capitalism or socialism, nor\nis it about market or less state. It is about better society,\nabout improving the way citizens can demand and obtain\nall sorts of public goods. It is about dignity for all. We\nfirmly resolve that poverty should be relegated to history\nlike slavery, colonialism, small pox and cholera and we\nshould meet the challenge of mobilising resources for that\nby undertaking the challenge of restructuring priorities\nand mainstreaming these priorities into new programmes\nof pro-poor growth and redistribution towards poverty\neradication -That is how we plan to eradicate absolute\npoverty within this generation - within the first decades\nof 21st century - and we strongly feel that it is feasible\nand affordable, infact, it is a moral imperative which we\nwill not miss.\n\n3. We will carefully analyse the effects of globalisation,\ncalibrate its process by devising a timetable to suit\nour national conditions and requirements so as not to\nundermine but strengthen the national economy, the\nindigenous industrial base and the financial and services\nsectors.\n\n4. We will earmark 60% of the Plan Funds for and effect public\ninvestment in agriculture, rural development, irrigation\nand by diverse incentives, including tax shelters, achieve a\nquantum leap in agricultural production so that agriculture,\nhorticulture, forestry, food processing, fisheries and so on\nbecome the vehicles for growth resulting in an enhancement\n\nUntitled-4 125 11/7/2016 8:34:59 PM\n\f\n126 * 1999 Manifesto: NDA\n\nof the purchasing power of the people. Effective crop\ninsurance schemes will be introduced. Special efforts will\nbe made in Animal Husbandry, Dairying, particularly in\nrespect of Cow and its progeny. This is one of the routes\nto generating employment, thus eradicating hunger and\npoverty in rural as well as urban areas. Subsidies of all\nkinds will be implemented in such a manner that maximize\nbenefits to all section of the agricultural population.\nDevelopment of medium and small scale irrigation projects\nshall receive priority attention; emphasis for investment\nwill be in accordance with the potential for development.\n\n5.

We will examine and take\ntime-bound steps to link Ganga-Cauvery Rivers. Sethu\nSamudharam Canal Project will also be undertaken.\n\n6. We will increase the national savings to 30% of the GDP in\nthe next five years by appropriate incentives and through\nmotivation; encourage Foreign Direct Investment in core\nareas so that it usefully supplements the national efforts\nand discourage FDI in non-priority areas.\n\n7. We will institute a comprehensive study of the financial,\ntechnological and social security requirements of the\nself-employed and unincorporated sector; also constitute\na Development Bank to promote this largest segment of\nthe national economy which, too, has great employment\nand self-employment potential. Further, in addition to\nfinancial support institutions we will bring into being other\ninstitutional systems for providing services, technology\nand marketing facilities for artisans, the small-scale,\nvillage, khadi, powerloom, handloom, handicrafts and\nsuch other industries. This and the Agriculture sectors are\nan untapped source with unlimited scope for generation\nof employment.\n\n8. We will give a major thrust to infrastructure development,\nparticularly energy and power, by recommending public\nexpenditure in the sector. Towards this we will access\nlong-term funds in the national and international markets,\n\nUntitled-4 126 11/7/2016 8:34:59 PM\n\f\n1999 Manifesto: NDA \u00a2 127\n\nremove administrative bottlenecks, reverse the slowdown\nin this critical area of national economy thus giving a fresh\nimpetus to growth.

The Alliance will embark upon a strategic pro-poor policy\nin terms of which those living below the poverty line are\nnot to be pitied but treated as a net resource replete with\ntheir own ideas and experience well in tune with local\nconditions. Every effort will be made to provide them\nwork locally and ensure that schemes for their welfare are\ncompetently and honestly administered. They themselves\nwill be treated as participants and facilitators in this noble\nventure. The services of NGOs, well versed in this field\nand, preferably originating locally, will also be enlisted\nwherever considered necessary.\n\nFood Security and Price Stability\n14.

We have effectively engaged with the international\ncommunity and obtained a high degree of understanding.\n\nUntitled-4 132 11/7/2016 8:35:00 PM\n\f\n1999 Manifesto: NDA \u00a2 133\n\nThis engagement process shall be developed to improve\nIndia\u2019s standing in the international community.\n\nWe will promote and strengthen regional groupings on the\nlines of SAARC and ASEAN, and reorient our diplomacy\nto pursue economic, commercial goals energy security\ngoals. We will strongly support any attempt to build a\nsystem of trade and economic cooperation through an\nexpanded global system of trade preferences (GSTP) among\ndeveloping countries. We will seek to assert more robustly\nIndia\u2019s national interests, especially at the forthcoming\nreview conference of the WTO, scheduled for December,\n1999. We are committed to making the voice of India as\nthe voice of the developing world.\n\nGenuine Secularism\n\n36. We are committed to establishing a civilised, humane\nand just civil order; that which does not discriminate on\nground \u2014 of caste, religion, class, colour, race or sex. We\nwill truly and genuinely uphold and practise the concept\nof secularism consistent with the Indian tradition of \u2018Sarva\npanth samadara\u2019 (equal respect for all faiths) and on the\nbasis of equality of all. We are committed to the economic,\nsocial and educational development of the minorities and\nwill take effective steps in this regard.\n\nSCs, STs and Backwards Classes\n37. The interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and\nBackward Classes will be adequately safeguarded by\nappropriate legal, executive and societal efforts and by\nlarge scale education and empowerment. We will provide\nlegal protection to existing percentages of reservation in\ngovernment employment and educational institutions at\nthe Centre and State level. If required, the Constitution\nwill be amended to maintain the system of reservation.\nWe will continue to offer all assistance to the SCs, STs\nand Backward Classes to ensure their speedy socio-\neconomic development. We will remove the last vestiges of\nuntouchability from our society. Further, we will present\n\nUntitled-4 133 11/7/2016 8:35:00 PM\n\f\n134 \u00a2 1999 Manifesto: NDA\n\na National Charter for Social Justice (Samajik Nyay) based\non the principle of social harmony (Samajik Samarasata).\nWe are committed to extending the SC/ST reservations\nfor another 10 years. Reservation percentages, above 50%,\nas followed by certain states shall be sanctified through\nnecessary legislative measures.\n\nEnvironment\n\n38. We will establish an appropriate legal framework for\nthe protection of the environment and unveil a National\nEnvironment Policy to balance between development\nand ecology. A Vanvasi Fund for the benefit of Vanvasis\nshall be established. To discourage poaching of Wild Life\na Wild Life Anti-Poaching Authority shall be established.\nThe Ganga and Yamuna rivers\u2019 cleaning programmes shall\nbe revamped and revitalised. Similar schemes for other\nwater bodies shall also be initiated.\n\nPrasar Bharti\n39. We will review the Prasar Bharti Act. We will also enact\na comprehensive Broadcasting Bill to regulate private\nbroadcasting and to protect Indian interests. We will restrict\nforeign equity holding in private television broadcasting\nto 20% (and prevent cross holding to avoid emergence of\nmonopolies in the media).\n\nA New Norm For Governance by consensus\nScience & Technology\n40. For sustainable national development and the long-overdue\ntransformation of India into a modern, prosperous and\nknowledge-driven nation, we will ensure integration\nof efforts, in the field of science and technology with\ndevelopment programmes in various socio-economic\nsectors. We will further speed up the modernization of\nNational Laboratories, strengthen R&D and establish new\nas well as strengthen existing centres of excellence, so that\nthey continue to constitute an invaluable national asset\nand also become totally immune to policy fluctuations\n\nUntitled-4 134 11/7/2016 8:35:01 PM\n\f\n1999 Manifesto: NDA \u00a2 135\n\nelsewhere.\n\nInformation Technology\n\n41. A new revolution is sweeping the globe \u2014 that of\nInformation Technology. We believe that Information\nTechnology is an important vehicle for future development.\nWe are committed to ensuring that India is full and equal\npartner in its global progress; indeed, that India can be a\nsoftware super power. We will, for that purpose, unveil\na National Informatics Policy with short, medium and\nlong-term perspective.\n\n42. Finally, we are convinced that a nation of nearly 100\ncrore people representing a sixth of humanity cannot be\ngoverned on the arithmetic alone of majority and minority.\nGovernance must become unifying, not divisive, in its\npractice. It is this mindless manner of the domination\nof the majority that has led to bitterness, hostility and\nconfrontation - and has even made the opposition and\nruling parties like permanent adversaries. This destructive\ntrend of politics of negativism and political untouchability\nwhich has distorted our body politic in the last few decades\ncalls for an immediate corrective. We will, therefore,\nstrive to develop national consensus on all major issues\nconfronting the nation by involving the opposition parties\nand all section of society in dialogue. We will also try for\na consensual mode of governance as far as practicable.\nThis National Agenda is a sincere and solemn covenant\naimed at changing the content and culture of governance\nof this great nation, freeing it of the triple curses of hunger\n(bhookh), fear (bhay) and corruption (bhrashtachar), and\ntransforming it into a New India that is prosperous, strong,\nself-confident and at peace with itself and the world. we\nappeal for the cooperation of all parties and all sections\nof society in this great endeavour.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-4 135 11/7/2016 8:35:01 PM\n\f\n136 * 1999 Manifesto: NDA\nConclusion\n\nThis National Agenda is a sincere and solemn covenant aimed at\nchanging the content and culture of governance of this great nation,\nfreeing it of the triple curses of hunger (bhookh), fear (bhay) and\ncorruption (bhrashtachar), and transforming it into a New India\nthat is prosperous, strong, self-confident and at peace with itself\nand the world.

Shanti! Shanti!\nMay all live happily. May all enjoy good health.\nMay all see auspiciousness. May none experience distress.\n\nMay peace prevail everywhere!\n\nTHIS timeless motto of universal happiness and peace is the heritage\nof this ancient Indian civilization, which assumed the character of\nBharatvarsha in Bharat Khand. Here, a nation, which Megasthanes\nnoted \u2018never invaded others and was never invaded,\u2019 existed long\nbefore the ideas of civilization evolved elsewhere.\n\nThis ageless nation is the embodiment of the eternal values\nenshrined in the concept of \u2018Sanatana Dharma\u2019 which, according to\nMaharishi Aurobindo, is synonymous with Indian nationalism. The\nidea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam \u2014world as a family \u2014is integral to\nthe concept of Sanatana Dharma. This gigantic idea is an exclusively\nIndian contribution to world peace. This ancient nation evolved a\nworld-view based on the motto Loka samasta sukhina bhavantu (Let\nthe entire world be happy) thousands of years before any League\nof Nations or United Nations was thought of to avoid global strife.\nThe Indian nation evolved this grand vision not by marching its\narmies and conquering the rest and offering peace; but by the\ninner-directed pursuit of universal values by the Rishis living in\nthe forests and mountains of India.\n\nThe well-being of all, in short, is the Indian mission. It is not\n\nUntitled-5 141 11/7/2016 8:37:49 PM\n\f\n142 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nlimited to the residents of Bharat or the adherents of any particular\nfaith or creed. That is why Bharat received with open arms all faiths\nand people fleeing persecution \u2014 whether it was the Jews, Parsis,\nMuslims or Christians\u2014and preserved and protected them long\nbefore any other civilization could think short of exterminating those\nwho differed from the ruling faiths and people. Israeli society has\nopenly acknowledged that out of over a hundred nations in which\nJews sought refuge, only in Bharat they were received and treated\nwell. It is because religion in ancient India meant faith in general\nand not any particular faith. It is this ancient Indian mind that\nformulated the Constitution of India, guaranteeing equal treatment\nto all faiths and their adherents and it is not the Constitution that\nshaped the Indian mind.\n\nDiversity is an inseparable part of India\u2019s past and present\nnational tradition. The BJP not only respects but celebrates India\u2019s\nregional, caste, credal, linguistic and ethnic diversity, which finds\nits true existence and expression only in our national unity. This\nrich tradition comprises not only the Vedas and Upanishads,\nJainagamas and Tripitaka, Puranas and Guru Granth Sahib, the\nDohas of Kabir, the various social reform movements, saints and\nseers, warriors and writers, sculptors and artists, but also the Indian\ntraditions of the Muslims, Christians and Parsis.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party is a proud inheritor of this\ntradition while all other political parties have branded everything\nassociated with this great tradition as sectarian, unworthy of being\nfollowed. The post-Independence tendency to reject all ancient\nIndian wisdom in political life led to all pre-Independence values\nand symbols \u2014be it the idea of spiritual nationalism expounded\nby Swami Vivekananda, or the concept of Ram Rajya articulated\nby Mahatma Gandhi, or the soul-stirring \u201cVande Mataram\u2019 song\ncomposed by Bankim Chandra being discarded as unsecular and\nunacceptable. The BJP rejects this attitude and idea of disconnecting\nfrom the past. The past is inseverable from the present and the\nfuture. That is why Swami Vivekananda said, \u2018It is out of the past\nthat the future is moulded. It is the past that becomes the future\u2019.\n\nUntitled-5 142 11/7/2016 8:37:49 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 143\n\nBJP\u2019s Vision: An Inheritance From India\u2019s Freedom Movement\n\nTHE BJP shares, embodies and energizes the vision of every\npatriotic Indian to see our beloved country emerge as a strong,\nprosperous and confident nation, occupying her rightful place\nin the international community. It is a vision to see our sacred\nMotherland freed from the scourge of bhookh (hunger), berozgari\n(unemployment), bhay (fear) and bhrashtachar (corruption). Lastly,\nit is a vision to see India, the world\u2019s oldest cradle of civilization,\ntransform itself yet again into a benign global power, contributing\nher material, intellectual, cultural and spiritual energies to\nchange the paradigm at the global level to save the world from\nthe gathering civilizational crisis. As Arnold Toynbee said, \u2018The\nWestern beginning must have an Indian ending if the world is to\nbe saved from destruction.\u2019\n\nIt was this very same vision which inspired millions upon\nmillions of freedom-loving Indians of all castes, communities and\nregions to give their all for the liberation of Mother India from the\nyoke of British colonial rule. It was a vision which all the stalwarts\nof our freedom movement, belonging to different ideological and\npolitical backgrounds, said in their own separate yet complementary\nways. Mahatma Gandhi coined a uniquely Indian idiom\u2014\u2018Ram\nRajya\u2019 \u2014for this common national vision, emphasizing, as a\ncautionary direction to future rulers of India that, \u2018There can be no\nRam Rajya in the present state of inequalities in which a few roll\nin riches and the masses do not get even enough to eat.\u2019\n\nThe Context and the Issue in the 12th Lok Sabha Poll\n\nTHE general elections to the 12th Lok Sabha is the inevitable\nresult of the instability forced on the country by the Congress and\nthe United Front. The two formed a negative and opportunist\ncombination to thwart the mandate of the people in the 11th Lok\nSabha poll and allowed the rejected Congress Party to do back-\nseat driving. The negative combination was a symbol of instability\nfrom day one and was, for most part of its existence, in intensive\ncare. It collapsed, as it had to and demonstrated how the mischief\nplayed on the people of India after the 11th Lok Sabha poll recoiled\non the mischief-makers themselves. This has made stability the\nprincipal issue in the coming election in a manner it has never\n\nUntitled-5 143 11/7/2016 8:37:49 PM\n\f\n144 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nbeen in our history.\n\nAlso, the election to the 12th Lok Sabha is not only a vote on\nthe despicable record of malgovernance of the two United Front\nregimes spawned by the hung 11th Lok Sabha. Rather, as the last\nparliamentary poll in this century and as one taking place in the\nSwarna Jayanti year of India\u2019s Freedom, it is a vote on nearly five\ndecades of misrule by the Congress and its clones.\n\nThe BJP and its allies have entered the electoral fray with\nthe supreme confidence of winning a clear mandate from the\npeople of India to rule for the next five years. This mandate will\nbe a vote not only against the rank instability of the two United\nFront Governments, but also against the static, anti-people, anti-\ndevelopment \u2018stability\u2019 of the previous Congress Governments.\nAt the same time, it will be a positive vote for the BJP\u2019s solemn\npledge to provide a dynamic, pro-people, pro-development, anti-\nstatus quoist stability under the able Prime Ministership of Shri\nAtal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nShri Atal Bihari Vajpayee: Ability, Integrity and Universal\nAcceptability\n\nTHE positive vote for the BJP is grounded in our philosophy,\nour policies, our programmatic commitments, the performance of\nour State Governments and, of course, the unimpeachable personal\nqualities of our top leadership. In Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the\npeople see a leader who combines ability with integrity, charisma\nwith character and experience with universal acceptability. He is\nnot a person who claims leadership by birth in, or relationship with,\nany dynasty. He is a leader by virtue of his long and dedicated\nservice of the nation and its people in and out of Parliament.\n\nUnder Shri Vajpayee\u2019s leadership, the BJP and its allies, if\nelected to power, will marshal the requisite will to chart the way\ntowards the fulfillment of the unfinished agenda of transition from\nSwaraj to Su-raj.\n\nThis Election Manifesto outlines how the BJP will effect change\nwith continuity. It asserts the principles and beliefs that will serve\nas the beacon and an internal watchdog for the BJP in governance.\nThe five-fold concept of Shuchita (probity in public life), Suraksha\n(security), Swadeshi (economic nationalism), Samajik Samarasata\n\nUntitled-5 144 11/7/2016 8:37:50 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 145\n\n(social harmony) and Hindutva (cultural nationalism) will constitute\nthe core content and ideological pillars of the BJP. These principles\nwill be manifest in our commitment to national security, good\ngovernance, national unity and integration, democracy, genuine\nsecularism, eradication of mass poverty, opportunity for economic\nadvancement for all, social justice, gender justice, harmonious\nCentre-State relations, probity in public life, revival of institutions,\npolitics of consensus and cooperation as against confrontation and,\nlast but not the least, raising India\u2019s prestige, profile and power in\nthe international arena.\n\nThese commitments will guide the BJP in its endeavor to\nprovide a Stable Government under an Able Prime Minister.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 145 11/7/2016 8:37:50 PM\n\f\nOur National Identity\n\nCultural Nationalism\n\nTHE BJP is committed to the concept of \u2018One Nation, One People\nand One Culture\u2019. The unique cultural and social diversity in India\nis woven into a larger civilizational fabric by thousands of years of\ncommon living and common and shared values, beliefs, customs,\nstruggles, joy and sorrow, as well as symbols of high degree of unity\nwithout uniformity. Our nationalist vision is not merely bound by\nthe geographical or political identity of Bharat but it is referred\nby our timeless cultural heritage. This cultural heritage which is\ncentral to all regions, religions and languages, is a civilizational\nidentity and constitutes the cultural nationalism of India which is\nthe core of Hindutva. This we believe is the identity of our ancient\nnation \u2018Bharatvarsha\u2019.\n\nEvery effort to characterize Hindutva as a sectarian or exclusive\nidea has failed as the people of India have repeatedly rejected such a\nview and the Supreme Court, too, finally endorsed the true meaning\nand content of Hindutva as being consistent with the true meaning\nand definition of secularism. In fact, Hindutva accepts as sacred all\nforms of belief and worship. The evolution of Hindutva in politics\nis the antidote to the creation of vote banks and appeasement of\nsectional interests. Hindutva means justice for all.\n\nThe BJP is convinced that Hindutva has immense potentiality\nto re-energize this nation and strengthen and discipline it to\nundertake the arduous task of nation-building. This can and does\ntrigger a higher level of patriotism that can transform the country\nto greater levels of efficiency and performance. It is with such\nintegrative ideas in mind, the BJP joined the Ram Janmabhoomi\nmovement for the construction of Shri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. This\ngreatest mass movement in post-Independence history reoriented\n\nUntitled-5 146 11/7/2016 8:37:50 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 147\n\nthe disoriented polity in India and strengthened the foundation of\ncultural nationalism.\n\nThe BJP is committed to facilitate the construction of a\nmagnificent Shri Ram Mandir at Ram Janmasthan in Ayodhya\nwhere a makeshift temple already exists. Shri Ram lies at the core\nof Indian consciousness. The BJP will explore all consensual, legal\nand constitutional means to facilitate the construction of Shri Ram\nMandir at Ayodhya.\n\nOo\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 147 11/7/2016 8:37:50 PM\n\f\nAgenda for Institutional Rejuvenation\n\nStrengthening Democracy\u2019s Pillars\n\nTHE strength of a democracy is directly proportionate to the\nstrength of the three pillars on which it rests\u2014the Executive, the\nLegislature and the Judiciary. Five decades of misrule and misuse\nof these institutions has eroded their strength. Corruption at the\nhighest levels of the Executive has corroded people\u2019s faith in\nGovernment. The Congress and UF Governments\u2019 inability to take\nfirm decisions and make tough choices, apart from their failure to\nconfront disruptive forces, has weakened the authority of the Indian\nState. Over-centralization of power at the Centre and unbalanced\nmodels of development have led to Centre-State friction. Abuse\nof constitutional provisions like Article 356 and the misuse of Raj\nBhavans as extension counters of the ruling party at the Centre\nhave defiled the sanctity of the country\u2019s Constitution.\n\nThe BJP will earnestly set itself to the task of strengthening\nthese institutions of the Republic through an agenda of reform\nand rejuvenation. The primary task is to restore to the State\u2014and\nthus to Government \u2014its honour and prestige. The BJP will thus\nrestore to Government its moral authority to rule. We propose to\nundertake the following agenda for rejuvenation:\n\nConstitutional Reforms\n1. The BJP will appoint a Commission to comprehensively\nreview the Constitution of India, in the light of the\nexperience of the past 50 years and make suitable\nrecommendations. The Commission will comprise\nconstitutional experts and eminent parliamentarians.\n2. The BJP is committed to take necessary steps to prevent\n\nUntitled-5 148 11/7/2016 8:37:50 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 149\n\nmisuse of Article 356 of the Constitution.\n\n3. The BJP will carve out Uttaranchal, Vananchal, Vidarbha\nand Chhattisgarh as separate States. Delhi will be given\nfull Statehood.\n\n4. The BJP will provide all three regions of Jammu and\nKashmir \u2014Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh\u2014with regional\ndevelopment councils.\n\n5. The BJP will abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution.\n\nElectoral Reforms\nTHE BJP, which has been singularly championing the cause of\nelectoral reforms since the days of the Jana Sangh, believes that one\nof the principal causes of corruption and corrosion of our polity is\nour faulty election process. The BJP will, immediately on assuming\noffice, introduce a comprehensive Electoral Reforms Bill, much of\nthe groundwork for which has already been done but not acted\nupon. To ensure free, fair and fearless elections and to prevent the\nuse of money power and muscle power, the BJP will:\n1. Update and adopt the Goswami Committee Report;\n2. Consider introducing a scheme for State-funding of election\nexpenses incurred by all recognized parties;\n3. Undertake immediate delimitation of Lok Sabha and\nAssembly constituencies;\n4. Make it mandatory for parties to submit audited accounts\nfor public scrutiny;\n5. Examine the feasibility of introducing the list system or a\nmixed system of elections; and;\n6. Undertake the process of issuing multi-purpose identity\ncards to all citizens and make it a mandatory requirement\nfor voting.\n\nJudicial Reforms\n\nTHE Judiciary is one of the watchdogs in a democracy and\nin recent times has played an important role in pursuing cases\nof corruption and abuse of public office. But the Judiciary faces\nproblems that need to be addressed and solved in consultation\nwith the Chief Justice of India. For speedy, fair and inexpensive\njustice, the BJP will:\n\nUntitled-5 149 11/7/2016 8:37:50 PM\n\f\n150 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\n1. Fill vacancies in high courts and the Supreme Court without\nany delay;\n\n2. Appoint special judges to clear the huge arrears at all\nlevels of the judiciary;\n\n3. Legislate to the effect that cases are heard on a day-to-day\nbasis and not held up by inordinate adjournments;\n\n4. Expand and strengthen the existing legal aid facilities for\nweaker sections of society; and,\n\n5. Set up a National Judicial Commission which will\nrecommend judicial appointments in the High Courts\nand the Supreme Court and draw up a code of ethics for\njudges.\n\nReforms in the Law and Order Machinery\n\nTHE security of each citizen is of utmost concern for the BJP,\nwhich is committed to a riot-free and terrorism-free India. Whether\non the streets or at home, every Indian must feel safe and protected\nfrom violence in any form. The BJP will squarely and purposefully\naddress the deteriorating law and order scenario in various parts\nof the country. The BJP will:\n\n1. Forthrightly meet all challenges to the State and its citizens\nby terrorists and extremists. Our approach will be firm\nbut always fair;\n\n2. Enact a suitable law to tackle terrorism while ensuring\nthat there are no loopholes for its misuse;\n\n3. Provide timely assistance to State Governments to maintain\nlaw and order by supplementing local police forces with\nadequate central forces;\n\n4. Equip police with modern arms and communication\nfacilities;\n\n5. Seek immediate reports from State Governments on\nincidents of police firing and monitor follow-up action,\nespecially in fixing of responsibility if the firing was\nunprovoked or uncalled for;\n\n6. Hold district officers squarely accountable for\nmismanagement of public order and take prompt action\nin light of findings of time-bound inquiries;\n\n7. Ensure that complaints by citizens do not go unattended;\n\nUntitled-5 150 11/7/2016 8:37:51 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 151\n\n8. Improve the intelligence-gathering mechanism at all levels\nto tackle mischief-makers before they can act and keep\nState Governments posted about all intelligence gathered\non a day-to-day basis;\n\n9. Launch a nationwide drive to identify the influx of illicit\narms and their possession. Proliferation of small arms\ndirectly affects law and order and the nation\u2019s security;\n\n10. Crack down on narcotics smuggling which is linked to\nnarco-terrorism and drug-usage. Existing law in this regard\nwill be made more effective and implemented;\n\n11. Rationalize the number, structure, composition and role of\nparamilitary and special forces like the National Security,\nthe Special Protection Group and the Rapid Action Force;\nand,\n\n12. Review VIP security arrangements so that they are neither\nexaggerated nor intrusive. We will ensure that VIP security\narrangements do not affect the collective convenience of\nthe citizens.\n\nAdministrative Reforms\n\nTHE BJP believes that despite reduction in the traditional\nregulatory role of the bureaucracy, it will remain vital to the\nprovision of a just and progressive administration; efficient delivery\nof services to the people; and, implementation of socio-economic\ndevelopment programmes. We will strive to re-inculcate in the public\nservice the spirit of service to the common people. Public servants\nat all levels will be given due support and trust. In turn, they will\nbe held fully accountable for efficiency, probity and integrity. To\nusher in a responsive and responsible administration, the BJP will:\n\n1. Ensure objectivity and fairness in recruitment, promotions\nand transfers.\n\n2. Introduce suitable minimum tenures for officers manning\nsuch posts as secretaries to the Government, chief\nsecretaries, DGPs and district officers;\n\n3. Deny extension to officers after superannuation or upon\ncompleting their fixed tenures;\n\n4. Give protection to public servants in the discharge of their\nduties and disallow interference from extraneous quarters;\n\nUntitled-5 151 11/7/2016 8:37:51 PM\n\f\n152 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\n5. Undertake reforms in district administration, police and\nother organizations interfacing with the people, with\nemphasis on responsiveness and accountability;\n\n6. Avoid proliferation of bureaucracy by meeting new\nrequirements, to the extent possible, through redeployment\nand training of existing staff;\n\n7. Give wide publicity to rights of citizens and the services\nand facilities to which they are entitled;\n\n8. Provide speedy redressal of individual and community\ngrievances;\n\n9. Withdraw Government from areas of unnecessary\nintervention;\n\n10. Enhance skills and efficiency of public servants through\nspecial training programmes;\n\n11. Infuse talent through lateral entry of personnel;\n\n12. Ensure speedy resolution of anomalies in implementing\nthe recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission and\nstrengthen arrangements for employees\u2019 welfare and\nhousing;\n\n13. Raise the retirement age of Government employees from\n58 to 60 as per the recommendations of the Fifth Pay\nCommission; and,\n\n14. Increase skills and efficiency of public servants by training\nprogrammes; infusion of talent will also be secured by\nlateral entry of people from the private sector, NGOs and\neducational and research institutions.\n\nRestructuring of Centre-State Relations\nTHE present iniquitous Centre-State relations not only tend\nto erode the autonomy of the States and jeopardize their rightful\nand legitimate role in our federal polity, but also impinge on their\nfinancial capabilities and operational flexibility. To make Centre-\nState relations more harmonious and in keeping with the spirit of\na federal polity, the BJP will:\n1. Immediately implement the recommendations of the\nSarkaria Commission;\n2. Consult State Governments before appointing Governors\nand consider ways and means of preventing misuse of Raj\n\nUntitled-5 152 11/7/2016 8:37:51 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 153\n\nBhavans for political purposes;\n\n3. Increase allocation of resources to the States in real terms.\nThis, coupled with greater functional autonomy, can go a\nlong way in making States stable, strong and prosperous.\nTo achieve this end, we will:\n\n(a) Increase the States\u2019 share of gross proceeds of Central\nTax revenues to 33 per cent;\n\n(b) Give adequate assistance to the States to lessen the\nburden imposed by the recommendations of the Fifth\nPay Commission;\n\n(c) Allow States the freedom to raise funds by issuing\ntax-free bonds;\n\n(d) Transfer external assistance to States on the same terms\nand conditions on which it is received from external\ndonors;\n\n(e) Treat loans against small savings as loans in perpetuity;\n\n(f) Increase Plan assistance to States in real terms;\n\n4. Swiftly clear infrastructure projects in power, water and\nmineral sector. The Central Electricity Authority and\nCentral Water Commission will function as consultancy\norganizations and not have any regulatory role in project\nclearance. The present policy of environmental clearance\nwill be reviewed.\n\nPanchayati Raj\n\nFOR better local self-governance at the village level, the BJP\n\nwill:\n\n1. Introduce suitable changes in the 73rd and 74th amendments\nto the Constitution with a view to further strengthening\nPanchayati Raj institutions and giving them greater\nautonomy;\n\n2. Endeavor to make the Panchayati Raj institutions financially\nself-reliant.\n\nSystemic Cure for Corruption\n\nTHE BJP believes that morality and ethics together form the\nunderpinning of good governance. In the past 50 years, the Congress\nhas systematically dismantled all norms of honesty and integrity\n\nUntitled-5_ 153 11/7/2016 8:37:51 PM\n\f\n154 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\nin Government, indulging in corruption at all levels and resisting\nall attempts to bring the guilty to book. The UF had declared its\nintention to expose the corrupt, but ended up protecting them\nfrom the arms of justice. The BJP will seek to undo this grievous\nwrong committed against the nation by the Congress and later by\nthe UF and set an example of unimpeachable accountability and\nimpeccable probity in public life. For a clean public life, the BJP will:\n\n1. Make it obligatory for every elected representative to\nmake public within 90 days his income and assets, as well\nas those of his/her spouse and dependent children and\nparents. These declarations will be open to public scrutiny\nand have to be made every year;\n\n2. Appoint a Lok Pal to inquire into allegations of corruption\nagainst anybody holding public office, including the Prime\nMinister;\n\n3. Introduce extensive regulations to ensure that conflict of\ninterest does not influence decisions taken by those holding\npublic office;\n\n4. Modify and reform the methodology of Government\napproval of contracts, schemes and large value agreements\nto make them more transparent;\n\n5. The powers of patronage, the discretion to say \u2018Yes\u2019 or\n\u2018No\u2019 to simple daily requirements of the citizens will be\ndone away with;\n\n6. Expeditiously deal with unresolved cases of corruption\nand in which no action has been taken in the last 12 years;\nand,\n\n7. Give greater autonomy to the CBI, in keeping with the\nrecent Supreme Court order, so as to prevent investigating\nagencies from being used to subserve the political designs\nof the ruling party.\n\nRight to Information\n\nTHE BJP believes in taking concrete steps to promote\ntransparency in the functioning of Government as a confidence-\nbuilding measure. The working of a Government should not only be\ntransparent but should be perceived to be so. We, therefore, subscribe\nto the principle of sharing information about the Government's\n\nUntitled-5 154 11/7/2016 8:37:51 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 155\n\nwork. The BJP will:\n1. Enhance public access to information to the maximum\nextent feasible;\n2. Review laws and regulations concerning confidentiality;\nand,\n3. Introduce social audit of development programmes,\nespecially in rural areas.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5_ 155 11/7/2016 8:37:52 PM\n\f\nOur Swadeshi Approach\n\nMaking India a Global Economic Power\n\nTHE economic policy-making in the last five decades has been\nshaped more by dogma than by a rational debate on what suits\nthe country\u2019s interests best. In 1950, Congress discarded the\nGandhian approach and adopted the socialist pattern without\nany debate. Now, after the collapse of the socialist paradigm, our\nentire establishment has defected to the type of free-market system\nthat prevails in the Western countries, once again without any\ndebate as to whether such a system can be wholly transplanted\nto India. The policies of liberalization, particularly globalization,\npursued by the Congress and later by the UF Government have\nresulted in economic stagnation. What this nation needs now is a\npractical approach that is devoid of dogma and is guided wholly by\nconsiderations of national interest and what is appropriate for us.\n\nFifty Years of Wasted Opportunities\n\nIN fact, the five decades of Congress and quasi-Congress rule\nhave been a virtually wasted opportunity. In these fifty years the\nabsolute numbers of people living below the poverty line almost\ndoubled; the Indian economy grew at a mere 3.5 per cent while\nmost of Asia raced ahead towards prosperity. At the same time,\nIndian industry, services and agriculture were largely rendered\ninternationally non-competitive and disadvantaged. During\nmost of this period the BJP and its forerunner, the Bharatiya Jana\nSangh, had been urging a liberal economic regime in which the\nfull creative genius of the Indian people could flower. We opposed\nthe license-permit Raj. We opposed the command economy. We\nopposed senseless central planning. We opposed the inefficient State\n\nUntitled-5 156 11/7/2016 8:37:52 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto \u00b0 157\n\ncapitalism that was promoted at the cost of our entrepreneurial class.\nWe opposed the crony capitalism that came about as a result of the\ncollusion between the politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.\nWe opposed the nationalization of vast areas of the economy. We\nopposed the corruption that inevitably became a part of the system\nthat was created. We continuously opposed the Congress party that\nwas both the creator and then the creature of this corrupt system.\n\nPhony Liberalization: A More Impoverished Economy\n\nAFTER four-and-a-half grossly wasted decades, the Congress\nGovernment of the day woke up to the bankrupt reality, but, under\nthe guise of correcting the past wrongs, actually surrendered to\nIMF conditionalities. With a gun at its head it began to do what it\ndoes best \u2014 double talk. It said it was liberalizing the economy and\nactually gave itself more opportunities for corruption. This phony\nliberalization turned out to be a period of record loot under which\nforeign companies flourished and the Indian ones floundered. Within\nthe first year, as the Finance Minister crowed that the surge in the\nshare market was a sign of confidence in his policies, the bubble\nburst to uncover a scam of record proportions. Foreign companies\nwere allowed to increase their equity at par instead of paying the\nmarket price for additional shares. Over 2,100 companies were\nallowed to raise over Rs. 35,800 crore from the market, mostly at\nunreasonable premia. The markets have since come down to abysmal\nlevels; as a result millions were financially devastated. More than\n600 of these companies, which cumulatively raised over Rs. 10,000\ncrore, have simply disappeared, walking off with the money. The\nCongress Party has no answer for this. Many in the Cabinet were\ndirectly involved in the scams. The then Prime Minister\u2019s office,\ntoo, was not exempt from this taint.\n\nThe last six years, when the much-touted reform has been\nunder way, have been years of extreme difficulty for the common\nman. The wholesale price index of food grains has gone up by over\n70 per cent, which is an effective inflation rate of over 20 per cent.\nInstead of creating prosperity for all, this so-called liberalization\nfurther impoverished the majority with a result that, according\nto the NCAER, 59 per cent of all households now have a monthly\nincome of less than Rs. 1,000 or about Rs. 200 per person which is\n\nUntitled-5_ 157 11/7/2016 8:37:52 PM\n\f\n158 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\nmuch less than the poverty level monthly per capita income of Rs.\n263! By contrast, only 4.1 per cent of all families have an income of\nover Rs. 40,000 per year. A study by Oxfam, while somewhat more\ncharitable as far as the overall figures are concerned, categorically\nstates that rural poverty during the Manmohan Singh years grew\nfrom 35.5 per cent to 48.6 per cent. After this period of so-called\nliberalization and growth, so much hyped by the Congress and\nlater by the quasi-Congress UF Governments, we have become a\nmore impoverished society than before. According to the World\nDevelopment Report, the highest 20 per cent of Indians accounted\nfor 41.3 per cent of the national income, while the bottom 20 per cent\naccounted for a mere 8.8 per cent! The hollowness of the economic\npolicies of the past fifty years and, in particular, of the past seven\nyears stands totally exposed by the glaring inequity and the high\nincidence of poverty.\n\nFrom 1981-82 to 1990-91 industrial production grew at\nan average of 7.8 per cent a year. After five years of so-called\nliberalization it grew at an average of 5.7 per cent. During the\nperiod 1990-96, in a reversal of the previous decade\u2019s performance,\nthe compound growth rate of foodgrain production was 1.7 per\ncent while the population grew at 1.9 per cent. Consequently, the\nper capita availability of cereals, which was 511 grams in 1991,\nhas come down to 464 grams now. It is small wonder that prices\nof cereals alone have gone up by almost 20 per cent in 1996 while\nthose of vegetables have risen by a huge 63.3 per cent. The prices of\nwheat and onions have spiraled while those of luxury cars, mobile\nphones and color TVs have come down. This is indicative of the\nwarped sense of economic and social justice that has been prevailing\nin our country in the past few years. Instead of waking up to the\ndeteriorating foodgrain scenario, successive Governments have\nbeen neglecting agriculture. In 1996-97, the proposed outlay for\nagriculture was Rs. 1,969 crore or Rs. 349 crore over the previous\nyear\u2019s revised estimate. This did not even cover the official inflation\nand the impact of the Pay Commission\u2019s recommendations.\n\nThe Swadeshi Approach: Reforming the Reforms Process\n\nIN 1991, the BJP cautioned the Government to embark upon\ninternal liberalization first and defer globalization. We advocated\n\nUntitled-5 158 11/7/2016 8:37:52 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 159\n\nthe reinstatement of the Swadeshi idea particularly because of\nthe heavily one-sided pro-West WTO in the offing. However, ina\nmatter of five years, the BJP stand on Swadeshi has been vindicated.\n\nSwadeshi simply means \u2018India First\u2019. This is the governing\nprinciple of all nations. Now the idea of Swadeshi is being accepted\nin most quarters, also by the Indian industry. Nevertheless, the\neconomy of India has come under tremendous pressure because\nof misguided tariff reductions and an uneven playing field for\nthe Indian industry. The BJP is fully aware that, when it comes\nto power, it will be inheriting a badly managed economy and a\nbadly directed reform process. The broad agenda of the BJP will\nbe guided by Swadeshi or economic nationalism.\n\nThe fundamental approach of the BJP is that it is imperative to\ndevelop a collective national will and confidence that \u2018India shall\nbe built by Indians\u2019. National development will largely depend\nupon national effort and national capital and savings. Even after\nthe so-called reforms, the share of FDI in national investment is\nless than 2 per cent, that is, out of the total national investment\nof over Rs. 12,30,000 crore, FDI amounted to only Rs. 18,500 crore\nduring the years 1991 to 1996. It is clear that foreign capital will\nbe only of little value to the national economy, though crucial to\nsome sectors like infrastructure.\n\nEvery nation advocates free trade in all global fora, but, in\npractice, they compulsively resort to quotas, tariffs and anti-dumping\nmeasures to protect their national interests. Whether it is the USA\nwhich resorts to Super 301, anti-dumping and high tariff, or it is\nJapan whose market is very difficult to access even now, the story is\nthe same. While the declared agenda is free trade, the undeclared,\nbut actual, agenda is economic nationalism. India, too, must follow\nits own national agenda. This spirit is Swadeshi.\n\nRole of Government in a Liberalized Regime\n\nTHERE is a great misconception about the role of the\nGovernment in a liberalized regime. There is an impression that\nthe Government retreats leaving the hidden hand of the market to\nmanage the economy. Governments all over continue to actively\nmanage and protect their economies, national industry and\nemployment. The paradox is that, the greater the liberalization, the\n\nUntitled-5 159 11/7/2016 8:37:53 PM\n\f\n160 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nmore demanding is the involvement of the Government to protect\nnational industry and employment.\n\nFull Liberalization and Calibrated Globalization\n\nTHE Government and Indian industry need to evolve a\nconsensus on the time span required to enable our industries to\nadjust to the exacting demands of international competition. It means\nrapid, large-scale internal liberalization, but calibrated globalization\nso that the Indian industry gets a period of seven to ten years for\nsubstantial integration with the global economy. On the basis of\nthis consensus, the Government and the industry should work out\na strategy to create an atmosphere of international acceptability\nand manage external relations, particularly with the WTO.\n\nIndia must move carefully and gradually towards integration\nwith the global economy and even as it so does, it must act ina\nmanner that suits its national interest. This strategy recognizes\nthat Indian industry needs a period of transition before it can\ncompete with global players. All policies of tariff reduction and\nlifting of quantitative restrictions will be formulated taking the\nabove facts into accounts, but the objective will be to protect the\nnational economy and national interest like all nations do and not\nto indulge in economic isolationism.\n\nStudy and Appraise the Impact of Reforms on the Economy\n\nTHE process of liberalization and economic reforms needs to\nbe properly strategized from the standpoint of broader national\ninterest and rationally phased in. In doing so, the experience of\nthe Asian nations presently under pressure will also have to be\ntaken into account. As we approach the 21st century, we need to\ninstitute studies and appraise and review the reforms process and\nalso the proposed reforms and redefine the broad contours of the\nnational strategy for the next ten years. Based on the appraisal,\nthe BJP Government will clearly define the contours and schedule\nof the liberalization and reforms. The procedural reforms like\nrectification of corporate law, tax law and other commercial laws will\nbe separated from policy formulation like the policy on insurance\nand pension funds.\n\nUntitled-5 160 11/7/2016 8:37:53 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 161\n\nOur Medium-Term Agenda\n\nTHE broad national agenda of the BJP, containing an illustrative\nlist of important and priority items for preparing the nation for\nfuture challenges, is set out below:\n\n1. India must adopt policies that will enable a sustained 8\nto 9 per cent annual rate of growth of GDP. This would\nmean an agricultural growth of at least 5 per cent a year\nand industrial growth of at least 12 per cent a year. Without\npowering agriculture in a big way, Indian growth rate\ncannot be sustained at higher levels. China, endowed\nwith much less cultivable land and resources, could\nachieve an average agricultural growth of 8 to 10 per cent\na year between 1983 to 1993 and doubled its agricultural\nproduction. India can and should achieve this and more.\nThe agricultural agenda should be designed accordingly.\nA separate agenda for the non-corporate sector, which\naccounts for 40 per cent of the GDP, should also be\npursued to achieve this target of sustained high growth.\nRecognizing the gross neglect of proper strategy in the past,\nour Government will focus on a judicious combination of\ninfrastructure and agriculture to achieve a high trajectory\nof growth.\n\n2. In the next five years, we must become a credible partner\nin Asia\u2019s development process and forge a relationship\non equal terms with the major economic powers of the\nworld \u2014USA, EU and Japan.\n\n3. In the next three years, our Government will strive to\nachieve strong macro-economic fundamentals; fiscal\nrectitude where, more than fiscal deficit, the revenue\ndeficit is controlled; strong and viable balance of payments;\nmonetary policy designed to resist unrealistic fall in\nrupee value; moderate inflation; and credit availability\nto industry.\n\nSome Important and Priority Items for the National Agenda\n1. The Government will formulate a system of voluntary\ncompliance with all direct and indirect tax obligations\nwith test-check assessments of select cases and expedite\n\nUntitled-5 161 11/7/2016 8:37:53 PM\n\f\n162 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nconviction of the defaulters.\n2. The Government will ensure a day-to-day working\nrelationship with Indian industry through a structured\nforum like the MITI in Japan.\n3. Even as the private sector will be encouraged to invest\nin infrastructure, the Government will also invest in\ninfrastructure. The private sector has not been a major\ncontributor in this area. Even in the developed world, the\nshare of the private sector in such development does not\nexceed 30 to 40 per cent. For this purpose, the Government\nwill:\n\u00a2 Access the long-term debt market in Insurance and\nPension Funds.\n\n\u00a2 Set up national-level regulatory bodies for different\nareas of infrastructure.\n\n\u00a2 Bring about more transparency, institute contracts\nwhich are easily enforceable and formulate laws that\nsimplify the procedures.\n\nIt will also:\n\n\u00a2 Cut non-productive expenditure;\n\n\u00a2 Disinvest in non-strategic PSUs;\n\n\u00a2 Control and rationalize subsidies and trim all except\nthose that benefit the weaker sections;\n\n\u00a2 Reduce the size of the Government; and,\n\n\u00a2 Simplify tax laws and widen the tax net.\n\n4. The Government will institute an effective anti-dumping\nmachinery to prevent dumping from abroad and to prevent\nunfair anti-dumping action against the country.\n\n5. The Government will ensure that a climate of competition\nis created in the insurance sector \u2014if need be, by involving\nIndian private sector in the insurance business.\n\n6. The Government will rationalize the banking sector by\ncreating specialization in unit banking, retail banking and\ncommercial banking. This will be done by consolidation and\nmergers to create global-size banks and promote efficiency\nand profitability to strengthen the Indian banking system.\n\nUntitled-5 162 11/7/2016 8:37:53 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 163\n\nResource Generation: Fiscal Policy and the Promotion of Savings\n\nAll the above tasks will need large-scale resource mobilization.\nThis will not only call for the widening of the tax base but also\nsupplementing it with non-tax revenues. The BJP Government shall\ninnovate such resource augmentation through motivated savings.\nThe fiscal policy will aim to prevent the generation of black money.\nTax on services will be reviewed.\n\nWe will structure a fiscal policy that will help generate a\nhigher level of savings. We will aim to increase the savings rate\nto 30 per cent in the next five years. Acceleration of savings will\nrequire the elimination of dissavings, which, in its wake, will\nprune the size of Government and the public sector and generate\nthe much-needed resources for attending to the highly neglected\nareas of social infrastructure like education and public health.\nLike physical infrastructure, social infrastructure will be a priority\non the agenda of the BJP Government. In their abortive zeal for\ncontaining the fiscal deficit, previous Governments have cut plan\nexpenditure drastically and, instead, increased revenue expenditure\nin unpruned regulatory arms of Government which have outlived\ntheir utility in the era of liberalization. This trend will be reversed\nand it is expected that the reactivation of public expenditure will\npull the economy out of demand stagnation and recession. It should\nbe recognized that the halt in public investment in infrastructure,\nboth physical and social, in the fond hope that did not materialize,\nof the private sector making good the gap, has caused undue harm\nto the economy.\n\nEradication of Poverty Through Generation of Jobs\n\nTHE above strategy is also firmly rooted in the recognition\nthat growth cannot be sustained in the backdrop of accentuation in\npoverty and human misery. Poverty cannot also be wished away\nthrough an abstract definition built on calorific value. A meaningful\nestimation of poverty will now be structured on the matrix of factors\nthat dilute the quality of life such as illiteracy, lack of sustained\nemployment, malnutrition, lack of shelter, safe drinking water,\nsanitation and health care. The lot of the poor, thus defined, will\nbe improved through a multi-pronged approach, with the focus\non increased employment opportunities. The BJP Government will\n\nUntitled-5 163 11/7/2016 8:37:53 PM\n\f\n164 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nmake the Ninth Plan itself an employment-focused Plan.\n\nThe development strategy followed in the last fifty years\nseparates development from employment, treating human beings\nas fodder in the process of development. Employment has only\nreceived lip service in the economic plans; in effect it has received\na very low priority. Employment has been treated as a by-product\nand not the main goal of development. It has been more so since\n1991 under the half-baked reform philosophy. The all-West model\nof the reforms generates only jobless growth. The BJP believes\nthat it is only through full employment\u2014not just any kind of\nemployment, but gainful and productive employment \u2014 that rapid\nand sustainable development is possible. It is through employment\nthat the real purpose of development, namely, the raising of the\nliving standards and dignity of the people, can be realized.\n\nIt is distressing to note that unemployment and\nunderemployment and, consequently, poverty-prevails in our\ncountry on such a massive scale. Even when the GDP growth\nrates have increased, employment growth rates have declined\nin agriculture as well as in industry. The prevailing employment\ngrowth rate is less than half of the rate at which addition to the\nlabour force takes place. The BJP will review the Ninth Plan in\nall its aspects, with the objective of installing employment as its\ncentrepiece. In the next ten years, over 10 crore people will be\nprovided jobs, besides ameliorating the extensive underemployment\nand concealed unemployment. Our strategy will consist of the\n\nfollowing:\n1. A substantially higher growth rate of GDP of 8 to 9 per\ncent;\n\n2. Emphasis on sectors which offer large potential for\nemployment, including small-scale, artisan-based and\nrural industries, infrastructure, housing (urban and rural),\nconstruction, agriculture, wasteland development and\nforestry and labour-intensive production;\n\n3. Opting for projects and technologies, wherever choices\nexist, without reducing productivity, that offer larger\nemployment;\n\n4. Increasing productivity in the informal sector through the\nsupport of technology, credit and marketing;\n\nUntitled-5 164 11/7/2016 8:37:54 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 165\n\n5. Redesigning the special employment programmes \u2014\nIntegrated Rural Development Programme, Jawahar Rozgar\nYojana, Nehru Rozgar Yojana, Scheme for self-employment\nof the Educated Youth, etc.\u2014to increase their coverage\nand effectiveness;\n\n6. Encouraging the employment of women;\n\n7. Fully involving the private sector and non-governmental\norganizations;\n\n8. Adopting the institutional approach of cooperatives,\nwherever possible;\n\n9. Implementing the special employment programmes through\npanchayat institutions; and,\n\n10. Vocational training.\n\nOur Commitment: Removal of Hunger and Ensuring Food for All\n\nIN this fiftieth year of Indian independence, we commit\nourselves to freeing India of the scourge of hunger. The Indian\nsocial traditions abhor hunger and had instituted different social,\nreligious and cultural mechanisms to eliminate hunger. The tradition\nwhich acted as a social security against hunger weakened with\nthe advent of colonialism and it never revived after we attained\nfreedom. The result is that hunger has become part of Indian social\nlife. We have to and we shall, ensure that in this land, no one is\nobliged to sleep on a hungry stomach. For this purpose, we shall\nexplore and encourage all possible ways, both Governmental and\nsocietal, of ensuring food for all. As a concomitant of food for all,\nwe shall recast the agricultural policy of the country to increase\nfood production so that India once again becomes the land of\nabundance in food in next five years.\n\nPublic Sector Reforms\n\nCUTTING down of dissavings will be possible only by pruning\nthe public sector and confining it to sensitive areas where the\nnation\u2019s physical or economic security is involved and to residual\nareas where the presence of public sector is necessary for providing\na moderating or counterpoising role to the ill effects, if any, of\nan unchecked private sector. The minimal public sector will be\nmanaged professionally, with least interference by Government.\n\nUntitled-5 165 11/7/2016 8:37:54 PM\n\f\n166 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nWhile pruning the public sector, it will be ensured that the interests\nof workers are duly taken care of. Greater emphasis will be placed\non retraining and redeployment aspects of the National Renewal\nFund rather than confining its scope to retrenchment.\n\nRole of Foreign Direct Investment\n\nIT is needless to add that national development will be\nlargely funded by capital generated within the country and foreign\ninvestment will play only a small role. The percentage of FDI to\ntotal investment in India during the years 1991-96 is less than 2\nper cent and confirms that even in the post-reform period, national\ndevelopment has been almost entirely financed by local capital.\nHowever, in areas like infrastructure (particularly energy, roads\nand ports), promotion of exports and high-technology industries,\nFDI can usefully supplement national efforts. Policies will be\nframed consistent with national interest in respect of FDI. The BJP\nGovernment will ensure that FDI flows into such priority areas and\nnot in areas where the domestic industry is functioning well. The\nBJP Government will frame policies to restrict FDI in non-priority\nareas. FDI will be encouraged to promote exports rather than target\nthe domestic market. FDI is welcome in a non-predatory role in\njoint ventures rather than in 100 per cent subsidiaries. Generally,\nthe role of foreign capital should be in harmony with and advance,\nthe nation\u2019s economic objectives, as also in line with other Asian\ncountries. Again, until the Indian economy reaches a level of\nglobal strength, takeovers of existing Indian companies by foreign\ncompanies will not be encouraged and suitable, transparent rules\nwill be framed to give effect to this policy. Even developed nations\nlike France, Germany and Switzerland have restrictions on the\ntakeover of domestic companies.\n\nNational Agenda for Bhagidari Sector (Un-incorporated Sector)\n\nAN analysis of India\u2019s GDP shows that agricultural accounts\nfor 27 per cent; corporate sector 12 per cent; and the Government\nsector 21 per cent; all adding up to 60 per cent. The balance 40 per\ncent of the GDP comes from the largest segment of our economy \u2014 the\nunincorporated sector (partnership/ proprietorship firms) which\nbore the brunt of the license-permit quota raj at the cutting edge\n\nUntitled-5 166 11/7/2016 8:37:54 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 167\n\nof its interaction with the organs of State power. Millions of un-\nincorporated enterprises in the country contributing 40 per cent\nof our national income did not deserve even a small paragraph in\nour Economic Surveys and Reserve Bank reports.\n\nThis most important segment has so far commanded the least\nattention and virtually no legitimacy. The entire establishment\nignored these unincorporated enterprises which have a share of\nnearly 50 per cent of national income in the manufacturing sector,\na share of 60 per cent in the construction sector, a share of more\nthan 75 per cent in the transport sector, nearly 90 per cent in the\ntrade sector, more than 80 per cent in hotels and restaurants and\nnearly 100 per cent in the business and other services like that of a\ndoctor, lawyer, accountant, goldsmith, plumber, porter, mechanic,\nelectrician, tailor, barber, carpenter, driver, priest, cook, musician\nand in the crafts and professions. We neglected this sector (which\nis clubbed as part of households in our savings statistics) which\nconstitute the largest segment of savers contributing around 60 per\ncent of our national savings. During 1990-96 out of the total gross\ndomestic savings of Rs. 11,32,029 crore, the savings by household\nsector was Rs. 8,94,918 crore, i.e. nearly 80 per cent and the Bhagidari\nsector is the largest segment of the household sector other than\nthe salary earners.\n\nAny agenda for reform necessarily has to focus its attention on\nthe largest segment of our economy which was also the least cared\nfor during the inspector-raj nurtured by the socialistic regime. But\nthe so-called reforms of the nineties did not address the serious\nissues of using the phenomenal and enormous savings rate of our\nmiddle-class.\n\nThe focus of the Government in the nineties, in the name\nof reforms, concentrated essentially on the corporate sector and\nforeign investment that came a cropper. A clear understanding and\na broad national agenda, with the following measures, are needed\nfor the Bhagidari sector.\n\n(a) The financing cost for this sector is phenomenal and they\nborrow at usurious interest rates. There is no exclusive,\nnational-level financing agency for trade activities or for\nconstruction activities. Indian private-sector banks need\nto be encouraged and developed in these areas and the\n\nUntitled-5 167 11/7/2016 8:37:54 PM\n\f\n168 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nGovernment policies should facilitate the same. A separate\ndevelopment bank for this sector will also be considered.\n\n(b) There is no social security net for this sector. With changing\npatterns in the joint family system, there is even more\nnecessity to introduce the same. The Indian private sector\ninsurance companies can provide this. Unless and until the\nsocial security net is developed for this sector (of course,\nfrom the contributions of this sector), economic reforms\nwill be a castle built on American sands and the European\nair, but not on Indian soil.\n\n(c) In order to mobilize savings of this sectors for targeted\npoverty alleviation programmes, it would be desirable that\nfull deduction is given for the traditional commitments of\nthe sector, including family obligation and contribution of\nthis sector for temples, mosque, gurudwaras, etc. where\nfree food is provided to poor people daily. This would\nreduce the leakages in the anti-poverty schemes currently\nundertaken, since this method would directly deal with\nthe target groups. Local citizens committee can monitor\nthis. The fear of God is a more powerful authority than\nthat of the Government in a country like India.\n\n(d) This sector is a target for all levels of the State machinery\nlike politicians, policemen, tax officials and municipal\nauthorities. A national-level awareness programme of this\nsector\u2019s contribution and a national-level law to guard\nthem against State excesses should also be formulated.\n\nThis sector has the greatest potentiality to grow with a\n\nquantum jump if this agenda is implemented. Any attempt to\nincrease employment and to eradicate unemployment must begin\nhere. This sector at once provides self-employment and multiplies\nemployment. This single sector has the greatest potentiality to\nattack unemployment, poverty and hunger.\n\nRole of Non-Banking Finance Companies\n\nTHE BJP realizes that savings, banking and finance is in\nthe Indian blood. There are tens of thousands of private finance\ninstitutions-nidhis, chits and other native methods of augmenting\nfinance and also modern-day non-banking finance institutions. The\n\nUntitled-5 168 11/7/2016 8:37:55 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 169\n\nBJP views this sector as a potentially important one. The policy on\nNBFCs has been ad-hoc and they have been dealt with, at times,\nin a reckless manner. The new RBI guidelines preventing NBFCs\nfrom accepting deposits without rating is absurd, as we have not\neven developed standards for rating under Indian conditions. The\nBJP will review the entire regulation on the NBFCs and bring about\nan orderly growth and not planned destruction of this important\nsegment. This sector alone finances most of the transportation\nbusiness and the non-corporate sector, which is the most important\nand the largest sector of the national economy.\n\nIndustrial Policy Reform\n\nTHE immediate task of the new Government will have to\nbe to create conditions for industry to regain its lost momentum.\nPersistence of the present conditions will cause irreparable damage\nto the fabric of Indian industry. The BJP recognizes the need for\ncorrective action on a war footing. We attach particular importance\nto the interdependence of industry and agriculture. We will improve\ninter-sectoral terms of trade and other linkages so that benefits\naccrue to both. The BJP also reiterates the importance of the small-\nscale and cottage industry sectors, in view of their contribution\nto employment, wider participation and new entrepreneurship.\nThese sectors, which have suffered neglect by the Congress and\nthe United Front Governments, will be given all encouragement\nand support by the BJP.\n\nThe permit-quota raj created conflicts between large and\nsmall industries. The BJP will strive to make small-scale units and\nlarge units, particularly where the former is the supplier of the\nlatter, into a structured ally like in Japan and Korea. The BJP will\nformulate policies for large units to invest up to 25 per cent in the\ncapital of the small unit so that the small unit has the backing of\nthe large unit for purposes of availing bank loans or other credit.\nBy such a relationship, hundreds of small units can coalesce with\na large-scale unit and benefit in a variety of ways.\n\nIn order to achieve the above objective, the BJP will:\n\n1. Further simplify industrial approvals and remove the\n\nplethora of restrictive controls that now exist. The Industrial\nDevelopment and Regulation Act will be replaced by an\n\nUntitled-5_ 169 11/7/2016 8:37:55 PM\n\f\n170 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\nIndustrial Development Act. The role of the Government\nwill change from the restrictive, as it has been so far, to\none of extending support and encouragement;\n\n2. Encourage research and development in enterprises as\nwell as in specialized institutions;\n\n3. Permit hazardous industries only in specified areas. Separate\nsatellite industrial parks will be set up exclusively for such\nunits;\n\n4. Give all encouragement and support to the small-scale and\ncottage industry sectors. Agencies will be established to\ngive them help in getting scarce raw materials, technology\nupgradation and marketing of their products. Flow of credit\nto these sectors will be enhanced. We will reconsider the\nAbid Hussain Committee recommendations on SSI units\nin the light of the difficulties and apprehensions of SSI.\nThe investment limit of Rs. 3 crore will also be reviewed\nif any misuse of the higher limit is found. The tiny sector\nwill be relieved of labour laws and other legislations by\nwhich they are subject to harassment; and,\n\n5. Ensure a healthy capital market with the twin objectives\nof increasing capital investment in the corporate sector\nand of providing protection to the investing public.\n\nMaking Labour a Proud Partner in the Nation\u2019s Progress\nOUR plan to reform the reform process through the Swadeshi\napproach, includes:\n\n1. Astrong commitment to make labour, both organized and\nunorganized, an equal and proud partner in the nation\u2019s\nprogress;\n\n2. Rationalize and simplify labour laws.\n\nRecognize trade unions on the basis of secret ballot.\n\n4. Introduce worker-participation from the shopfloor to the\nboardroom.\n\n5. Strengthen institutional mechanisms to ensure speedy,\njust and corruption-free redressal of labour grievances.\n\n\u00bb\n\nUntitled-5 170 11/7/2016 8:37:55 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 171\n\nPolicy on Tourism\n\nTHE BJP recognizes the importance of tourism as a generator\n\nof jobs and foreign exchange. Its Government will:\n\n1. Promote tourism as a way to have a more meaningful and\nwider understanding of India and its people.\n\n2. Evolve a national policy for tourism to provide needed\ninfrastructure such as hotels, transports and removal of\nbureaucratic impediments.\n\n3. Create a regulatory mechanism to avoid long-term damage\nto the heritage and the environment.\n\n4. Take care of the pilgrimage component of tourism by\nensuring the cleanliness, basic facilities, etc. at pilgrimage\ncentres of all sects.\n\n5. Shift the exclusive emphasis from five-star tourism to\ntourism for the masses.\n\n6. Enable India to have its rightful share in the growing global\ntourism industry, while ensuring that Indian culture,\nheritage and values are preserved and projected.\n\nPolicy on Infrastructure\n\nSINCE infrastructure constitutes a critical aspect of the national\neconomy, an overview of the BJP\u2019s thinking on infrastructure is\npresented under:\n\nPolicy on Energy and Power\n\nINVESTMENT in power must be accelerated urgently. Any\nfurther delay in adding new capacity will inflict considerable costs\non the economy.\n\n1. In power generation, most of the private sector investments\nhave got bogged down in never-ending negotiations. The\nGovernment will ensure that all eight \u2018fast track\u2019 projects\nstart construction in 1998.\n\n2. Transmission and distribution need to be strengthened.\nAfter appropriate study, a National and/or Regional\nPower Trading Corporation may be set up for efficient\nuse of the generated power. Power Grid Corporation\u2019s\nplans to implement a national grid will be speeded up. To\nensure that private investors in this sub-sector do not have\n\nUntitled-5 171 11/7/2016 8:37:55 PM\n\f\n172 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\nthe same experience as their counterparts in generation,\nthe Government will create a standardized application\nprocedure with clear and transparent rules for their entry;\n\n3. The Government will strive for a national consensus to\nensure that, in five years, a commercially viable power\ntariff structure comes into operation;\n\n4. BHEL will be revitalized to expand its capacity to emerge\nas a global player in the next five years;\n\n5. The Government will review the liquid fuel policy and\ninstitute a more efficient and fair policy regime;\n\n6. To encourage non-conventional sources of energy, the\nMinistry of Non-conventional Energy Sources and IREDA\nwill be strengthened. Large-scale research and development\nwill be instituted to develop more non-conventional energy;\n\n7. Other things being equal, preference will be given to Indian\ncompanies in power generation and distribution;\n\n8. The long-stalled nuclear power programme will be\nrestarted. India has mastered the technology and the entire\nnuclear fuel cycle. There is no reason why only two nuclear\nplants have gone critical in the last seven years. Instead\nof importing nuclear power technology from Russia,\nthere is no reason why our trained engineers should not\nbe exporting Indian nuclear power technology to foreign\ncountries;\n\n9. In the oil sector, the Government will involve the Indian\nprivate sector in oil extraction and refining on the explored\noil fields and will, on viable terms, allow Indian joint\nventures with foreign companies in oil exploration and\nextraction; and,\n\n10. In the coal sector, the Government will increase the\nproduction of coal, reduce costs and raise productivity.\nIt will involve the Indian private sector in coal mining so\nas to meet the increased energy needs of the country.\n\nRailways\n\nTRANSPORT must become multi-modal to meet the needs of\ndevelopment. The most important type of transport is the Indian\nRailways. The rate of growth of the Railways has come down. A\n\nUntitled-5 172 11/7/2016 8:37:56 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 173\n\ncomplete review of the working of the Indian Railways would have\nto be undertaken along with a study of the use of roads in the areas\nserved by the Railways. There are thousands of kilometers of rail\ntrack lying unused, while the roads alongside those very tracks\nare overburdened with traffic, despite Railways being cheaper.\n1. Private participation in using such idle railway tracks will\nbe allowed;\n2. An efficiency audit of the Railways will have to be done\nto prevent wastage and disuse of stores and rolling stock;\n3. Also, a study should be done to ensure that trains carry\npayloads up to 4,000 tonnes;\n4. We will institute research and development for the Indian\nRailways suited to Indian conditions.;\n5. Container transport will be encouraged on a point-to-point\nbasis; and,\n6. The Railways will also run pilgrimage specials connecting\nthe several places of pilgrimage in the country both from\na commercial point of view and service to the pilgrims,\nas well as from the standpoint of national integration.\n\nRoads and Bridges\n\nINADEQUATE road networks have led to higher transportation\ncosts that have also eroded the international competitiveness of the\nIndian economy. Trucks in India travel only 200-250 kilometers a\nday, compared to 500-600 kilometers a day in developed countries.\nTherefore, proper road construction will lead to a big increase in\ntransport efficiency. For this purpose, the BJP will do the following\nthings:\n\n1. The National Highways Authority of India will be made\nthe regulator for this sector. It will be responsible for setting\ntolls, inviting bids from private companies, evaluating\nthem and awarding them. The BJP will continue with the\ncurrent fiscal incentives for this sector. Like in other sectors,\nit will identify the non-fiscal barriers to investment in this\nsector, for their speedy removal;\n\n2. The Government will identify the four most heavily used\nstretches of the national highway system. It will formulate\nand implement an action plan to upgrade them within two\n\nUntitled-5 173 11/7/2016 8:37:56 PM\n\f\n174 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\nyears using both the public and private sectors wherever\nnecessary. It is important that these critical bottlenecks be\nremoved as soon as possible;\n\n3. For all other highways, the Government will invite the\nprivate sector to upgrade them, for which they will collect\ntoll revenues. If the private sector is not interested, the\nGovernment will create a State-owned National Highway\nDevelopment Corporation that will go ahead and upgrade\nthese highways, for which it will also levy tolls;\n\n4. A proportion of the taxes on motor vehicles and on petrol\nand diesel collected in each city will be handed over to that\ncity or town to use to upgrade the roads in those cities;\nand,\n\n5. Except for very long distance and high investment projects,\nthe policy will be to involve only the Indian private sector\nin the bids.\n\nInland Waterways\n\nTHERE is an enormous potential for inland waterways in\nIndia. The estimated length of waterways available is over 30,000\nkilometers and they touch almost all the important centres in our\ncountry. The cost of water transport is a third of the cost of surface\ntransport. Waterways were once considered to be better for India\nthan other forms of transport in many areas. The development of\nwaterways will also lead to the proper maintenance of reservoirs\nand canals, since revenue would be generated from water transport.\nThe BJP will develop a blueprint for water transport and allow\nprivate parties to get into inland water transport.\n\nSea Ports\n\nMOST Indian ports are operating at more than 100 per cent\ncapacity. Yet they are very inefficient when compared to other parts\nin the region. As part of a proper ports development programme,\nthe BJP will do the following things:\n\n1. Convert ports into companies that can raise funds from\nthe debt and equity markets. The initial shareholding of\nthis company can be divided four ways with the central\nGovernment, the State Government, the city administration\n\nUntitled-5 174 11/7/2016 8:37:56 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 175\n\nand the general public;\n\n2. Ports will be encouraged to invest in the latest information\ntechnology and cargo handling equipment to reduce\nturnaround time;\n\n3. The workers of ports should be retrained to use these new\ntechnologies. Ports must be more efficient, but they need\nto become so without displacing too many workers;\n\n4. Develop Mumbai and Vishakhapatnam ports as megaports,\nwhich will be warehouses for the country on either\nseaboard;\n\n5. Private sector minor ports should be encouraged. They\nwill take the load of the bigger ports; and\n\n6. Except for large international ports, in other cases,\npreference will be given to Indian companies.\n\nCoastal Shipping\n\nINDIA has a long coastline and its peninsular formation is\nideally suited for development of coastal shipping. Considering\nthat coastal shipping is cheaper than surface transport and further\nconsidering that nearly 30 per cent of the cargo carried by Indian\nRailways is coal, coastal shipping can relieve the surface transport\nsector of a big burden. Indian private sector will be involved in\ncoastal shipping development. Cheaper movement of coal by\ncoastal shipping will also enable thermal power generation along\nthe coastline to transmit power inland.\n\nTelecommunications\nThe aim of our telecom policy will be to:\n\n1. Increase the number of phone lines dramatically, especially\nin villages; and,\n\n2. Satisfy the more demanding audio, video and data\ncommunications needs of business and homes.\n\nFor these purposes, the BJP Government will take the following\nsteps:\n\n1. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 will be replaced with new\nlegislation that takes into account the advances in the last\ncentury and more and reflects the current and future status\nof the telecom sector;\n\n2. The Government's role will be that of a regulator, so the\nTelecom Regulatory Authority of India will be strengthened;\n\nUntitled-5_ 175 11/7/2016 8:37:56 PM\n\f\n176 * 1998 Manifesto\n\n3. The department of telecom will be converted into a\ncompany called India Telecom. To expedite the shift from\na Government department to a profit-making company,\nthe Government will divest a portion of its shareholdings\nin India Telecom at the appropriate time;\n\n4. The Government will not discriminate between Government-\nowned companies or the new private companies coming\ninto operation. All restrictions (inter-circle, long-distance,\ninternational) will be removed on schedule, or earlier, in\nthe interests of greater competition;\n\n5. However, the Government will maximize the returns from\nthe companies that it already owns (India Telecom, VSNL,\nMINL, ITI). To make these telecom companies competitive,\nthey need to have the freedom to hire the best people and\npay them market salaries. These companies will be given\nthis freedom;\n\n6. Since India is expected to have the sixth-largest number\nof phones in the world in the next few years, it must have\na telecom-manufacturing industry to match this. The\nGovernment will encourage the creation of world-class\ntelecom-manufacturing in India, that is encouraged to use\nindigenously developed technology; and,\n\n7. The Government policy for foreign direct investment will\ndiscourage foreign majority holdings in telecommunication\ncompanies.\n\nThe BJP\u2019s Approach to the WTO\n\n1. The major task facing our country in the economic sphere\nis the preservation of a measure of autonomy in the\nmanagement of the national economy, which the Congress\nGovernment surrendered meekly by accepting without\nresistance the highly prejudicial WTO conditionalities. The\nGovernment should have the sovereign and inalienable\nright to choose its economic system as well as its legal,\nsocial, cultural and political system in accordance with its\nhistoric traditions, national genius and the express will\nof its people. This would be the foremost objective of our\nparty to restore the desired autonomy.\n\nUntitled-5 176 11/7/2016 8:37:57 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 177\n\n2. Agriculture, which concerns the bulk of our people and,\nin particular, WTO issues connected with subsidies,\nfertilizers and seeds so that the interests of the farmer and\nconsumer of food are not sacrificed would be adequately\nexamined. No legislations concerning agriculture and\ncommitments under the Uruguay Round would be allowed\nto be implemented without full democratic discussion.\n\n3. The small-scale sector, which is the backbone of our\neconomy and employment would not be exposed to\nunequal competition, both from large houses in the country\nand from the transnational corporations from abroad. The\nsmall-scale sector would be strengthened.\n\n4. The agreement on services, particularly financial services,\nwould be monitored in respect of the entry of powerful\nforeign interests in our country. The immigration laws\nabroad should also not confuse rights of the developed\ncountries for effective opportunities for our people in those\ncountries.\n\n5. The patent system, in particular, would not be allowed\nto become an import monopoly and working of a patent\nand dissemination of technology would be ensured by\nan effective and strong \u2018license of right\u2019 and \u2018compulsory\nlicense\u2019 regime.\n\n6. The BJP would strive to work out a strategy and consensus\nwithin the nation and with all nations similarly placed\nto lobby for legitimately justified modification of the\nperspective, programmes, rules and schedule of the WTO.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-S_ 177 11/7/2016 8:37:57 PM\n\f\nSocial Infrastructure\nA Better Standard of Living is Every Indian\u2019s Birthright\n\nDESPITE various programmes launched at various points of time\nand although food production has touched 195 million tonnes from\na low of 50 million tonnes in 1951, India still loses 11 per cent of\nunder five children and 3 to 4 per cent women in the reproductive\nage group due to malnutrition. It is a reflection of the performance\nof previous Governments that 53 per cent of the country\u2019s children\naged under five are malnourished. India has an abysmal record of\n28 per cent low birth weight babies. Fifty per cent of the population\nsuffers from iron deficiency and 20 per cent of all maternal deaths\nare due to anemia. To wipe out these shameful figures, the BJP will:\n1. Ensure household food security commensurate with the\nnational food security so that all families in rural and\nurban areas get two square meals a day by the year 2003;\n2. Review and vigorously implement the National Nutrition\nPolicy and the Plan of Action on Nutrition so that all goals\nare achieved by their target dates;\n3. Revamp and expand the scope of Integrated Child\nDevelopment Services; and,\n4. Use the PDS effectively to help the poorest of the poor.\n\nHousing for All: A New Habitat Policy\n\nTHE BJP recognizes that soon one-third of India\u2019s population\nwill be living in urban centres. It is important to ensure planned\ndevelopment of these centres from small towns to the big cities\nand the large metropolises. Urban slums are rapidly developing\nand conditions in them deteriorating. Particularly important are\nthe problems of drinking water, sewage and waste disposal in\n\nUntitled-S 178 11/7/2016 8:37:57 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 179\n\nurban centres. There is a severe shortage of housing both in the\nurban and rural areas. For us, shelter is a basic human need that\nmust be met at all cost. Extensive housing schemes also generate\nemployment. Therefore, the BJP will:\n\n1. Evolvea National Housing and Habitat Policy in consultation\nwith State Governments and Urban Development\nAuthorities. The policy will aim at providing shelter to\nall by year 2010 and also facilitate the construction of 20\nlakh new houses each year;\n\n2. Review the provisions of the Urban Land Ceiling Act and\nensure that land and property prices do not escalate as\nthey have in the past;\n\n3. Promote affordable mass housing for low and middle-\nincome groups;\n\n4. Make available adequate credit to house-seekers on\nattractive terms;\n\n5. Take steps to make additional rented accommodation\navailable; and\n\n6. Launch special concessional schemes to provide rural poor\nwith adequate and affordable housing.\n\nHealth for All\nOUR goal will be \u2018Health for All\u2019 by 2003, but the poor and\ndisadvantaged will be a special responsibility. Health delivery is\nmost effective when decentralized to State, district and local levels,\nwith communities taking leadership and responsibility for health\nand development. In this context, our ancient and local wisdom is\nof greatest importance. Public health cannot be regarded as only a\nconsumer of resource. It is essential for the creation of a good society\nwith high productivity. It is an investment in human resources.\nTowards this end, we will strive for:\n1. Clean drinking water in all villages and slums;\n2. Attaining 100 per cent universal immunization of children\nagainst preventable diseases;\n3. Vigorously attacking eradicable diseases like yaws, leprosy\nand filariasis;\n4. Promoting awareness on cleanliness, sanitation and disease\nprevention;\n\nUntitled-5 179 11/7/2016 8:37:57 PM\n\f\n180 * 1998 Manifesto\n\n5. Emphasizing prevention of diseases and maintenance\nof health which has been the basis of Indian culture and\ncanalizing resources based on this philosophy;\n\n6. Promoting traditional and alternative systems of\nmedicine such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Homeopathy,\nNaturopathy, with particular emphasis on traditional\nwisdom and indigenous knowledge, with full quality\nassurance;\n\n7. Safeguarding traditional medical knowledge and natural\nresources;\n\n8. Spending more on pre-natal and post-natal health care\nprogrammes and thus drastically reducing India\u2019s infant\nmortality rate and under-five mortality rate;\n\n9. Launching an attack through existing programmes relating\nto AIDS, tuberculosis and vector borne diseases like\nmalaria, dengue haemorrhagic fever and kalaazar, with\nspecial attention to elimination of shortfalls/ deficiencies\nin implementation;\n\n10. Introducing health impact assessment in all development\nprojects;\n\n11. Ensuring that essential drugs are available at affordable\nprices;\n\n12. Introducing low-cost health insurance schemes;\n\n13. Providing concessional health care for the aged;\n\n14. Instituting a mechanism to monitor and collate health-\nrelated information and ensure timely intervention through\nsurveillance;\n\n15. Providing every panchayat with a free and truly functional\nbasic healthcare centre, particularly with facilities for\nmother and child care; as well as access to these centres;\n\n16. Making the screening of blood at blood banks mandatory\nand provide for punitive punishment for any violation;\nand,\n\n17. Making doctors, para-medical and non-medical staff at\nGovernment and private hospitals and healthcare centres\naccountable by suitable law.\n\nUntitled-5 180 11/7/2016 8:37:57 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 181\n\nEducation for All\n\nIT is sad that fifty years after independence, the cherished\ngoal of universal primary education enshrined in the Constitution,\nwhich was to have been implemented by 1960, yet remains to\nbe achieved. In recent years, State support for education has\nbeen wholly inadequate. Quality education is fast becoming the\npreserve of the social and economic elite of the country. We hold\nthat education is both a human right and a means to bring about\ntransformation to a dynamic, humane, thinking society. Towards\nthis end, the BJP will:\n\n1. Increase State spending on education progressively to six\nper cent and more of our Gross National Product within\nfive years;\n\n2. Achieve near complete functional literacy in five years,\nparticularly by mobilizing societal participation and full\nliteracy by the year 2010.\n\n3. Launch a nationwide Educational Quality Improvement\nCampaign covering all institutions from primary schools\nto universities;\n\n4. Accord priority to free primary education and enroll the\nhelp of locally-funded non-government organizations\nin this area; also integrate early childhood care and pre-\nprimary education with primary education;\n\n5. Offer incentives in the form of free text books, mid-day\nmeals and nutrition programmes and stipends to check\ndropout rate so that at least 80 per cent children, both boys\nand girls, who enroll, complete primary school education;\n\n6. Introduce self-employment oriented vocational training\nprogrammes at high school level which will also be open\nto working youth interested in skill upgradation;\n\n7. Introduce an anti-cheating law which will be applicable\nto all States and whose abuse will be prevented through\nadequate safeguards; ensure that examinations are held\non time;\n\n8. Set up a special monitoring authority to scrutinize the\nquality of education and remove gender disparity;\n\n9. Ensure autonomy to universities and to colleges under\nthem. Rid them of corruption and other baneful influences.\n\nUntitled-5 181 11/7/2016 8:37:58 PM\n\f\n182 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nEncourage them to mobilize resources for research and\nhigher education and provide academic freedom to our\nscholars, especially in the social sciences;\n\n10. Restore to teachers self-esteem and make teaching a\nrespectable profession;\n\n11. Create centres of educational excellence in our academic\nsystem that can set an example and build self-confidence.\nOur Government will select 10 to 20 centres of higher\nlearning and research that will be supported in all manner\nto make them world class;\n\n12. Take the help of industry to set up more agro-industrial\nand technical institutions that will provide affordable\neducation;\n\n13. Replace the system of capitation fees by loan linked schemes\nand monitor the functioning of private engineering and\nmedical institutions;\n\n14. Launch a scheme for low interest bank loans for meritorious\nstudents who want to go in for higher education;\n\n15. Thwart attempts by dubious, so-called foreign universities,\ncolleges and institutes to open branches in India and\nprevent the outflow of foreign exchange on studies abroad\nunless the course is relevant to our needs and requirements;\n\n16. Provide specialized opportunities for highly talented\nstudents at school level;\n\n17. Introduce agriculture studies as a subject in rural schools;\n\n18. Ensure that traditional knowledge and skills are preserved\nand disseminated;\n\n19. Seek the help of industrial establishments for rapid\nproliferation of technical education;\n\n20. Encourage the enrichment, preservation and development\nof all Indian languages, including Sanskrit and Urdu; and,\n\n21. Encourage greater participation of social and charitable\ninstitutions in expanding the network of educational\ninstitutions and in improving their standards.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 182 11/7/2016 8:37:58 PM\n\f\nOur Agriculture, Our Farmers,\nOur Villages\n\nRevitalized Rural Economy, Revitalized National Economy\n\nAGRICULTURE sustains 71.4 per cent of the nation\u2019s population. It\nis the mainstay of India\u2019s economy and culture. India is blessed with\nevery natural resource needed for sustaining a strong agricultural\neconomy. We have vast cultivable land, ample sources of water,\nforests and most importantly, year-long tropical sunlight. We have a\nlarge agricultural human resource that has inherited a rich and hoary\ntradition in farming. It has also acquired the tools of modern science\nand technology. The combination of these two resources could have\ntransformed Free India into a continental granary. But fifty years\nof neglect, corruption and wrong policies by successive Congress\nand quasi-Congress Governments have severely handicapped the\nIndian farmer and the entire rural economy. \u2018Villager is the salt of\nIndian earth,\u2019 said Mahatma Gandhi. \u2018Jai Kisan\u2019 said Lal Bahadur\nShastri. But in the last five decades, a majority of our kisans have\nbecome poor and harried outcasts in their own country, with no\nrespectful place in the Governments\u2019 scheme of things. Today\nthey are on the margins of India\u2019s economic, social, cultural and\npolitical life.\n\nRural India and Urban India Complement and Supplement Each\nOther\n\nTHE BJP is of the considered view that India will not become\na strong, prosperous and confident nation until and unless there\nis a qualitative improvement in our rural economy and the\ncondition of our kisans. In the absence of any comprehensive and\n\nUntitled-5 183 11/7/2016 8:37:58 PM\n\f\n184 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nenlightened agricultural policy, the Congress Governments made\nno attempt either to ensure remunerative prices for farmers based\non a scientific assessment of all the input costs or to bring about a\nrational balance between the prices of agricultural and industrial\nproducts. Institutional credit and marketing support for the Indian\nkisan was deliberately kept weak and unreliable. As a result, the\nhardworking Indian kisan was pushed into poverty and the vicious\nclutches of debt. Newspapers have reported about \u2018serial suicides\u2019\nby farmers in Andhra Pradesh. In 1950-51, the ratio between per\ncapita rural and urban income was 1:2. Today, it has become 1:4.\n\nThe BJP believes that the one-fourth urban India cannot have\nbalanced development without the rapid development of the\nthree-fourths rural India. Hence, rural India is not antagonistic,\nbut complementary and supplementary to urban India.\n\nBJP\u2019s Agenda for Reinvigorating Rural India\n\n\u00a2 The BJP attaches the highest priority to ensuring India\u2019s\nfood security and to the crying need to rid India of the\nscourge of hunger. Towards the goal of creating a hunger-\nfree society, our Government shall appeal to Indian kisans\nto double food production by the year 2010 and pledges\nall support for the realization of this objective.\n\n\u00a2 The BJP pledges to reverse the process of economic, social\nand political marginalization of India\u2019s rural population\nand effectively fight the elitist, anti-kisan Congress mindset,\nwhich engendered this process.\n\n\u00a2 The BJP is committed to restore agriculture to its proper\nplace in the national economy and re-establish, before the\nclose of the first decade of the next century, India\u2019s farmers\nas a strong and self-confident community enjoying the\nfruits of prosperity and social justice.\n\n\u00a2 We shall take all the necessary steps to vastly increase\nboth public and private investment in agriculture and\nagro-based industries, with the aim of harnessing its\nfull potential for rural wealth generation and productive\nemployment generation. In this, our priority will be the\nsmall and medium farmers and small-scale industries and\nbusinesses.\n\nUntitled-5 184 11/7/2016 8:37:58 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 185\n\n\u00a2 Transfer of technology and development of appropriate\ntechnology has become a matter of great urgency for the\nrevitalization of the rural economy.

Earmark 60 per cent of Plan funds in the budget for\nagricultural and rural development.\n\n2. Make a quantum increase in Governmental and private\ninvestment in improving the rural infrastructure\nof irrigation, all-weather roads, transport, power,\ntelecommunication and credit and financing facilities.\n\n3. Substantially increase Governmental and private investment\nin strengthening the social infrastructure in rural areas\nin the fields of drinking water, education, health-care,\nsanitation and housing.\n\n4. Through a massive plan of rural housing, the goal of\n\u2018Shelter for All\u2019 will be achieved by the year 2010. At least\nhalf the task will be sought to be achieved in the next five\nyears.\n\n5. Give all possible support to increasing milk production\nand animal husbandry. Priority will be given to setting\nup milk processing and milk product manufacturing units\nclose to the catchment area.\n\n6. To make agriculture sustainable for even the smallest\nfarmer, the following initiatives will be taken:\n\n(a) Remunerative prices for the entire range of agriculture\nproduce by linking them to input costs. Towards this\nend, our Government will constitute an Agriculture\nCosts and Prices Commission. Two-thirds of its\nmembers will be agriculturists and farm experts.\nThe Commission will be an autonomous body and\nits recommendations will be mandatory. It will also\nrecommend ways of achieving a balance between the\nprices of agricultural produce and industrial goods\nand services.\n\n(b) In the interim, support price for farm produce to be\n\n11/7/2016 8:37:58 PM\n\f\n186 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nlinked to the general price index.\n\n(c) To help the farmers through a number of governmental\nand cooperative schemes to reduce per acre production\ncost.\n\n(d) To help the farmers through a number of governmental\nand cooperative schemes to increase per acre farm\nproductivity. Towards this end, attractive incentives\nwill be instituted for those who achieve exceptionally\nhigh standards of productivity.\n\n(e) To reduce the dependence on primary agriculture\nproduction by encouraging profitable ancillary\nactivities.\n\n(f) To begin a nationwide crop and animal husbandry\ninsurance scheme to cover all farmers.\n\n7. Allow free movement of foodgrains throughout the country.\n\n8. Unveil a comprehensive policy for bringing waste and\nbarren land into productive agriculture or agro-forestry\nuse. Private sector companies will be encouraged to invest\nin this activity, provided individual farmers and village\ncooperatives are given substantial share in the equity\nholding.\n\n9. Give anew thrust to social forestry, horticulture, vegetable\ngrowing, floriculture, sericulture, mushroom farming.\n\n10. Encourage inland fisheries, piggeries and bee-keeping.\n\n11. As part of acomprehensive National Agri-business Policy,\nhelp setting up of value-addition chains to link production,\npreservation, transportation, processing, packaging and\nmarketing. This policy envisions the participation of the\nindividual agriculturist not only as a primary producer\nand supplier, but as a shareholder who will benefit from\nprofits generated at every stage of the value chain.\n\n12. Vastly expand the network of warehouses and mandis\n(market yards). Our policy will make it mandatory for\nthe mandis to pay 80 per cent of the price as an interim\npayment at the time of delivery of the farmer\u2019s produce.\n\n13. Delicense the sugar industry and decontrol the price and\nmovement of molasses.\n\n14. Encourage co-generation of power, as also production of\n\nUntitled-5 186 11/7/2016 8:37:58 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 187\n\na wide variety of sugar-based by-products at all the sugar\nmills in India.\n\n15. Continue subsidy on fertilizers.\n\n16. Set up a vast network of easily reachable farmers\u2019 service\ncentres and expand the scope of extension programmes.\n\n17. Make comprehensive documents available to farmers\ngiving land records, ownership and all other relevant\ninformation. Our Government will also promote rapid\ncomputerization of these records.\n\n18. Reform land acquisition laws with the following objectives:\n(a) Farmers should get prompt and full compensation for\nhis land at market rates; (b) Farmers who have to part\nwith their land for industrial or urbanization projects\nshould also be made shareholders in these projects; and\n(c) If any public or private sector agency which acquires\nfarm land for a particular project fails to execute it within\na specified period, the Government will take it back from\nthe promoters.\n\n19. Boost export of agriculture goods, especially processed\ngoods, in a big way. Imports will be kept to the bare\nminimum and that too if warranted by extraordinary\ncircumstances. In both export and import of farm goods,\nthe interests of Indian kisans will be given the highest\nconsideration.\n\n20. Bolster efforts to increase productivity in dryland farming.\n\n21. Re-orient agricultural planning on the basis of agro-\nclimatic zoning of the entire country to fully harness the\nnatural benefits of land fertility and ecosystems for specific\nagricultural produce.\n\nOur Steps to Provide Irrigation Facilities\n\n1. Double the area under irrigation in ten years through\noptimal use of small, medium and large projects. Priority\nwill be given to small and minor irrigation projects with\nlocal investment and management participation.\n\n2. Complete ongoing irrigation projects within a specified\nperiod and launch new projects ona firm, time-bound basis.\n\n3. Encourage the use of alternative sources of irrigation\n\nUntitled-S_ 187 11/7/2016 8:37:59 PM\n\f\n188 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nthrough incentives and better water management.\n\n4. Give attractive incentives for the popularization of drip\nirrigation and sprinkler irrigation systems.\n\n5. Ensure that farmers are made to pay only for the water\nthey consume.\n\n6. Draw up a master plan for flood control and harnessing\nof flood waters for irrigation. Offer prompt compensation\nfor crops lost in floods.\n\n7. Take effective steps to raise the ground water level.\n\nCheck waterlogging, salination and soil erosion.\n\n9. Institute a Regional Water Corporation to plan and increase\nwater supplies.\n\n%\n\nOur Steps to Revive Village Industry\n1. Establish an extensive chain of small-scale, tiny and cottage\nindustry units.\n2. Give the greatest impetus to this sector by provision of\neasy and adequate credit at low interest rates.\n3. Create new marketing opportunities and facilities for rural\nartisans and craftsmen.\nSet up a National Artisan Development Bank.\nSet up special institutes for skill upgradation.\nGive attractive incentives for bio-gas units.\nCreate weekly mandis in towns and cities in which villages\nand artisans can sell their products directly to urban\nconsumers.\n\nND Oe\n\nOur Steps to Provide Power for Agriculture\n\n1. Accelerate total rural electrification so that no village is\nleft without power in the next five years.\n\n2. Ensure adequate and reliable supply of quality power for\nagricultural activity.\n\n3. Set up small power stations and sub-stations in rural areas\nfor supplying power exclusively to villages.\n\n4. The frequent breaking down of transformers and\ndistributors in rural areas causes havoc with agricultural\noperations. SEBs, though, don\u2019t have the money to replace\nthese assets. The Government will encourage farmers\u2019 (and\n\nUntitled-5 188 11/7/2016 8:37:59 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 189\n\nother users) to form cooperatives to install, maintain and\ncharge for these rural electrical equipment. Loans from the\nRural Electrification Corporation will be given for this.\n\nOur Steps to Strengthen the Rural Cooperative Movement\n\n1. To unveil a National Rural Cooperatives Policy which\nwill review the working of the cooperative sector so far,\nsimplify rules and regulations governing the functioning\nof cooperative societies and introduce necessary reforms\nto bring this sector in line with the reforms in the rest of\nthe national economy.\n\n2. The policy will also recommend measures to promote\nthe cooperative movement in States where it is weak and\nailing.\n\n3. Free cooperatives from political and bureaucratic\ninterference.\n\n4. Take effective steps to eliminate corruption and nepotism\nin cooperative bodies.\n\n5. Ensure that rural cooperatives are not only commercially\nviable but also promote equity and social justice.\n\n6. Make entry in passbooks mandatory for all money deposits.\n\n7. Only those entirely dependent on agriculture will be\nallowed to become members of farmers\u2019 cooperative\nsocieties.\n\n8. Ensure free, fair and timely elections to cooperative bodies.\n\n9. Encourage collaboration between the cooperative sector\nand the corporate sector in the areas of marketing,\nmanufacturing, technology transfer, mobilization of\ninvestible resources and exports. All necessary measures\nwill, however, be taken to ensure that the interests of small\nand medium farmers are not only protected but promoted\nby such collaborative ventures.\n\n10. The BJP will enact the long-pending Multi-State Cooperative\nAct.\n\n11. Multiple and often conflicting laws and agencies governing\ncooperative banks and other rural financial institutions\nwill be streamlined.\n\nUntitled-5 189 11/7/2016 8:37:59 PM\n\f\n190 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nOur Steps to Implement Land Reforms\n1. Enforce the implementation of land ceiling laws in all\nStates.\n2. Set up designated courts to quickly deal with all land\nceiling disputes and monitoring enforcement of verdicts.\n3. Expedite distribution of ceiling surplus land among landless\nfarmers.\n4. Monitor the use of the distributed land to prevent its\nalienation from beneficiaries.\n5. Reclaim cultivable land lying fallow.\n. Time-bound registration of all lands.\n7. Decide ownership rights at the level of Gram Panchayats\nwithout any delay.\n\na\n\nOur Steps to Improve Rural Education\n\n1. Re-orient education in villages and rural towns to address\nthe varied needs of agriculture, agro-processing, agri-\nservices, management and other areas of the rural economy.\nAgriculture and related subjects will be specially included\nin the curriculum in rural schools.\n\n2. Give a big boost to technical and vocational education as\nit is crucial to the development of rural human resources.\n\n3. Set up a chain of Krishi Vidyalayas in each block to enrich\nthe knowledge content and expertise of young people who\nare engaged in farming and farm-related activities.\n\n4. Increase facilities for informal farm education, short-\nterm courses, seminars, field trips, etc. for the benefit of\npracticing agriculturists.\n\n5. Give a major boost to rural R&D by strengthening the link\nbetween agricultural universities and top achievers in the\nfarming community.\n\nOur Steps to Ensure Cow Protection\n\nTHE BJP regretfully observes that, despite Article 48 of the\nConstitution, millions of cows and cow progeny are slaughtered\nevery year, most of them for export, thereby causing irreparable\nharm to agriculture and villages. Keeping in view Article 48, the\nBJP will:\n\nUntitled-5_ 190 11/7/2016 8:37:59 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 191\n\n1. Impose a total ban on the slaughter of cows and cow-\nprogeny, including bulls and bullocks and prohibit all\ntrade, including export (state as well as private) in beef.\n\n2. Create a policy that will result in improved cattle breeding.\n\n3. Exempt the income of Goshalas and Pinjrapoles from tax.\n\nThe BJP recognizes the fact that from times immemorial,\n\ncow-protection has remained of the basics of Indian culture and\nIndian agriculture and it is on the patient back of the cow and its\nprogeny that the entire structure of Indian agriculture rests. Over\nseven crore animals are employed in farming operations in Indian\nvillages, more than 80 per cent of the rural transport needs are met\nby the bullock cart. Our livestock is also an effective protection\nagainst environmental degradation.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 191 11/7/2016 8:37:59 PM\n\f\nOur Foreign Policy\n\nProtecting India\u2019s National Interest\n\nTHE end of the Cold War has brought with it hopes of an era of\npeace and harmony. We see many welcome new manifestations in\nour collective attitudes towards resolving longstanding international\nissues of common concern relating to the environment, health,\neconomic development and conflict resolution.\n\nWhile the possibilities are immense, some old habits persist.\nWe see a renewed tendency by some big powers to dominate and\nto impose conditionalities to advance their political and economic\ninterest even if it is detrimental to others. There are also perceived\nnotions of civilizational conflicts as also spurts in conflicts. This\ndemands that India\u2019s national interest must be protected and\npursued more vigorously. Our diplomacy must, therefore, be\nproactive rather than being merely reactive without sacrificing the\nvalues of peace, equality and cooperation.\n\nIn the recent past we have seen a tendency to bend under\npressure. This arises as much out of ignorance of our rightful\nplace and role in world affairs as also from a loss of national self-\nconfidence and resolve. A nation as large and capable as ourselves\nmust make its impact felt on the world arena. A BJP Government\nwill demand a premier position for the country in all global fora.\n\nThe BJP rejects the notion of nuclear apartheid and will actively\noppose attempts to impose a hegemonistic nuclear regime by\nmeans of CTBT, FMCR and MTCR. We will not be dictated to by\nanybody in matters of security requirements and in the exercise of\nthe nuclear option. We will pursue our national goals and principles\nsteadfastly. Briefly these are:\n\n1. To give India a role and position in world affairs\n\nUntitled-5 192 11/7/2016 8:37:59 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 193\n\ncommensurate with its size and capability;\n\n2. To promote sovereign equality among nations. The BJP\nrejects all forms of political and economic hegemonism\nand is committed to actively resisting such efforts;\n\n3. To vigorously pursue endeavors for India to become a\npermanent member of the United Nations Security Council.\nWe believe that the existing arrangements in the UN are\ntilted in the favor of certain countries to serve their narrow\ninterest. We are committed to the reform of the UN;\n\n4. To re-orient Indian diplomacy to our economic and\ncommercial goals and to ensure that our missions abroad\nplay a more active and supportive role in meeting these;\n\n5. To ensure greater coordination between the ministries\nand agencies responsible for external affairs, defence,\nfinance, international trade and our external and internal\nintelligence;\n\n6. To promote greater regional and civilizational relationship\nand strive for Asian solidarity in general and the\ndevelopment of the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation in particular. Integral to this would be\nrenewed efforts to improve bilateral relationships with all\nneighboring countries without any third party mediation\nor interference;\n\n7. To have greater interaction with more African nations\nand to build ties with our traditional friends like Kenya,\nNigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe;\n\n8. To place relations with the USA on a more even based on\nmutual respect, shared values and congruence of interests.\nWe expect the United States to be more sensitive to India\u2019s\nsecurity and economic interests;\n\n9. To further develop the long and traditional relationship\nwith Russia by increased cooperation in trade, technology,\ndefence and other security related areas. India and Russia\nhave many common interests in Asia and we will strive\nfor greater cooperation to serve them;\n\n10. To strengthen political and economic relations with the\nEuropean Unions, ASEAN countries, Japan, South Korea,\nSouth Africa, Iran, the Arab nations, Israel, Central Asian\n\nUntitled-5 193 11/7/2016 8:37:59 PM\n\f\n194 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nrepublics and fellow Commonwealth nations;\n\n11. To take active steps to persuade Pakistan to abandon its\npresent policy of hostile interference in our internal affairs\nby supporting insurgent and terrorist groups. The BJP\naffirms unequivocally India\u2019s sovereignty over the whole\nof Jammu and Kashmir, including the areas under foreign\noccupations;\n\n12. To improve relations with China by seeking speedy\nresolution of the outstanding border problem. Even\nwhile doing so we will seek greater cross-border trade\nand cooperation in other areas. We are also concerned\nabout China continuing transfer of advanced weapons\nand technologies to Pakistan as this has a vital bearing\non our ties with China;\n\n13. To support a united Sri Lanka within which the\nlegitimate aspirations of the Tamil people should be fully\naccommodated. The BJP greatly regrets the continuing\nbloodshed particularly since the Indian people have long\nstanding, traditional and fraternal ties with the Sri Lankan\npeople;\n\n14. To maintain the unique, warm and friendly relations with\nNepal with which India has the closest cultural, religious\nand historical ties. We will seek to widen existing areas\nof cooperation and also develop new avenues of fruitful\ncooperation. We recognize in particular the great scope\nfor increasing cooperation in the energy and environment\nrelated areas. A BJP Government will seek to resolve all\noutstanding issues quickly;\n\n15. To further improve relationship with Myanmar with India\nhas a long border and age-old cultural, religious and\nhistorical ties. There is much scope for greater cooperation\nin the fields of defence, security, economy and culture;\n\n16. To further consolidate the close and friendly ties between\nIndia and Bhutan;\n\n17. To reinforce the improving relations with Bangladesh.\nWe however continue to view with concern the unabated\nillegal infiltration into India from that country and will\nseek the active participation of the Bangladesh authorities\n\nUntitled-5 194 11/7/2016 8:37:59 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 195\n\nin curbing this; and,\n\n18. To take an active role in seeking an early and peaceful\nresolutions of the internecine Afghan conflict particularly\nsince its continuance has adverse security implications\nfor India and the development of trade and economic\ncooperation with countries in the region.\n\nThe BJP re-affirms its commitment to peace amongst all\nnations; to the prosperity of the peoples of the world; and to an\nenhanced role for India in world affairs as befits this great and\nancient civilization.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 195 11/7/2016 8:38:00 PM\n\f\nOur Nation\u2019s Security\nSuraksha for Country and Citizens\n\nTHE nation faces grave challenges to its integrity and security as\nnever before. The internal and external security environment has\ndeteriorated sharply in the last decade. The previous Governments\nhave been found wanting in their efforts and determination to face\nthese threats and are responsible for this. Since 1991, the country\u2019s\ndefence budget has been declining in real terms. They have declined\nfrom 3.4 per cent of the GDP in 1989-90 to a mere 2.2 per cent this\nyear. Successive weak and irresolute Governments have imperiled\nnational security. There is a mistaken view that there is a conflict\nbetween national security and economic development. But these\ntwo go hand-in-hand. There cannot be economic development\nwithout commensurate security preparation and the reverse, too,\nis equally true.\n\nThe dimensions and directions of present and future threats\nneed to be constantly analyzed and evaluated. In the glaring absence\nof governmental interest and inter-ministerial coordination, the\nmechanisms for this have fallen into disuse. The armed forces have\nbeen ignored in defence policy planning. Misguided bureaucratic\ninterference has demoralized the higher echelons of the armed\nforces and has also had a telling effect on defence preparedness.\nThe BJP Government will take immediate steps to reverse such\nnegative trends and establish coordination between the armed\nforces and the Government at all levels.\n\nThe BJP notes with concern the inadequate pace of defence\nresearch and development despite abundant talent available in\nDRDO. Inadequate budgetary support is a major reason for this.\nThe inordinate delays in the LCA, nuclear submarine and guided\n\nUntitled-5 196 11/7/2016 8:38:00 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 197\n\nmissiles, and other programmes are matters of particular concern.\nOur scientists and technologists are second to none and it is lack of\npolitical will and clarity on strategic issues that is the main cause of\nthe delay. Defence production performance, too, has not been up to\nthe mark. The performance of defence production units need to be\nmonitored more closely and brought up to acceptable commercial\nand international standards.\n\nA National Commission will study and analyze the trends in\ndefence technologies and appropriately advise the Government on\nthe development and induction of advanced weapons.\n\nExternal Security\n\nTHE frenetic pace of military expansion and modernization\nby some of our neighbors and the growing pressure and power of\nforeign navies in the Indian Ocean compel us to take the state of\nour defence preparedness very seriously. We also cannot remain\noblivious to the new developments in weapon technology and\nthe induction of very advanced conventional weapons systems\nin the region by some power. These must be neutralized. We are,\ntherefore, committed to:\n\n1. Establish a National Security Council to constantly analyze\nsecurity, political and economic threats and render\ncontinuous advice to the Government. This Council will\nundertake India\u2019s first-ever Strategic Defence Review to\nstudy and analyze the security environment and make\nappropriate recommendations to cover all aspects of\ndefence requirements and organization;\n\n2. Re-evaluate the country\u2019s nuclear policy and exercise the\noption to induct nuclear weapons;\n\n3. Expedite the development of the Agni series of ballistic\nmissiles with a view to increasing their range and accuracy;\n\n4. Increase the radius of power projection by inducting\nappropriate force multipliers such as battlefield surveillance\nsystems and air-to-air refueling;\n\n5. Enhance the traditional and technical capabilities of our\nexternal intelligence agencies and also to increase the\ninteraction and co-ordination with user departments; and,\n\n6. Place para-military forces in sensitive border areas under\n\nUntitled-5 197 11/7/2016 8:38:00 PM\n\f\n198 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\nthe full control of the Indian Army.\n\nJai Jawan\n\nTHE country is justly proud of its soldiers who constantly\nbrave the elements, endure extreme hardships and risk their lives\nto defend the nation. Service in the armed forces must be made\nattractive for young people and must be considered a honour.\nConsequently:\n\n1. The BJP Government will take measures to make\nemployment in the armed forces more rewarding and\nsecure for soldiers greater respect of society;\n\n2. The BJP Government will suitably improve living and\nservice conditions and expeditiously rectify existing\nanomalies;\n\n3. The BJP Government will recognize the services and\nsacrifices of retired personnel and attend to their problems\nimmediately;\n\n4. The BJP Government will increase the benefits and\ncompensation to widows and dependents of service\npersonnel who die in action;\n\n5. The BJP Government will be committed to increasing\navenues of lateral induction into other security forces and\nother Government departments/undertakings/agencies\nfor retired officers and jawans; and,\n\n6. The BJP Government will appoint a committee to examine\nthe question of retirement age at different levels in the\narmed forces and make appropriate recommendation to\nthis effect.\n\nInternal Security\n\nTHE BJP will give utmost attention to security-sensitive areas\nin the North, the North-East and the South. The BJP Government\nwill review the role and performance of the police organizations\nand take urgent steps to revitalize them. We recognize the need\nfor the permanent cadre officers in CPO\u2019s to have greater avenues\nfor advancement.\n\nThe BJP Government will ensure far greater co-ordination\nbetween the armed forces, police organizations and the administration\n\nUntitled-5 198 11/7/2016 8:38:00 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 199\n\nin areas beset with insurgency and terrorism. Armed insurgents\nand foreign mercenaries will be eliminated. Our security forces will\nbe given a free hand to deal with armed insurgency and terrorism.\n\nThe BJP Government will revamp the intelligence agencies to\nenhance their effectiveness and ensure greater coordination with\nsecurity and police forces.\n\nCentral and State Police Forces will be reorganized and\nmodernized while simultaneously improving working and living\nconditions of their personnel.\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\nWE welcome the restoration of an elected Government in\nthe State. The BJP Government will take suitable measures for\nestablishing a durable peace in the State to promote progress\nand prosperity. Repeated massacres of Hindus in Kashmir show\nthat unless the State Government takes the business of curbing\nmilitancy seriously, a durable peace will be hard to achieve. The\nBJP Government will strive for a more structured coordination\nbetween the Central forces and the State Government.\n\nNorth-East\n\nTHE conditions in the North-Eastern States continue to be\ndisturbed. The situation in Assam in particular has worsened in\nthe last few years. It is the Congress Party\u2019s manipulative and\ncorrupt politics that have contributed most to this. Poor governance,\ncorrupt and callous administration, the flow of narcotics and foreign\ninterference have together contributed to the rapid deterioration of\nthe law and order situation. The unchecked and unabated illegal\ninfiltration from Bangladesh has been the single largest causative\nfactor in destabilizing the region. The spread of heroin addiction\nand HIV infection in some States is cause for utmost concern.\n\nThe BJP will give socio-economic problems of this region\nhigh priority as lack of development has helped anti-national and\nseparatist elements in their attempt to foment disaffection. We\nbelieve development is one of the effective antidotes against such\nattempts.\n\nThe distance between this region and Delhi has further\nheightened their sense of alienation. Nothing has been done in\n\nUntitled-5 199 11/7/2016 8:38:00 PM\n\f\n200 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nthe past 50 years to bridge this physical and emotional distance.\nThe BJP commits itself to forging new and strong economic and\nemotional bonds between the North-East and the rest of India.\n\nTherefore, we propose to do the following in the North-East:\n\n1. Draw up and implement a comprehensive development\nprogramme, focusing on basic communications\ninfrastructure like roads, railways, bridges and air link;\n\n2. Harness the immense hydro-electric potential in the region\nboth for rapid development of these States as well as for\naugmenting the power supply of eastern States, thus\nenabling the North-East region to mobilise additional\nresources;\n\n3. Put into place effective checks and balances to prevent\nseepage of development funds which should reach the\npeople of the region and not be pocketed by a corrupt\nfew.\n\n4. Strengthen the North-Eastern Council to effectively oversee\nand speed up the social and economic development of the\nregion.\n\n5. The security apparatus will be strengthened to check\ninfiltration, stem the flow of narcotics and weapons and\neliminate insurgents;\n\n6. Provide all citizens in the region with identity cards;\n\n7. It will strengthen the North-Eastern Council to effectively\noversee and speed up the social and economic development\nof the region;\n\n8. Repeal the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunal\nAct (IMDTA) and strengthen existing immigration laws\nand rules; and,\n\n9. Enact new laws and rules to make illegal infiltration\ndifficult and deny the extension of benefits of citizenship\nto such entrants.\n\nIllegal Infiltration\n\nTHE Congress and United Front Governments for their own\nnarrow and selfish reasons have been deliberately negligent of this\nproblem. The total number of illegal infiltrators from Bangladesh\nis officially ascertained at over 1.7 crore. The adverse impact of\n\nUntitled-5 200 11/7/2016 8:38:01 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 201\n\nthis on our economy and social and political order poses problems\nof grave magnitude. This cannot be allowed to continue. Our\nGovernment will:\n\n1. Take more stringent measures to intercept illegal infiltrators\nand turn them back. Fencing of the border wherever\npossible will be urgently taken up. Border patrolling will\nbe intensified;\n\n2. Initiate steps to detect illegal infiltrators and delete their\nnames from electoral rolls; and,\n\n3. Maintain a national register of citizens.\n\nThe BJP has the vision and the political will to transform India\ninto a prosperous and powerful nation in the initial decades of the\nnext century. A strong and secure India is an essential requisite\nfor this.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 201 11/7/2016 8:38:01 PM\n\f\nOur Social Philosophy\n\nRooted in Integral Humanism\n\nTHE Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s social agenda flows from\nits ideology of Integral Humanism. Our ideology rules out\ncontradictions between society and its very components, as also\nbetween society and the individual. Our concern for the last man in\nthe last row is as deep as that for the first man in the first row, if not\nmore. The BJP\u2019s concept of social justice, therefore, does not seek to\ncreate rifts and schisms between various sections of society, but aims\nat removing social and economic disparities that have resulted in\ndenial of a share in power, impoverishment and erosion of human\ndignity. An ideal society is not one that is compartmentalized in\nsegments, but is an integral whole, harmonious and conflict-free.\nHence, we subscribe to Samajik Samarasata (social harmony) and\nSamajik Nyaya (social justice) and strive to avoid social strife.\n\nEqual Rights for all in Satta (power), Sampatti (prosperity) and\nSamman (dignity)\n\n1. The BJP will actively promote a casteless socio-economic\norder that will effectively provide access to equal\nopportunity for all citizens, irrespective of their caste,\ncreed, religion and gender.\n\n2. The BJP will, if necessary through legislation, dismantle\npractices, customs, beliefs, usages and institutions, which\nin any manner hurt the dignity of an individual.\n\n3. The BJP will ensure that the place of an individual in\nsociety is not determined on the basis of his/her birth.\n\nUntitled-5 202 11/7/2016 8:38:01 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 203\n\nUntouchability: A Crime Against Humanity\n\n1. The BJP will remove the last vestiges of untouchability,\nwhich we believe is an unpardonable crime against\nhumanity.\n\n2. The BJP will strive to inculcate an ethos of equality in\nsocial and inter-personal relationships.\n\n3. A befitting National Memorial in honour of Dr. Babasaheb\nAmbedkar, who dedicated his life to the cause of social\njustice, will be erected at Chaityabhoomi in Mumbai on\nthe lines of national memorials like Raj Ghat, Shanti Van\nand Vijay Ghat.\n\nOur Commitment to the Welfare of Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes\n\nNEARLY four-and-a-half decades of Congress rule and the\nrecent UF regime have failed to empower the Scheduled Castes\nand the Scheduled Tribes. While thousands of crores have been\nspent, ostensibly for their welfare, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes face increasing impoverishment and marginalization. Eighty\nper cent of members belonging to these sections of Indian society\nhave been pushed below the poverty line. The BJP is committed to\nthe social, economic and political empowerment of the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes, so that the wrongs of the past are\ncorrected in a time-bound manner for a better future. To fulfill\nour commitment, we will be guided by a policy whose highlights\nare as follows:\n\n1. Existing institutions and Constitutional safeguards\nfor Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes will be\nstrengthened and made operationally more effective.\n\n2. The provision of special facilities and preferential\nopportunities, including reservations, will be implemented\nina manner so as to benefit the broadest cross-section and\nlargest number of SCs and STs.\n\n3. The reservations policy will be backed up with a statute\nand all backlogs will be cleared within a specified time-\nframe. Special tribunals will be set up under CAT to\nexpeditiously deal with complaints of non-implementation\nof the reservations policy and related grievances.\n\nUntitled-5 203 11/7/2016 8:38:01 PM\n\f\n204 * 1998 Manifesto\n\n4. All cases of atrocities against members of the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes will be promptly inquired\ninto and the guilty punished through special courts.\n\n5. Acomprehensive development package will be introduced\nfor the economic empowerment of Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes. The highlights of this package will\ninclude:\n\n(a) Setting up of a credit agency on the lines of NABARD\nto meet individual and institutional credit needs;\n\n(b) Vocational training, skill upgradation and financial\nassistance to encourage greater participation in\ncottage and rural industries and other means of self-\nemployment;\n\n(c) Food-for-education schemes to raise literacy levels;\n\n(d) A comprehensive national programme of minor\nirrigation facilities for irrigable land held by SCs and\nSTs;\n\n(e) Endowing every landless rural family of the SCs and\nSTs with land and ensuring sustenance level of income\nthrough requisite facilities;\n\n(f) Amending the existing forest policy to provide Vanvasis\ntheir rightful share of minor forest produce;\n\n(g) Processing claims of Vanvasis and Girijans for pattas\nin forest and hill areas promptly; and,\n\n(h) Separate development plans for tribals living in the\nplains.\n\n6. The specified allocation for the Special Component Plan\n(17 per cent) for Scheduled Castes and the Tribal Sub-\nPlan (8 per cent) for Scheduled Tribes within the total\nPlan allocation will be strictly followed both at the Centre\nand in the States. Every effort will be made to ensure that\nallocated funds do not lapse and are spent as per Plan\nprovisions.\n\n7. The pernicious practice of carrying night soil will\nbe eliminated and all those engaged in scavenging\nrehabilitated.\n\n8. Allotment of pattas for land, home site and homes in the\nnames of wives/widows/ daughters. These will be properly\n\nUntitled-5 204 11/7/2016 8:38:01 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 205\n\ndrawn up and handed over to actual beneficiaries;\n\n9. Unifying the Banjaras under a common category and\nensuring that they are benefited by the Minimum Needs\nProgramme;\n\n10. Necessary steps to stop the exploitation of tribals by\ncontractors and to free them from indebtedness. We will\nconsider enacting a law whereby the outstanding debts\nof those tribals who have paid back the principal amount\nand 50 per cent of the capital as interest, will be written\noff;\n\n11. Stringent action to prevent tribal land alienation through\nconversion of tribal land for industrial and other purposes;\n\n12. A National Policy for the \u2018total rehabilitation\u2019 of families\ndisplaced by development projects. The policy will include\nsocial, economic, educational, environmental, occupational\nand cultural aspects;\n\n13. An engineering and a medical college will be set up\nin the national capital in honour of Maharishi Valmiki\nand Babasaheb Ambedkar. Fifty per cent seats in these\ninstitutions will be reserved for students from Scheduled\nCastes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs;\n\n14. Panchayat institutions in scheduled areas and tribal areas\nwill be made effective and functional in the light of Bhuria\nCommittee\u2019s recommendations;\n\n15. Claims for inclusion into the ST list by erstwhile \u2018criminal\u2019\ntribes and others will be entrusted to a commission for\nrecommendations.\n\nOur Commitment to the Welfare of Socially and Educationally\nBackward Classes\nTHE BJP is committed to ensuring social and economic justice\nto the Other Backward Classes. This is integral to our concept of\nSocial Harmony (Samajik Samarasata). We reject the divisive and\ncasteist politics of our adversaries that have neither economically\nempowered the bulk of the OBCs nor reduced their educational\nbackwardness. We propose to:\n1. Continue with the current reservations policy for the Other\nBackward Classes till they are socially and educationally\n\nUntitled-5 205 11/7/2016 8:38:01 PM\n\f\n206 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nintegrated with the rest of society;\n\n2. Provide training, financial support and management\nfacilities for upgradation of skills in traditional industries\nand professions of OBCs;\n\n3. Take corrective and remedial measures in view of recent\nmacro-economic policy decisions that have rendered\nseveral sections of people belonging to the OBCs jobless;\nand,\n\n4. Make the National Backward Classes Finance Development\nCorporation fully operational.\n\nOur Commitment to Minorities: Towards Equal Opportunity\nand Prosperity\n\nTHE BJP\u2019s concept of Positive Secularism is: Justice for All,\nAppeasement of None. In the name of \u2018secularism\u2019, the Congress and\nthe United Front parties have shamelessly pandered to communalism\nand indulged in \u2018vote-bank politics\u2019. As a result, members of the\nminority communities have been reduced to nothing more than\nnumbers to be played with at the time of elections. While these\nparties have gained, the minorities have lost \u2014as also has India. The\nminorities have been cynically used for the purpose of garnering\nvotes these past 50 years, but their socio-economic problems have\nremained unattended. The true meaning of \u2018secularism\u2019, equal\nrespect for all faith\u2014sarva panth samadar\u2014has been perverted by\nthe pseudo-secularists into appeasement of regressive elements.\n\nThe coming election provides a window of opportunity to\nthe minorities to take a fresh look at the options that are available\nto them. They should not go blindly with the so-called \u2018secular\u2019\nparties that have done nothing to solve their real socio-economic\nproblems. Instead, they should make a clean break with the past\nand support the BJP. The patron-client relationship advocated\nby others is different from what we offer\u2014equal rights, equal\nopportunities, equal privileges and equal responsibilities. Above all,\nwe have proved in the States where the BJP is in power that we can\nmaintain communal peace and harmony; we can ensure security of\nlife and property; and, we can protect the honour and dignity of the\nminority communities. In keeping with this commitment, we will:\n\n1. Provide all minority communities with equal opportunities\n\nUntitled-5 206 11/7/2016 8:38:02 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 207\n\nfor prosperity;\n\n2. Encourage access to education which is the key to social\nand economic progress;\n\n3. Give all incentives to artisans, especially those involved\nin traditional arts and crafts;\n\n4. Initiate special self-employment schemes and the requisite\ntraining programmes;\n\n5. Launch community programmes for raising the level\nof awareness among women members of the minority\ncommunities and providing them with education;\n\n6. Amend Article 30 of the Constitution suitably to remove any\nscope of discrimination against any religious community\nin matters of education;\n\n7. Entrust the responsibilities of the Minorities Commission\nto the Human Rights Commission, thus providing greater\nprotection to members of minority communities;\n\n8. Set up special courts to try cases of communal violence\nand, if necessary, amend existing laws to provide for\nexemplary punishment to those inciting or taking part in\ncommunal or sectarian violence. The BJP\u2019s commitment\nis to create a riot-free India;\n\n9. Protect wakf properties from being usurped by unscrupulous\nindividuals and help wakf boards to develop these\nproperties for the welfare of poor Muslim families; and,\n\n10. Ban job advertisements which require applicants to declare\ntheir religion.\n\nOur Commitment to Kashmiri Pandits\n\nSEPARATIST and sectarian militancy in Jammu and Kashmir\nduring the late \u201c80s and right up to the mid \u201990s resulted in mass\nmigration from the Valley and other areas in Kashmir. More than\n300,000 people, including 250,000 Kashmiri Pandits and Pandits,\nand Punjabi and Dogra Hindus, apart from Muslims, were forced\nto flee their home and hearth in the Valley by terrorists and\nfundamentalists. The BJP promises immediate action to help those\ndisplaced from the Kashmir Valley and other parts of the State.\nTowards this end, we propose to:\n\n1. Work with the Jammu and Kashmir Government to evolve\n\nUntitled-5 207 11/7/2016 8:38:02 PM\n\f\n208 * 1998 Manifesto\n\na feasible scheme for the phased return of the displaced\npeople, especially the Pandits, to their ancient land;\n\n2. Provide all assistance to the Jammu and Kashmir\nGovernment in order to ensure that the displaced people\nreceive adequate financial assistance, health care, housing,\neducation and employment facilities till such time they\nare able to return to their land;\n\n3. Evolve a rehabilitation package, including adequate\nassistance to rebuild houses that have been destroyed,\nthat will be an incentive for returning to the Valley; and,\n\n4. Ensure that their security is inno way imperiled after they\nhave returned to the land from which they were forced\nout against their will.\n\nOur Commitment to Human Rights\n\nTHE BJP believes that upholding human dignity, ensuring\njustice for all and protecting citizens from the tyranny of the State\nare integral to India\u2019s ancient traditions and together form the\ncornerstone of civil society. A just State is one that is kind but also\nfirm in dealing with those who seek to undermine the foundations\nof a civil society. We will:\n\n1. Make the National Human Rights Commission a more\neffective body by providing it with more powers, additional\nresources and better infrastructural support;\n\n2. Publicize the findings of the National Human Rights\nCommission and take action against those found guilty\non the basis of irrefutable evidence;\n\n3. Inculcate among security forces a greater appreciation of\nthe need to safeguard innocent citizens from being harassed\nin insurgency-affected areas; and,\n\n4. Include the study of human, civil and democratic rights\nin school and college curriculum.\n\n5. Prevent foreign interference in the internal affairs of our\ncountry under the guise of monitoring human rights\nviolations.\n\nNon-Resident Indians\n\nTHE BJP believes that Mother India has a special responsibility\n\ntowards her children abroad. We will depart from the current\n\nUntitled-5 208 11/7/2016 8:38:02 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 209\n\npolicy of disinterest and disregard for Non-Resident Indians\nand actively pursue a policy that will nourish the umbilical link\nbetween all people of Indian origin, wherever they may be, with\ntheir motherland. We propose to:\n\n1. Create conditions conducive to the return of talented\nNon-Resident Indians so that they can fulfill their desire\nto serve their motherland;\n\n2. Strengthen the economic, social, cultural, emotional and\nspiritual links between Mother India and her children\nabroad;\n\n3. Re-examine difficulties in granting dual citizenship to\nNon-Resident Indians;\n\n4. Mobilize Non-Resident Indians to effectively lobby India\u2019s\ncase with the Governments and business establishments of\ntheir host country as well as in international fora. In this\ncontext, it would be instructive to study the role of Jews\nand Chinese in the USA in mobilizing opinion favorable\nto their countries;\n\n5. Encourage Indians living abroad to project their national\nidentity even while retaining their respective regional and\nlinguistic identities;\n\n6. Introduce fresh incentives for Non-Resident Indians to\ninvest in their motherland, like China has done with the\nChinese people living abroad;\n\n7. Play an active role in ensuring job and social security for\nNon-Resident Indians working in the Gulf and South-\nEast Asian countries with special emphasis on preventing\nexploitation and providing legal assistance; and,\n\n8. Revitalize the ties between Mother India and people o\nIndian origin living in countries like Guyana, West Indies,\nFiji, Mauritius and South Africa.\n\n \n\noO\n\nUntitled-5_ 209 11/7/2016 8:38:02 PM\n\f\nNari Shakti\n\nEmpowerment of Women\n\nTHE BJP believes that true human development cannot take place\nwithout the empowerment of women. It is not enough to talk about\nremoving discrimination against women and establishing gender\nequality. We need to create new mechanisms for the social, political\nand economic advancement of women as also to generate social\nawareness on gender issues. One such mechanism is empowerment,\nincluding empowerment through enactment of laws. Yet another\nmechanism is capacity-building through education and skill\nacquisition. The BJP pledges itself to legal and policy level initiatives\nto remove discrimination against women and to ensure that their\nrights and dignity are not trampled upon. Special emphasis will\nbe laid on the rights of the girl child. To harness the full potential\nof Nari Shakti, the BJP will:\n\n1. Provide free education to women up to graduation, including\nprofessional studies like medicine and engineering;\n\n2. Immediately seek the passage of the Bill reserving 33 per\ncent seats for women in all elected bodies, including the\nLok Sabha and State Assemblies;\n\n3. Actively promote the legal and economic rights of women\nwhich must be equal to those of men and not subject to\nthe debilitating clauses of personal laws;\n\n4. Entrust the Law Commission to formulate a Uniform Civil\nCode based on the progressive practices from all traditions.\nThis Code will:\n\n(a) Give women property rights;\n(b) Ensure women\u2019s right to adopt;\n(c) Guarantee women equal guardianship rights;\n\nUntitled-5 210 11/7/2016 8:38:02 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 211\n\n(d) Remove discriminatory clauses in divorce laws;\n(e) Put an end to polygamy;\n(f) Make registration of all marriages mandatory.\n\n5. Create conditions in society and workplace to ensure equal\nopportunities in matters of employment and promotion;\n\n6. Enact and enforce an anti-sexual harassment code;\n\n7. Enforce the principle of equal wages for equal work, both\nin the organized as well as unorganized sector;\n\n8. Encourage the introduction of part-time and take-home\njob schemes for working mothers;\n\n9. Promote a health-care system, especially in rural areas,\nthat will focus on the non-reproductive health needs of\nwomen;\n\n10. Provide assistance to single and working mothers and\nintroduce a forward-looking housing policy for their\nbenefit;\n\n11. Work with State Governments to establish adequate number\nof working women\u2019s hostels and short-stay homes for\ndestitute women;\n\n12. Make women partners in the management of community\nassets and properties in rural areas;\n\n13. Enroll the help of panchayats to set up latrines for women\nin rural areas;\n\n14. Expand the scope of the existing micro-credit system\nthrough an enlarged corpus to which both the Union and\nState Governments, apart from banks, will make liberal\ncontributions;\n\n15. Encourage the setting up of cooperative societies in rural\nand urban areas to be managed by women for the benefit\nof women entrepreneurs;\n\n16. Introduce skill-based training programmes and self-\nemployment schemes which are area-specific and job-\nspecific;\n\n17. Design special functional literacy programmes for women\nwho have been denied access to education;\n\n18. Amend laws that deal with molestation, rape and dowry,\nto provide for in-camera trial, swift justice and tough\ndeterrent punishment as well as rehabilitation of the\n\nUntitled-5 211 11/7/2016 8:38:03 PM\n\f\n212 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nvictims of these crimes;\n\n19. Amend the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act to make\nclients as culpable as commercial sex-workers;\n\n20. Strictly enforce age of consent laws and launch a vigorous\ncampaign against child prostitution by making it a\ncognizable offense;\n\n21. Establish family courts in residential areas for speedy\ndisposal of family dispute;\n\n22. Mention of mother\u2019s name will be made mandatory on all\nofficial documents, starting from a child\u2019s birth certificate\nto a person\u2019s death certificate;\n\n23. Set up special courts in every district for the expeditious\ntrial of all civil and criminal cases in which women are\nthe accused;\n\n24. Rapidly induct more women in the police force and appoint\nwomen to senior positions as well as increase the number\nof \u2018Crimes Against Women Cells\u2019 so that no police station\narea is left uncovered by the year 2003;\n\n25. Enact and strictly implement a special law to deal with\ndomestic violence against women;\n\n26. Promote a social agenda designed to discourage negative\ninfluences and end discrimination against the girl child\nin any form;\n\n27. Strictly enforce the existing laws that prohibit unethical\npractices like pre-natal sex-determination tests, female\nfoeticide and infanticide;\n\n28. Invest in the girl child\u2019s health, nutrition and education,\nfrom infancy through adolescence, by formulating\nappropriate programmes and incentive schemes;\n\n29. Universalize primary and secondary education to narrow\nthe gender gap;\n\n30. Prevent media\u2019s projection of women in any manner that\ndemeans them or hurts their dignity; and,\n\n31. Set up a national-level apex women\u2019s development bank\non the lines of NABARD and SIDBI. There is need for\nsetting up a dedicated development bank to cater to the\nfinancing needs of women entrepreneurs and the vast\nnumber of self-employed women.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 212 11/7/2016 8:38:03 PM\n\f\nOur Population Policy\n\nMaking it a People\u2019s Movement\n\nTHE BJP views India\u2019s runaway population growth with all the\nconcern it deserves. Expected to hit the one billion mark by the\nyear 2001, India\u2019s population is set to overtake that of China\nunless the growth rate is checked and then reversed. The danger\nof a runaway population growth is there for all to see: A rapidly\nexpanding population means a slower rate at which development\ncan be effected. While India was one of the first countries in the\nworld to recognize the need to control the growth of its population\nin order to ensure a better distribution of the fruits of development,\nsuccessive Union Governments have failed in the implementation\nof this important programme. Excesses during the Emergency have\ngiven way to complacence and dangerous negligence. The BJP will\nput population-related issues, including family planning, firmly\nback on the national agenda. The BJP believes that the country\u2019s\nrunaway population growth can be arrested and rolled back\nthrough increased awareness, facilitating access to family planning\nmeasures, persuasive Government policies and rapid development.\nIt is an universally acknowledged fact that \u2018development is the best\ncontraceptive.\u2019 But we realize that Government alone cannot fulfill\nthis gigantic task. The Government's efforts must be supplemented\nby a vigorous people\u2019s movement. In addition, the BJP proposes to:\n1. Formulate a National Population Policy by acting on the\nreports of the National Development Council and the\nSwaminathan Committee. This Policy will seek to bring\nthe population growth close to stabilization by the year\n\n2010;\n2. Provide incentives to those who opt for the \u2018two-child\u2019\n\nUntitled-5 213 11/7/2016 8:38:03 PM\n\f\n214 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\nnorm and high incentives to those who embrace the \u2018single-\nchild\u2019 norm;\n\n3. Take all measures for reducing infant mortality rates and\nimproving child health;\n\n4. Promote women\u2019s education, employment and\nempowerment since these can be effective means of\npopulation control as they will allow women a decisive\nrole in regard to their reproductive health and family\nplanning;\n\n5. Introduce disincentives which will apply to all sections of\nsociety in order to discourage large, unsustainable families;\n\n6. Ensure universal access to family planning information\nand quality contraceptive facilities by involving non-\ngovernment organizations and promote awareness\namong the people, especially women, through counseling,\neducational programmes and widest use of modern\nmultimedia capabilities;\n\n7. Introduce family planning methods and facilities that will\nallow women greater freedom of choice without imperiling\ntheir health as well as support research relating to these\nmethods;\n\n8. Encourage women to seek reproductive health services\nas well as launch a special campaign to educate local\ncommunities about negative practices;\n\n9. Offer a special incentive in the form of a fixed deposit that\nwill mature in 21 years for those couples who have only a\ngirl child or those who adopt a girl child under a \u2018Dattak\nPutri Yojana\u2019;\n\n10. Make family planning an integral part of our development\npolicies to ensure widest applicability of these incentives\nand disincentives and provide motivation for a smal\nfamily norm; and,\n\n11. Ensure that the legal age of marriage is strictly implemented.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 214 11/7/2016 8:38:03 PM\n\f\nOur Policy for India\u2019s Youth\nYuva Shakti for Rashtra Shakti\n\nOUR youth are the strength of the family, village, locality and\nthe community. They are also the biceps or triceps of the nation.\nThey are the most idealistic, inspired and energetic section of\nour nation. But in the absence of a driving national vision and a\ncredible national leadership, their energy has remained dormant or\ngot misdirected. Today, the youth of India see the BJP with great\nhope and we see them with equally great hope as the inheritors of\nIndia in the 21st century.\n\nThe BJP recognizes their immense creative potential to effect\npositive social, cultural and political changes. We pledge to create\na conducive environment and a supportive policy framework for\nthe full realization of this potential.\n\nTowards this end, we will unveil a National Youth Policy,\nfor the implementation of which our Government will set aside\nsubstantial budgetary resources. A permanent National Youth\nCommission will be set up to monitor the implementation.\n\nPromotion of a Robust Sports and Physical Culture\n\nSPORTS has been neglected since Independence and the\nblame must be shared by both the Government and society. Also\nneglected is the development of a hardy physical culture, which\nalone provides the necessary basis on which a nation can promote\nexcellence in sports. It is a national shame that India, the second\nmost populous country in the world, almost never finds a place in\nthe medals tally in the Olympic Games. It is a sad commentary on\nour sports culture that, in a country of nearly one billion people,\nwe have not more than 2,000 top-ranking sportsmen and women.\n\nUntitled-5 215 11/7/2016 8:38:03 PM\n\f\n216 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nTo promote Indian sports to attain international recognition and\nto develop a sports ethos in India, the BJP will:\n\n1. Make physical education and sports coaching compulsory\nup to the +2 stage.\n\n2. Make a substantial budgetary allocation for instituting\nmethods to identify and train sports talent.\n\n3. Look for sports talent outside the educational institutions,\nparticularly in villages and in coastal areas.\n\n4. Promote traditional Indian sports and, in association with\nneighboring countries, make them international sports.\n\n5. The functioning of sports bodies will be immediately freed\nfrom all bureaucratic and political interference.\n\n6. A yearly Rural Sports Meet and (depending on the\nconcentration of tribal population) a Tribal Sports Meet\nwill be held in each village, taluka, district and State.\n\n7. With regard to India\u2019s participation in the Olympics and\nother international games, a well-conceived, long-term\npolicy will be evolved to achieve success.\n\nBharat Punarnirman Vahini\n\nTHE BJP Government will unveil a nationwide scheme to tap\nthe spirit of voluntary service among the youth and channel it for\nthe realization of twin goals: Self-growth and Nation-building. The\nscheme envisages the setting up of a Bharat Punarnirman Vahini,\nwhose youthful voluntary members will devote one year of their\nlife for national reconstruction. They will take part in diverse\nactivities such as rural reconstruction, water maintenance, social\nforestry, public health, environment protection, social harmony,\nadult literacy and preservation of traditional knowledge systems.\nInitially, this scheme will be taken up on an experimental basis in\na few pilot districts from different parts of the country.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 216 11/7/2016 8:38:03 PM\n\f\nFamily and Society\n\nPreserving Integrity of the Family\n\nIN the Indian view of life, an individual is not an independent or\nsovereign being, but an integral member of the family, community,\nthe nation and the human race. The basic institution that anchors\nthe individual in society and the nation, as also links him to the past\nand the future, is the family. The BJP believes that the integrity of\nthe family institution is the main guarantor of India\u2019s civilizational\ncontinuity. Hence, the importance of protection and nurturing of\nfamily values cannot be overstated in the context of nation-building.\nIf the family is the brick, society is the edifice.\n\nOur Charter for Children: No Child Shall Go To Sleep Hungry\n\nTHE BJP believes that children are born\u2014and have the\nright\u2014to be happy; they have the right to food, shelter and clothes;\nthey have the right to education. But the facts as they exist paint a\ndismal picture. India has a high infant mortality rate. Many children\nsuffer from malnutrition and hunger. The majority of them have\nno access to education. Deprived of their childhood, millions of\nchildren have to work to feed themselves and contribute to the\nfamily income. Constitutional provisions and legal safeguards have\nbeen followed more in the breach than in practice. There are more\nchildren working in factories and fields than in schools; there are\nmore children living in deprivation than in secure homes. The BJP,\nin keeping with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, will\nensure that the \u2018best interests\u2019 of India\u2019s children are taken into\naccount in all situations. Children\u2019s rights are the foundation on\nwhich better societies can be built and, therefore, we will implement\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child in both letter and spirit.\n\nUntitled-5 217 11/7/2016 8:38:04 PM\n\f\n218 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nTowards this end, we will protect:\n\n1. Children\u2019s right to survive and develop to their full\npotential;\n\n2. Children\u2019s right to the highest attainable standard of health\ncare through compulsory health check and by strengthening\nthe ICDS;\n\n. Children\u2019s right to be registered immediately after birth;\n\n4. Children\u2019s right to protection from all forms of sexual\nexploitation and sexual abuse;\n\n5. Children\u2019s right to play;\n\n6. Children\u2019s right to education; and,\n\n7. Children\u2019s right to shelter.\n\nAs we step into the next millennium, child labour must be\nleft behind, consigned to history as completely as those other\nforms of slavery that it so closely resembles. We will amend the\npresent Child labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act to remove\nthe distinction between hazardous and non-hazardous processes.\nWe will achieve the goal of wiping out the scourge of child labour\nin factories and fields through:\n\n1. Regular and persistent inspections by labour departments\n\nat the Centre and in the States;\n\n2. Special annual campaigns to detect child employment;\n\n3. Identity cards which will be mandatory for all young\nworkers;\n\n4. Welfare benefits, especially social assistance to poor\nfamilies, aimed at ensuring a minimum income and thus\nremoving the need to rely on their children\u2019s labour;\n\n5. Free and compulsory primary education.\n\nNo nation has the moral authority to claim prosperity if its\nchildren are hungry. The BJP promises that by the year 2000, no\nchild who attends primary school will go to sleep hungry. We will\ndevice a suitable scheme with full community participation to keep\nthis solemn promise.\n\nOQ\n\nCaring for our Disabled\n\nAS many as fifty million Indians are denied the chance to\nparticipate in the nation-building process because of their physical\nand other disabilities. Rather than recognize the contributory\n\nUntitled-5 218 11/7/2016 8:38:04 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 219\n\npotential of these differently abled men and women, they are socially,\neconomically and politically marginalized. Successive Congress\nGovernments, as well as the UF regime which made cynical use\nof the slogan of \u2018social justice\u2019, have done nothing to empower the\ndisabled. Budgetary allocation to help the disabled amounts to\nless than pittance. Parliament passed a Bill for the welfare of the\ndisabled, but it is yet to be implemented in both letter and spirit.\nThe BJP will adopt a holistic approach towards the disabled so that\nthey are able to contribute their mite to the nation-building process\ninstead of being condemned to the margins of society. Towards\nthis end, the BJP will:\n\n1. Conduct a special census to collect accurate data about\nthe number of disabled people and the nature of their\ndisability in order to formulate an effective policy;\n\n2. Emphasize on empowerment and development of the\nabilities of the disabled into specific skills;\n\n3. Ensure access to public services and public places, to begin\nwith in metropolitan cities;\n\n4. Provide employment in suitable categories of Government\nservice through a pro-active \u2018equal opportunities\u2019\nprogramme;\n\n5. Offer incentives to the private sector to introduce a similar\n\u2018equal opportunities\u2019 scheme in suitable job categories;\nand,\n\n6. Encourage State Governments to set up centres for\ncounseling and skill acquisition.\n\nCaring for our Senior Citizens\nINDIAN family and social traditions have always held elders\nin high esteem. A person who attains the status of an \u2018elder\u2019 and\na \u2018senior citizen\u2019 is looked upon as a repository of experience,\nvalues and wisdom, which need to be transmitted to the younger\ngeneration. Sadly, the alien nature of socio-economic development\nin India in the past fifty years has brought the institution of family\nunder great pressure. One of the worst victims of this process are\nour senior citizens.\n1. Our Government, in line with the BJP\u2019s philosophy, will\ntake all possible measures to alleviate the difficulties and\n\nUntitled-5 219 11/7/2016 8:38:04 PM\n\f\n220 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nhardships suffered by our senior citizens.\n\n2. We will also support and encourage all societal efforts to\nrestore the traditional respect and regard for the elders.\n\n3. A person who retires after long years of service does not,\nby the very act of retiring, lose his ability to contribute\nin his field of expertise. Our Government will prepare a\ndecentralized database of such skilled and knowledgeable\nindividuals, so that both Governmental and non-\ngovernmental agencies can use their services.\n\n4. Organizations of senior citizens will be encouraged to\nparticipate in consultative, advisory and, wherever possible,\nmanagerial capacities in the implementation of suitable\nGovernmental programmes.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 220 11/7/2016 8:38:04 PM\n\f\nOur Policy on Environment\nEcological Security for Sustainable Development\n\nTHE BJP believes in the traditional Indian position that Nature\nis sacred. The Atharva Veda sets out the principle that Nature is\nthe mother of humans and that humans owe a responsibility to\nmaintain the ecological balance. The BJP will ensure institutional\nmeasures to bring about ecological security so that all developmental\nprogrammes are in conformity with the principles of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nIt is essential to ensure production with lower inputs of energy,\nwater, chemicals and at lower costs. This will call for significant\nscientific research, new technologies and implementation strategies.\nTo deal with these critical problems, the BJP Government will:\n1. Introduce a National Environment Policy incorporating\na healthy balance between development needs and\npreservation of natural resources. The interests of States\nand consultation with them will be fully ensured. To\nimplement the policy, the Ministry of Environment and\nForests will be recast as the Ministry for Ecological Security;\n\n2. Formulate a programme for developing sustainable cities\nwith special emphasis on urban planning, safe drinking\nwater, waste management and lowering the use of natural\nresources like water through recycling and reduced usage\nintensity.\n\n3. Implement better management and harnessing of river\n\nwaters as well as sources of ground water;\n\n4. Control land, air and water pollution by industry and\n\nurban centres. Municipal sewage treatment plants will\nbe made obligatory;\n\nUntitled-5 221 11/7/2016 8:38:04 PM\n\f\n222 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\n5. Revive the faith of the people that Nature is sacred and make\nenvironment studies part of school, college and university\ncurricula. Also, make environment issues an integral part\nof the visual media so that our children develop a caring\nand protective attitude towards the ecological system that\nsustains our lives;\n\n6. Protect the traditional and other rights of Vanvasis and\nGirijans over forest resources and produce;\n\n7. Involve local Self-governments at all levels (panchayats,\nnagar palikas and zila parishads) both in villages and\ncities, in implementing the National Policy;\n\n8. Provide easy access to information on conservation and\nsustainable use of natural resources;\n\n9. Ban the import of hazardous chemical wastes for recycling\nby any industry or for dumping;\n\n10. Minimize the use of non-biodegradable material for\npackaging by the consumer non-durable products industry;\n\n11. Restrain the conversion of forests or grazing areas for\nother purposes;\n\n12. Adopt afforestation policies to be fulfilled within a\ngiven time frame and prevent the degradation of forest\nby natural or manmade causes. The cornerstone of the\nBJP\u2019s forest policy will be a part of the total framework\nof land management, adoption of a dynamic programme\nof productive forestry and moving to private investment\nin forestry from total State management of forests. A\nprogramme will also be drawn up for conversion of\ndegraded forests, wasteland and marginal land into quality\nforests;\n\n13. Deny exploitation of offshore resources, especially marine\nlife, by big trawlers;\n\n14. Promote research and development in environment-related\nissues and eco-technology for application in agriculture,\nindustry and the services sector;\n\n15. Provide incentives to manufacturers of eco-friendly\nproducts;\n\n16. Not sanction tourism-related projects that disturb the\nenvironment and cause degradation;\n\nUntitled-5 222 11/7/2016 8:38:04 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 223\n\n17. A major effort will be mounted to clean up our river\nsystems and other water bodies;\n\n18. Develop machinery for prevention, integration and\nmanagement of national disasters;\n\n19. Encourage energy conserving techniques in all areas o\nproduction.\n\n \n\noO\n\nUntitled-5 223 11/7/2016 8:38:05 PM\n\f\nOur Policy on Science & Technology\nR&D for People\u2019s Welfare\n\nTHE BJP firmly believes science and technology has a very important\nrole to play in bringing about sustainable national development and\nin transforming India into a prosperous, strong and self-confident\ncountry. The BJP is proud of the achievement and capabilities,\nscientific and technological community of the country. The BJP\nendorses the basic philosophy outlined in the Scientific Policy\nResolution of 1958 and the Technology Policy Statement of 1983.\nThe BJP will increase public outlays on scientific research; and also\nensure that the potential of science and technology to improve the\nlot of vast sections of our society living below the poverty line and\nto bring about a more equitable society is fully harnessed. The BJP\nis committed of the urgent need to ensure integration of efforts\nin science and technology with the development programmes in\nthe various socio-economic sectors. The BJP recognizes that while\nscience and technology has a very important role to play in the\ncreation of wealth and improving the material conditions of the\nsociety, it is also a vital component in enriching the mind, enlarging\nthe human spirit and creating a thinking society. Towards this end,\nthe BJP Government will:\n\n1. Foster scientific mind and attitude among the people, using\nall the available powerful techniques of the mass media\nand in the various languages of the country; and support\nlocally-funded non-governmental organizations in their\nefforts in this regard;\n\n2. Ensure the use of science and technology in all important\ndevelopmental sectors for increasing production and\nproductivity, efficiency and for generating employment;\n\nUntitled-5 224 11/7/2016 8:38:05 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 225\n\n3. Simplify administrative and financial procedures for\nefficient functioning of scientific institutions;\n\n4. Implement a vigorous programme to enrich science and\ntechnology subjects at all levels of education;\n\n5. Provide capital grants on a selective basis to restore\nuniversity-and national laboratory infrastructures,\nparticularly to replace obsolescent research and teaching\nequipment;\n\n6. Halt the decline in funding of civil research and\ndevelopment and prepare a national budget for public and\nprivate-sector investment in research and development so\nas to increase the outlay on R&D.\n\n7. Introduce effective measures to stimulate a substantial\nincrease in private investment in industrial research and\ndevelopment and innovation; and assist in raising capital\nfor start-up and growth;\n\n8. Provide incentives for formation of regional/local\ncollaborative networks including \u2018Technology Parks\u2019\nand for strong linkages involving universities, national\nlaboratories and industry in research and development;\n\n9. Ensure the creation of a network of centres for application\nof science and technology in rural areas, particularly,\nfor implementation of \u2018lab-to-land\u2019 programmes and to\ndevelop a strong low-cost agro-industrial base with focus\non decentralized employment;\n\n10. Create conducive work environment and facilities to\nretain the best scientists in the country and enthuse young\nscientists to pursue science as a career;\n\n11. Safeguard national interests and our intellectual\ndevelopment, strengthening the innovation base,\ndeveloping patents awareness and related infrastructure;\n\n12. Support and accelerate research in high priority areas\nof basic research as well as in underpinning enabling\ntechnological areas such as informatics, new materials\nand biotechnology;\n\n13. Launch at least 10-15 time-bound result-oriented national\nscience and technology missions of societal relevance to\nharness the fruits of scientific research for welfare of our\n\nUntitled-5 225 11/7/2016 8:38:05 PM\n\f\n226 * 1998 Manifesto\n\nsociety;\n\n14. Provide fullest support so that India can be at contemporary\nleadership level, in carefully selected areas, particularly\nwhere it has advantages and where outstanding individuals,\ngroups and institutions exists.\n\n15. Strengthen mechanisms for increased, meaningful and\nrelevant interaction with the global scientific community.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 226 11/7/2016 8:38:05 PM\n\f\nOur Policy on Information Technology\nMaking India a Software Superpower\n\nRECENT advances in Information Technology (IT) have enshrined\nIT as the most revolutionary tool ever created in known human\nhistory. IT promises to transform every facet of human life and\nusher in a knowledge-based society in the next century. It has\nalready been delivering on some of these promises. The world\nof computers, telecommunication, television, the Internet and all\nother media is converging very rapidly, shrinking, in the process,\nPlanet Earth into a Global Village. This has opened up infinite and\npreviously unimaginable new possibilities in work, education,\ncommunication, commerce, manufacturing, agriculture, services,\nhealth-care, leisure and entertainment. It will influence the working\nof our political and democratic institutions, too.\n\nAlthough India lagged behind in the earlier phases of the\nIndustrial Revolution due to historical reasons, she has served notice\nof soon emerging as a major global IT power. Indian computer\nscientists and professionals \u2014 both those serving in India and abroad\n\u2014 have shown with their achievements that they have the potential\nto make our country a front-runner in the age of Information\nRevolution. The BJP attaches a high priority for accelerating this\nprocess. Specifically, we will do the following:\n\n1. Unveil a National Informatics Policy with a strategic 10-\nyear perspective to fully harness the benefits of IT in every\nsphere of our national life;\n\n2. Create awareness that IT is not a luxury, but the very\nbackbone of future development;\n\n3. The biggest contribution computers and the Internet can\nmake is in the field of education. Our IT policy shall strive\nto take India towards the goal of universal computer literacy\nand Internet access in the shortest possible period;\n\nUntitled-5 227 11/7/2016 8:38:05 PM\n\f\n228 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\n4. Make India a software superpower by giving all-out\nencouragement to software companies to grab a large\nshare of the global market. Our aim is to have software\nexports increase by ten times in the next five years;\n\n5. The BJP will endeavour to provide, by the year 2000,\ncomputers and facilities for computer education in all\nsecondary schools in the country, including those in rural\nand remote areas, which otherwise have basic facilities\nlike a proper building and power;\n\n6. Formulate a bouquet of policy initiatives to support,\nwithin a competitive environment, Indian IT companies\nand professionals to rapidly expand the scale of their\noperations and to enable them to take the Indian IT flag\nall across the globe;\n\n7. Provide broad-band nationwide communication links using\nsatellites, optical fiber-cables and wireless. No region will\nbe without this essential IT infrastructure;\n\n8. Ensure the fast nationwide onset of the Internet, Intranet\nand Extranet as part of the global and national information\nsuperhighways. These will be evolved to carry mail,\nfinance and banking, electronic commerce and all other\nmultimedia communication needs in the shortest possible\ntime at the least cost;\n\n9. Quickly collect, compile and reformat all official records,\nespecially those which have a direct bearing on the\ncountry\u2019s economic progress and the average citizen's\ninteraction with Governmental agencies, into a usable\nelectronic format;\n\n10. Network, through the Internet, Intranet, Extranet, local\narea networks and wide area networks, all limbs of\nthe Government to facilitate quick, multiway flow of\ninformation amongst ministries, departments and key\nadministrative functionaries. This will help the Government\nwork faster, more efficiently and in a more pro-people\nmanner; and,\n\n11. Facilitate our schools, colleges and universities, in al\npossible ways, to harness the rich knowledge resources\navailable on the Internet to improve the standard o.\neducation.\n\n \n\noO\n\nUntitled-5 228 11/7/2016 8:38:05 PM\n\f\nOur Policy on Media, Cinema, Arts\nFreedom with Responsibility\n\nWHILE the BJP believes in the traditional Indian position of Ano\nBhadraha Kritavayo Yantu Vishwataha (Let noble thoughts come to\nus from all sides), it equally believes in the Gandhian dictum that\nwe should keep our windows open for fresh air to come in, but\nkeep the walls intact, so that we are not blown off our feet. This\nis the guiding principle of the BJP in its approach to the media.\n\nConsistent with this, the BJP would enact rules to ensure that\nownership of the media is in the hands of natural-born Indians only.\nWhile, a limited extent of 20 per cent foreign equity investment\nmay be allowed in the electronic media in view of its large capital\nrequirements, no investment will be allowed in the other media,\nincluding the print media. On the use of editorial matter from\noutside in electronic media, the BJP would ensue that the safeguards\npresent in Article 19 (2. of the Constitution are fully implemented\nto balance freedoms and public interest.\n\nVoluntary Normative Standards for Media\n\nTHE BJP believes that, a healthy polity and democracy cannot\nsurvive without the support of an extra-political moral order\nwhich the democratic political order cannot itself impose on its\ncitizens. This belief is also the emerging belief of more advanced\ndemocracies that are experiencing a steep slide in morality which\nis endangering the very idea of orderly society. These decaying\nsocieties are beginning to understand that no society, especially a\ndemocracy, can long endure without the consensus of the majority of\nits citizens to some normative moral code. Within the boundaries of\nthis code, cultural diversity can flourish, outside of which it quickly\n\nUntitled-5 229 11/7/2016 8:38:06 PM\n\f\n230 * 1998 Manifesto\n\ndegenerates into a jungle of conflicting special interests enveloped\nin moral chaos.\n\nWhile world shrinks, India will have to provide against such\ndanger in our society too. Fortunately, at the family and social levels,\nthe age-old \u2018dharma\u2019, which is distinct from religious practice, acts\nas an extra-political normative moral order. But the normative\nmoral order or dharma needs to be protected and preserved as it is\nalready under pressure. With this end in view, the BJP will strive\nfor a national consensus with the involvement of all sections of\nthe Indian society for a voluntary moral standard for the media,\nfor the media plays a very important role both in fostering and\nprejudicing such a moral order. The inherent idea behind such a\nmoral code may be summarized as under:\n\n1. Promotion of family values and extended family\nrelationships to preserve its character as a basic socio-\neconomic and socio-cultural unit.\n\n2. The importance of religious faith in moulding human life,\nwith due understanding that religions should not conflict;\nnor should there be uniformity.\n\n3. Projection of regard and respect for women and\nmotherhood.\n\n4. Criticism of political parties and personalities, without\neroding the self-confidence of the nation.\n\n5. Promotion of interest in Indian traditions, history, literature,\narts and values as a source of emotional support and\nas a link with the nation\u2019s past, thus strengthening the\ncivilizational and cultural roots of the country and its\npeople.\n\n6. Entertainment as an embodiment of the traditional Indian\nview of \u2018Navarasa\u2019 so that it does not degenerate into a\nsource of amoral living.\n\n7. Healthy development of an open and scientific mind, the\nspirit of adventure and patriotism among the youth.\n\nThe BJP will ensure that the rights of free speech of Indian\ncitizens are guaranteed and will promote the availability throughout\nIndia of a diverse range of radio and television services offering\ninformation, entertainment and education. A BJP Government\nwill ensure the development of a non-partisan Indian expression\n\nUntitled-5 230 11/7/2016 8:38:06 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 231\n\nthrough programmes which, while reflecting Indian attitudes,\nopinions, ideas, values and artistic creativity would, at the same\ntime, encourage rational thinking, a scientific temper and lead\nIndian society to modernity in the 21st century.\n\nThis is an indicative and not exhaustive idea on the subject.\nThe BJP Government will start a nationwide debate on this concept\nof a voluntary moral code and strive to evolve a consensus.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we will:\n\n1. Improve the provisions of the Prasar Bharati Act to let\nPrasar Bharati organize an effective public broadcasting\nsystem, which would be accountable to Parliament but free\nfrom Government control, immune from political influence\nand sensitive to the diverse needs of Indian society.\n\n2. While permitting, by license, the entry of private enterprise\nand investment in radio and television broadcasting, purely\non commercially acceptable terms determined by bids, we\nwill ensure that:\n\n(a) The uplinking of television programmes will be from\nIndia.\n\n(b) Foreign equity investment in audio-visual media is\nrestricted to 20 per cent.\n\n(c) Management of all types of the media is in Indian\nhands.\n\n3. Ensure, by law, that there is appropriate statutory guidelines\nfor the content of the broadcast in line with the terms of\nArticle 19 (2. of the Constitution of India.\n\n4. Ensure and encourage the availability of a variety and\nplurality of views and diversity in programming by\ndiscouraging monopolies and maximizing the number of\nvoices, which can use the mass media. We will, therefore,\nimpose appropriate cross-media and cross-platform\nrestrictions and also restriction on investment by media\nin cable-TV companies and vice-versa.\n\n5. Facilitate the development of an efficient and competitive\nIndian broadcasting industry by providing a level playing\nfield to the nascent Indian industry vis-a-vis a highly\ndeveloped foreign-based broadcasting industry.\n\n6. Encourage providers of both public and commercial\n\nUntitled-5 231 11/7/2016 8:38:06 PM\n\f\n232 \u00a9 1998 Manifesto\n\nbroadcasting services to be responsive to the need for\nfair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest\nincluding matters of local significance and respect\ncommunity standards in the provision of programming.\n\n7. Ensure the providers of broadcasting services lace a high\npriority on the protection of children from exposure to\nprogrammes that may be harmful to them.\n\n8. Ensure the adaptability of the Indian broadcasting system\nto scientific and technological change.\n\n9. Create an exclusive \u2018Kisan Channel\u2019 in Doordarshan.\n\n10. Establish an independent autonomous public authority\ncomprising representatives of all sections and interests.\nThis authority will regulate broadcasting and set up a\nsystem to address complaints.\n\n11. Evolve a strategic plan to strengthen India\u2019s national news\nagencies like PTI and UNI to let them become influential\nglobal players in the shortest time.\n\n12. Economic security and social welfare of working journalists\nshall be ensured. The Working Journalists Act, 1955 shall\nbe further strengthened and steps shall be taken for proper\nimplementation in all media establishments.\n\n13. Freedom of the Press shall be ensured and protected at all\ncosts.\n\nCinema\n\nPOPULAR cinema has played an important role in promoting\nsocial harmony and nationalism, apart from providing inexpensive\nentertainment to the masses. However, in recent years, popular\ncinema, increasingly funded by the underworld, has had a negative\nimpact on society, especially on impressionable young minds. Sex\nand violence on the screen is beginning to gnaw at the moorings\nof our cultural ethos. The BJP is committed to checking this abuse\nof popular cinema. A BJP Government will:\n\n1. Allow movie-makers through suitable provisions in law\nto raise resources from financial institutions to curb the\ninfluence of underworld financiers and Mafia dons.\n\n2. We will provide a \u2018green channel\u2019 clearance for the\nautomatic certification of movies that do not have explicit\n\nUntitled-5 232 11/7/2016 8:38:06 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 233\n\nscenes and dialogues of violence and sex. Producers of\nsuch movies will not have to wait in the queue for Censor\nBoard clearance. Deterrent punishment will be meted out\nto any movie-maker who abuse this facility and to theater\nowners who screen such movies.\n\n3. Exempt quality movies, which will be certified \u2018Q\u2019, from\nentertainment tax.\n\n4. Encourage viewers to form local Darshak Sanghs \u2014 on the\nlines of consumer organizations \u2014to monitor the quality\nof movies being screened in their area.\n\n5. Set up theaters at all district headquarters and large\npopulation centres for screening art and popular movies.\n\n6. Reserve 50 per cent of the places on the Censor Board and\nCensor Panels for women.\n\n7. Create a special fund for promoting regional cinema.\n\n8. Introduce legislation to ensure minimum wages and\nretirement benefits for movie artistes and crew.\n\nIn the field of performing and literary arts, our broad approach\nwill be:\n1. Preservation, propagation and popularization of our\ndiverse cultural heritage.\n2. Creativity and experimentation.\n\n\u00bb\n\nNational integration through arts.\n\n4. Taking arts to the people and bringing people\u2019s arts to\nnational limelight.\n\n5. Recognition and honour of and support to outstanding\npersons in creative pursuits.\n\n6. Debureaucratization of arts and culture and freeing them\nof excessive Governmental interference.\n\n7. Creation of basic supportive infrastructure for arts and\n\nculture in all the States.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 233 11/7/2016 8:38:06 PM\n\f\nAchievements of Governments in\nBJP-Ruled States\n\nTHE Bharatiya Janata Party has provided the people with a clean,\nefficient and purposeful administration in the States where it is\nin power. We have pursued pro-people policies, implemented\nprogrammes that have benefited millions of lives and, above all,\nmaintained peace and communal amity. Peace and prosperity for\nall has been the hallmark of our State Governments in Rajasthan,\nUttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra (where we share power with\nthe Shiv Sena), Punjab (where we share power with the Akali Dal)\nand Haryana (where we share power with the Haryana Vikas\nParishad). In Uttar Pradesh, although the BJP has been in power\nfor a few months now, far-reaching decisions have been taken and\naction initiated to restore rule of law in a State that had come to\nrepresent \u2018jungle raj\u2019 during prolonged Central rule. Attempts have\nbeen made by our adversaries to destabilize these Governments,\nbut they have failed.\n\nWith a firm, but fair hand our State Governments have\ncracked down on criminal and anti-national activities. The\ncriminal-politician-bureaucrat nexus that had emerged during\nCongress rule in these States has been smashed. In Maharashtra,\nthe underworld mafia has been put on the run. Our Governments\nhave attached significant attention to maintaining law and order,\nwhich has contributed to the economic well-being of the masses.\nComplaints of corruption have been vigorously followed up with\nimpartial inquiries. Prompt action was taken wherever it was called\nfor without fear or favor.\n\nSpecial attention has also been paid to the problems of farmers\n\nUntitled-5 234 11/7/2016 8:38:07 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 235\n\nand socially disadvantaged sections of society.

Steps to make process of employment more transparent and\nensure that the deserving get jobs. Cut-back in avoidable\nGovernment expenditure. Discretionary powers to allocate\nland removed.\n\n5. Rapid industrialization through special projects. Several\nnew industrial units have been set up, generating jobs\nand higher levels of income.

The Council also articulates,\nfrom time to time, the aspirations of the States vis-a-vis the Centre.\nIt has played a major role in formulating fiscal demands of the\nStates and in seeking to resolve problems plaguing Centre-State\nrelations. The Council has formally met thrice-in Gandhinagar,\nMumbai and in Jaipur. After each meeting, a document has been\nreleased, listing areas of commonality, programmes of action and\nsuggested measures for the Union Government for harmonious\nrelations with the State Governments.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 239 11/7/2016 8:38:08 PM\n\f\nTowards a New Culture of National\nConsensus and Responsible Citizenry\n\nCONSENSUS-building is an essential part of nation-building.\nCooperation for the larger good of the nation has been a cornerstone\nof our civilization. Yet, one of the many baneful contributions of\nthe Congress Party to India\u2019s post-Independence polity has been\nthe politics of confrontation and negativism. The BJP believes\nthat, in a multi-party democracy likes ours, constructive dialogue,\nconsultation and cooperation between the ruling and opposition\nparties is, not only desirable, but essential. It has become all the\nmore necessary since several major national issues confronting\nIndia today cannot be effectively addressed without evolving a\nbroad platform of national consensus.\n\nSome of the issues where such a national consensus is most\nurgently called for are: electoral reforms; Centre-State relations;\npopulation policy; empowerment of women by legislating 33 per\ncent reservation for them in all elected bodies; inter-state water\ndisputes; environmental protection; and effective institutional\nguarantees for the welfare of the weaker sections of society in the\ncourse of economic reforms.\n\nSpecifically, our Party and Government shall do the following:\n\n1. We shall not practice \u2018political untouchability\u2019 vis-a-vis\nany party;\n\n2. In all issues of national importance where a national\nconsensus is needed, we shall adopt a policy of dialogue\nand consultation with other political parties;\n\n3. The consultative mechanisms and procedures in Parliament,\ntowards which the Congress Party always had a casual or\ncontemptuous attitude, will be revived; and,\n\nUntitled-5 240 11/7/2016 8:38:08 PM\n\f\n1998 Manifesto * 241\n\n4. We shall actively seek the views, suggestions and, wherever\nfeasible, participation of citizens and organizations outside\nthe sphere of politics.\n\nAn equally important dimension of democracy and nation-\nbuilding, which the Congress Party totally neglected in the past five\ndecades, is the need to build a responsible citizenry. Democracy is\nnot only about rights, but also about responsibilities and duties.\nHowever, since the rulers themselves threw their responsibilities to\nthe winds and turned Statecraft into crass commerce and politics into\nan unscrupulous power game, the average Indian naturally became\ncynical about politics. His awareness about his responsibilities as\na citizen weakened and, to that extent, his conscious contribution\nto nation-building also diminished.\n\nAs the adage Raja kaalasya kaaranam (The ruler is responsible\nfor the times) reminds us, the blame for this sad of State of affairs\nrests with the Raja and not the Praja. The BJP pledges that, when it\nis in power, the people will see a qualitative change in the culture\nof governance. There will be a marked change in the mindset and\nbehavior of those in Government. Their duties and responsibilities\nwill take precedence over their perquisites.\n\nThough such a change in the culture and content of governance\nis the first prerequisite for building a New India, it alone is not\nenough. A change in the mindset and behavior of citizens in their\ndaily lives is also equally necessary for building a strong, prosperous\nand proud nation. On the occasion of the Swarna Jayanti of our\nIndependence, therefore, the BJP makes the following appeal to\nevery Indian to inculcate the spirit of the Freedom Movement:\n\n1. \u2018We, the people of India, shall not discriminate on the\nbasis of caste, creed, class, gender, language, or region in\nany of our actions and decisions in life. Instead, we shall\nbehave with all our compatriots in the belief that we all\nare equal children of Bharat Mata.\u2019\n\n2. \u2018We, the people of India, in whichever profession or\nvocation we are in, shall work with honesty, dedication\nand discipline in the spirit of a New Work Culture.\u2019\n\n3. \u2018We, the people of India, shall always give priority to\nour patriotic duties and responsibilities over narrow self-\ninterest, even as we zealously strive for the realization o\nour rights enshrined in the Constitution.\u2019\n\n \n\noO\n\nUntitled-5 241 11/7/2016 8:38:08 PM\n\f\nThe BJP\u2019s Appeal to Dear Countrymen\n\nTO translate this manifesto into reality, we appeal to our all\ncompatriots to vote for the BJP and its allies to power in the elections\nto the 12th Lok Sabha. A moment comes when the right choice can\nchange the course of a nation\u2019s history. This is the moment to make\na decisive choice between the BJP and a decrepit, morally bankrupt\nCongress; between the BJP and opportunist parties that have no\nideological conviction like the Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party;\nand between the BJP and the Communist parties who have a hideous\nhistory of betrayal of the national interest at every crucial juncture.\nIn the coming election:\n\u00a2 The choice is between stability and another mid-term\nelection soon.\n\u00a2 The choice is between an able Prime Minister and prime\nministerial pretenders.\n\u00a2 The choice is between a Government that will change the\nlife of every Indian for the better or one that will make a\nbad condition still worse.\n\u00a2 The choice is between nationalism and a Foreign Hand.\nThe BJP gives a solemn assurance to the people of India: \u2018We\nshall sincerely strive to fulfill all the commitments set out in the\nmanifesto. If the BJP is voted to power, the India that enters the 21st\ncentury and the next millennium, will be an India that will hold her\nhead high and whose citizens will be enjoying the long-awaited\nfruits of progress made possible by a Government committed to\nSu-raj (good governance). Guided by a 10-year perspective, our\nGovernment will aim to achieve what others could not in the last\nfifty years. Our victory will be people\u2019s victory. It will be the victory\nof Bharat Mata.\u2019\nOo\n\n \n\nUntitled-5 242 11/7/2016 8:38:08 PM\n\f\nBJP\u2019s 10-Point Freedom Charter\n\nWe'll do in 10 years what others couldn\u2019t in 50.\n1.

A right\nturn - and the country would be well on its way to fulfilment. A\nwrong turn - and the country would be in serious trouble.\n\nThe electoral contests so far have been mainly bouts between\nvarious shades of Congressmen. Today for the first time Bharatiya\nJanata Party the Party of Independent India, offers itself as an\nindependent and complete alternative to the current confusions.\n\nThe country has been advancing at snail\u2019s pace when it has\nnot actually been declining. Prices are rising and employment\ngeneration rate is falling. The foreign debt trap is closing on us.\nCommunal violence has rocked several States. For the first time\nin history we had immolations by the frustrated flower of Indian\nyouth. State-Centre relations are seriously strained. Opportunistic\nalliances have brought Democracy itself into disrepute. Secessionism\nhas raided its ugly head in Punjab, Kashmir and Assam. And what\nis worse, there is sinister cooperation between these separatist\nterrorists and the people\u2019s war group in Andhra and LTTE in Tamil\nNadu. In the face of this challenge, other parties have gone casteist\ncommunalist or both.\n\nDifferent Political Parties exploited even the tragic Gulf War\nto carve out and comer communal Vote banks. The leaders of these\nparties have conclusively proved themselves non-leaders. Taking\nadvantage of this confusion, communists are making attempts to\ngain some respectability. .\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party as the party of Nationalism,\nHolism and Integral Humanism, offers a complete, new and higher\nalternative to the current dismal scene. As the party of Swadesh\nand Swa-dharma, it is wedded to our country, our people and\n\nUntitled-7 319 11/7/2016 10:04:50 PM\n\f\n320 * 1991 Manifesto\n\nour culture. It believes in consensus and cooperation, and not in\ncontrariety and conflict. It would uplift the poor and the down-\ntrodden, without pitting caste against caste, without inciting class\nagainst class.\n\nAs the party of law, order and justice, it would ensure the\nsecurity of life, limb and honour of all citizens. It seeks the restoration\nof Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya only by way of a symbolic\nrighting of historic wrongs, so that the old unhappy chapter of\nacrimony could be ended, and a Grand National Reconciliation\neffected. Hindus and Muslims are blood-brothers. But on account\nof historical reasons their relationship has not been harmonious.\nIt shall be the endeavor of BJP to make all Indians fraternal and\nfriendly once again.\n\nBJP is no prisoner of any dogmas. We will debureaucratise the\nEconomy to maximise production. We will make even the Sarkari\nSector productive and profitable by throwing open some of the\npublic sector units to people\u2019s participation.\n\nThe BJP will modernise the country on the basis of Science\nand Technology, even while strengthening the cultural roots of\nour national life. We want to do a thousand things to uplift the\npeople and upgrade the country. And we have the first Principles,\nthe sound policies, the wise leadership and the dedicated cadres\nto do them and do them well.\n\nTowards A Clean Political System\n\nFrom the Himalaya to Kanya Kumari, this country has\nalways been one. We have had many States, but we were always\none people. We always looked upon our country as Matribhoomi,\nPunyabhoomi. The Atharva Veda says \u2018Janarn bibhrati bahuda\nvivachasam\u2019 -Nana Dharmanam Prithvi yathou kasam.\u2019\n\n(This our motherland gives equal protection to people speaking\ndifferent languages and professing different faiths).\n\nWe have never had a theocracy, with a State Religion, in\nIndia. In fact, it is not possible in India because of its inherent\nmagnanimous cultural heritage. This being our tradition there is\nno room for discrimination against anybody on grounds of caste,\ncreed, language or region. It is the duty of the state to ensure justice\nfor all citizens and for all sections of society. The Bharatiya Janata\n\nUntitled-7 320 11/7/2016 10:04:50 PM\n\f\n1991 Manifesto * 321\n\nParty is wedded to National Unity and National Integrity and a\nbalanced development of all regions and all sections. To these ends\nwe will have, politically, not only a strong centre but also strong\nautonomous States.\n\nLaw And Constitution\n\nThe polity will accordingly, be reformed along the following\n\nlines:\n\n1. BJP favours restructuring of Centre-State relations in view\nof the quick economic development and decentralisation.\nBJP will implement the Sarkaria Committee Report on\nCentre-State relations;\n\n2. Article 356 permitting dissolution of a State Government\nby the Centre, will invoke only when the Constitutional\nmachinery has in fact broken down and not to promote\nany partisan interest;\n\n3. The BJP recognises that regional imbalances have developed\nin some states because of their size. The party would\nappoint a commission to report on formation of smaller\nstates which are economically and democratically viable.\nInitially BJP will have Uttranchal, Vananchal and Union\nTerritory of Delhi as three new states of the Indian Union;\n\n4. Certain regions in some States have an acute sense of\nneglect. These regions e.g. Ladakh and Jammu in J & K\nState, and Marathwada and Vidarbha in Maharashtra -\u2014\nwill be given Regional Development Councils;\n\n5. The States will be given a fairer share of Central revenues;\n\n6. We will appoint an Inter-state Council under Article 263\nto settle all inter-state and State-centre disputes;\n\n7. We will delete the \u2018temporary\u2019 Article 370 from\nthe Constitution, which more than anything else,\npsychologically separates J & K state from the rest of the\ncountry;\n\n8. Article 30 permits minorities to run their own schools. It\nwill be rationalised and suitably amended to ensure justice\n& equality to all irrespective of religions;\n\n9. We will guarantee to all minorities, whether religious or\nlinguistic, peace and security and full opportunities for\n\nUntitled-7_ 321 11/7/2016 10:04:51 PM\n\f\n322 * 1991 Manifesto\n\nprogress and development;\n\n10. We will set up a commission to study and report whether\nthe Presidential system of Government will give us a more\nstable Government than the present Parliamentary system;\n\n11. BJP will examine the feasibility of introducing list system;\n\n12. We will appoint a Law Commission to study various Civil\nLaws. ancient, medieval and modern, to evolve a Common\nCivil Law for the whole country to give our citizens a\nfeeling of unity and brotherhood;\n\n13. We will maintain a National Register of citizens;\n\n14. In place of the minorities commission and which entertains\ncomplaints of discrimination only from minority sections.\nWe will have a Human Rights Commission to look into\ncomplaints of injustice against any section of society.\n\nFair Elections\n\nFree and fair elections are the life-breath of democracy. From\ntime to time there are reports of doctored electoral rolls, booth-\ncapturing, physical violence. Money power and muscle power have\nassumed sinister proportions. To restore health to our electoral\nsystem we will:\n\n1. Arrange for public funding of elections;\n\n2. Introduce identity cards with photographs for all voters;\n\n3. Replace ballot boxes by electronic voting machines, to\nprevent rigging and booth-capturing;\n\n4. Give the right of vote by postal ballot to Indian citizens\nliving abroad;\n\n5. Permit company donations to parties - until State funding\nis introduced, to keep black money out of the political\nprocess;\n\n6. Strengthen the independence of the Election Commission\nby making its expenditure a charge on the Consolidated\nFund of India - as is the case with the Comptroller and\nAuditor General and the Supreme Court and various High\nCourts;\n\n7. Hold State Assembly and Lok Sabha Elections simultaneously\nand regularly every five years, avoiding, as far as possible,\nany mid-term polls;\n\nUntitled-7, 322 11/7/2016 10:04:51 PM\n\f\n1991 Manifesto * 323\n\n8. Give legal teeth to the Election Commission\u2019s Code of\nConduct by making violation of the same a corrupt practice\nunder the Election Law;\n\n9. Empower the Election Commission to, monitor Akashvani\nand Doordarshan broadcasts and ensure that the same are\nnot misused for any partisan purposes;\n\n10. Fix a realistic limit on a candidate\u2019s election expenses and\nthen include in it not only the money spent by him but\nalso by his party and friends; and\n\n11. Introduce public auditing of party funds.\n\nShri Ram Mandir At Janamsthan\n\nBJP firmly believes that construction of Shri Ram Mandir at\nJamnasthan is a symbol of the vindication of our cultural heritage\nand national self respect. For BJP it is purely a national issue and\nit will not allow any vested interests to give it a sectarian and\ncommunal colour. Hence party is committed to build Shri Ram\nMandir at Janmasthan by relocating super imposed Babri structure\nwith due respect.\n\nClean Public Life\nBJP attaches the greatest importance to the probity and quality\nof public life. To this end we will\n1. Inquire into all cases of serious corruption in high places;\n2. Require all those holding public office to make an annual\ndeclaration of their own and their dependents\u2019 assets;\n3. Set an example in simple living, to give a new, higher tone\nto public life.\n\nNorth-east\n\nWe have long had many problems in the North-East beginning\nwith Naga insurgency. And now we have a Bodo problem and also\nthe ULFA problem in Assam proper. BJP will examine outstanding\nregional and sectional problems, redress all legitimate grievances\nand, for the rest maintain law and order with a firm hand. To this\nend we will\n\n1. Have electrified barbed wiring all along the Indo-\n\nBangladesh border, to keep infiltrators out;\n\nUntitled-7 323 11/7/2016 10:04:51 PM\n\f\n324 * 1991 Manifesto\n\n2. Check and identify infiltrators, strike out their names\nfrom the electoral rolls and arrange to send them back to\nBangladesh;\n\n3. Declare all property deals between locals and infiltrators\nas null and void;\n\n4. Give all adult citizens in the North-East identity cards\nwith photographs, on a priority basis;\n\n5. To monitor and keep watch on receipt of foreign funds so\nthat it is not used for conversion in the garb of religious\nactivities;\n\n6. Abolish the Inner Line Permit System in all the seven\nNorth Eastern States;\n\n7. Safeguard the interests of bonafide refugees fleeing because\nof religious or political persecution in Bangladesh;\n\n8. Secure the honourable return of Chakmas to Chittagong\nHills, Bangladesh;\n\n9. Plan and organise an integrated and accelerated economic\ndevelopment of the North-East; and\n\n10. Incorporate Manipur and Nepali in the Eighth Schedule\nof the Constitution.\n\nPunjab\nThe BJP holds Cong. (I) wholly responsible for the Punjab\nproblem. Had the Congress Govt. not toppled the duly elected\nGovermnents, of Prakash Singh Badal, not once, not twice, but three\ntimes, there would have been no Bindaranwale, no -Blue Star\u2019, no\n\u2018Black Thunder\u2019. Later, it was the loot and murder of thousands\nof innocent Sikhs in Delhi and else-where in 1984 that has angered\nthe Sikhs, given a handle to Pakistan and encouraged terrorism.\nHowever, the fact that not all the machinations of Pakistan and not\nall the provocations of their terrorist agents, has soured Hindu-Sikh\nrelations, is proof positive that the heart of the Punjab is sound.\nTo mend matters in the Punjab, we will\n1. Create a kilometer-deep Security Belt all along the Indo-\nPak border - as has already been done by Pakistan on its\nown side - to prevent all movement of terrorists, smugglers\nand their lethal cargo;\n2. Post Army Units in the acutely disturbed border areas to\n\nUntitled-7 324 11/7/2016 10:04:51 PM\n\f\n1991 Manifesto * 325\n\nmaintain order and restore confidence;\n\n3. Give relief and provide rehabilitation to the widows and\norphans of 1984 outrages;\n\n4. Punish the guilty men of the 1984 terror; and\n\n5. Have the various grievances of the people of Punjab\nexamined in depth by experts, including social scientists\nand redress them suitably.\n\nJammu, Kashmir And Ladakh\nThe BJP views with concern the recent developments in the\nKashmir valley. Widespread violence in the State has led to an\nanarchical situation. This has paralysed tourism, the backbone of\nthe Kashmir economy.\nThe Pakistan - inspired violence against Hindus has caused\nthose Kashmiris to become refugees in their own land. The BJP will\n1. Weed out Pakistani elements from the valley;\n2. Hold free and fair elections in the State as soon as conditions\nstabilise there;\n3. Have separate Regional Development Councils for Jammu\nand Ladakh;\n4. Make relief and rehabilitation facilities available to Kashmiri\nrefugees, settling them particularly in the hills of Pir Panjal\nRange; and\n5. End all uncertainty about the future status of the State by\ndeleting Article 370 of the Constitution.\n\nTelangana\n\nEver since the Razakar excesses in 1947-48 and the Communist\nrebellion in 1948-50, the Telangana area of Andhra Pradesh has been\nmore or less disturbed. In the last few years, People\u2019s War Group,\na Naxalite outfit, has been virtually running a state within a state\nthere. The Congress (I) and T.D.P. have been competing for the\nsupport of P.W.G., which has been holding people to ransom and\nkilling scores of BJP men, and anybody else who would stand up\nto them. BJP will go to the root of the Telangana land problem and,\nfor the rest, crush the lawless elements and restore law and order.\n\nUntitled-7 325 11/7/2016 10:04:52 PM\n\f\n326 * 1991 Manifesto\n\nULFA\n\nUnder Congress (I) mismanagement, even a peaceful State\nlike Assam has produced a terrorist outfit like ULFA.\n\nHere again, BJP will redress legitimate grievances and for the\nrest, discipline unruly elements and restore order.\n\nLaw and Order\n\nThe BJP views with concern the alarming rise in social violence,\ninvolving different castes and communities. All this violence is\nmainly due to exciting feelings to carve out certain Vote Banks and\nthen cornering them. The party expects the District Administration\nto take all steps necessary to maintain Law and Order. Should there\nstill be any serious eruption of violence, BJP will\n\n1. Institute an inquiry;\nPublish the findings of such an inquiry;\nPunish the guilty;\nCompensate the victims; and\nTransform the Police Machinery into an efficient and\ndependable instrument of Law and Order.\n\nTe WN\n\nJustice And Judicial Reform\nIn a situation of rapid social change, the judiciary holds a\npivotal place. It can ease social tensions by dispensing quick,\ninexpensive and impartial justice. We are sorry to note that on\nall these counts the Judiciary\u2019s performance has been less than\nexemplary, particularly since the Congress (I) came up with the\nploy of a committed judiciary, that is a Judiciary committed to the\nruling party. To stop further erosion of this hallowed institution,\nand restore it to its earlier state, the BJP will\n1. Take suitable measures to clear the arrears;\n2. Through suitable measures BJP will ensure the cases, by\nthe large, are decided within one year;\n3. Discourage interminable adjournment of cases for years\non end;\n4. Improve the emoluments of judges to attract better talent;\n5. Raise the retirement age of High Court Judges to 65 - that\nof the lower judiciary to 60;\n6. Give attractive pensions to judges;\n\nUntitled-7 326 11/7/2016 10:04:52 PM\n\f\n1991 Manifesto * 327\n\n7. Enhance judicial powers of Nyaya Panchayats to ensure\nspeedy justice and to carry to the doorstep of the people;\n\n8. Provide mobile courts for the rural areas;\n\n9. To provide free legal aid to SC and ST to enable them to\nprocure their rights and position as SC and ST; and\n\n10. The role of executive in judicial appointment will be\n\nrationalised to keep it within the framework of spirit of\nthe Constitution.\n\nPanchayati Raj And People\u2019s Power\nThe Panchayat system formed the bedrock of the democratic,\nsocial and political set-up in India since Vedic times. It was this\ndemocratic set-up that absorbed the shock of invasions and protected\nthe integrity of Indian life. In modern times Gandhiji commended\n\u2018Power to the People\u2019 in a \u2018structure composed of innumerable\nvillages\u2019 in which there will be \u2018ever-widening, never-ending circles.\nLife will not be a pyramid with apex sustained by the bottom but it\nwill be an oceanic circle whose centre will be the individual.\u2019 Lok\nNayak Jaya Prakash Narayan also worked for Panchayati Raj and\nDeendayalji pleaded for a statutory status for the village Panchayat\nand the city municipality - in the Constitution. The BJP will\n1. Effectively decentralise power;\n2. Give a constitutional status to local bodies from Village\nPanchayats to Metropolitan City Corporations; and\n3. Involve the Panchayats in all rural development work\nand make 10 per cent of the Development Budget directly\navailable to them.\n\nEconomic Growth With Social Justice\n\nThe Indian economy has reached a point of total collapse as a\nresult of the knock-out blows it has been dealt, by a succession of\nprofligate and irresponsible governments led by Congressmen and\nex-Congressmen. These people have literally robbed the country\nand left its hapless citizens high and dry, staggering from one crisis\nto another and trapped in a rising vortex of high prices, murderous\ntaxes and soaring debts.\n\nThe nation is on the verge of bankruptcy and has been reduced\nto begging for hand-outs from all and sundry. Indian ambassadors go\nabroad to beg for loans and even the Prime Minister has to genuflect\n\nUntitled-7 327 11/7/2016 10:04:52 PM\n\f\n328 \u00a9 1991 Manifesto\n\nbefore heads of foreign nations. As a result India\u2019s international\nrating has sunk to a new low. India is one of the few countries in\nthe world without a proper government, without a proper budget\nand without a proper economic policy.\n\nThe net result is an upside-down economy in which farmers\nwho produce cotton cannot afford to buy cloth; and masons who\nput up five-star hotels, have no roofs over their heads. For certain\nconsumer durable there is no dearth of demand. It is estimated that\n60 per cent of the consumer durables are purchased by less than 40\ncent of the population. In other words, the Developmental effort\nduring the past four decades has resulted in a Socio-Economic\ndualism.\n\nAll these trends have to be reversed, and the Bharatiya Janata\nParty will reverse them. BJP government will \u2019 bring out White\npaper on State of the Economy soon after assuming power.\n\nThe core sector of our economy will be MAN. State should\nretreat from commercial activities and instead, concentrate on\nbasic functions such as maintaining law and order, justice, welfare\nprogramme, infrastructure etc. We will make our Economy truly\nSwadeshi by promoting native initiatives.

The Indian peasant is the\nsalt of the earth and he is the backbone of the country\u2019s economy.\nWhen he prospers, India prospers. We have waived the loam of\npoor agriculturists in Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and\nRajasthan. But the Kisan win continue to flounder in poverty\nunless the burden of people depending on agriculture is reduced.\nA countrywide network of agro-industrial complexes in rural\nareas should relieve the burden and provide the real answer to the\nproblem of poverty of the peasantry. BJP aims at rural development\nwhere farmer will not be forced to borrow.\n\nThe party has offered a new deal to the farmers in terms of\n\nits Charter of Rights of Kisan. The party will\n\n1. Ensure remunerative prices-to farmers;\n\n2. Ensure minimum wages to the farm labour;\n\n3. Ensure abundant supply of water and energy, the farmers\nhave a natural right on these basic inputs;\n\n4. Remove all restrictions on the movement of farm produce\nthroughout the country;\n\n5. Maintain parity of prices between agricultural and industrial\nproducts;\n\n6.

This would help to\n\nUntitled-7 329 11/7/2016 10:04:52 PM\n\f\n330 * 1991 Manifesto\n\ngenerate employment to rural youths who are not actually\nrequired in agricultural activities. e.g. Scientific storage\nfacilities, food processing units, cottage industries etc.\nInvestment in rural industries will be given appropriate\nfiscal incentives;\n\n11.

Restructure the Agriculture Cost and Price Commission and\nmake it more broad-based, with adequate representation\nto those engaged in farming.\n\nCow Protection And Cattle Wealth\nThe BJP recognises the fact that from times immemorial, cow-\nprotection has remained one of the basics of Indian culture and\nIndian agriculture, and it is on the patient back of the cow and its\nprogeny that the entire structure of Indian agriculture rests. Over\nseventy million animals are employed in farming operations in\nIndian villages, more than eighty percent rural transport needs are\nmet by the bullock-cart. Cow and its progeny continue to be the\nmajor source of power, manure and fuel, including bio-gas. Cow\nis also an effective protection against environmental degradation.\nThe BJP regretfully observes that about three million cows are\nslaughtered every year, most of them for export. The party would\nput a total ban on the slaughter of cows. It will\n1. Amend article 48 of Constitution to cover bulls and bullocks,\nand prohibit all trading (state as well as private) in the\nslaughter of cows;\n2. Implement a policy of Go-Samvardhan or development\n\nUntitled-7 330 11/7/2016 10:04:53 PM\n\f\n1991 Manifesto * 331\n\nof cow and cattle-breeding, including the improvement of\nsheep and goat breeds, to bring about a White Revolution\nin the country; and\n\n3. Provide tax exemption to the income of Goshalas and\nPinjarapoles.\n\nIndustrial Policy\n\nIndustry in India has to be much more productive and\ninnovative to be able to fulfill its main role viz provide employment\nin increasing numbers and inputs to other sectors, including\nagriculture. It has also to earn foreign exchange competition with\nthe rest of the world and create resources for overall growth. The\nBJP promises healthy investment environment so that entrepreneurs\nfind domestic market as more attractive and challenging.\n\nThe following four main principles will characterise the\nindustrial policy of the BJP\u2014\n\nA. Self-reliance:\n\nThe party regards self-reliance as an over-riding component\nin our external economic relations, including the import of capital\nand technology. We will keep multinationals out of consumer\nindustries.\n\nB. Modernisation:\n\nBJP believes in a modern and progressive India. Open to new\nideas, no matter where they come from provided they suit our\nrequirements and ethos. We will not allow technology to degrade\nman. Our people with their intelligence, industry and character\nare the true and abiding wealth of India.\n\nC. Decentralisation:\n\nThere is far too much power concentrated in the Government,\nand it must be decentralised. The party stands for political as\nwell as economic democrac, as also for an open society, where the\ngovernment has only an indicative and not a commanding role. It\nwill not be necessary for people to come to Delhi and waste time\nand money over licences and other clearances.\n\nUntitled-7 331 11/7/2016 10:04:53 PM\n\f\n332 * 1991 Manifesto\n\nD.

Encourage people\u2019s initiative in Public Sector Units\ninvolving trading, hotels, tourism, consumer goods, etc.,\nby offering them to the public in capital market with\nappropriate safeguards;\n\n5. Foster Swadeshi spirit in every economic and industrial\nactivity and reduce the country\u2019s dependence on foreign\ncountries and foreign agencies. Foreign capital will be\nencouraged in high-tech, import substitution and strictly\nexport oriented areas. Within the set guidelines clearance\nwill be given with minimum paperwork.\n\n6.

While conducive environment will be created to strengthen\ncapital market adequate measures will be taken to safe-\nguard interests of small equity holders.\n\nHandicrafts & Village Industries: To Play Pivotal Role\n\nBJP firmly believes that national goals such as employment\ngeneration, export earnings could be met through our ancient\ncraftmanship such as handloom & handicrafts, gems & jewelry\netc. For instance, investment of Rs. one crore in village industries\ncreates job opportunities for 202 persons while the same investment\nin organised industrial sector can provide job to only 48 persons.\nBesides, more than 40 per cent of our export earnings comes from\nthese so called smaller initiatives. BJP pledges to recognise their\nimportance in the national economy and look at them with enhanced\nexpectations.\n\n1. A separate ministry will be set up to look after interests\nof Handicrafts and village industries.\n\n2. To preserve and promote native Craftmanship \u2018National\nArtisan Development Bank\u2019 would be set up. Government\nwould contribute the necessary initial capital of this bank.\n\n3.

In government media such as T.V. native of artisans will\nget adequate coverage without fees.\n\nFiscal Reform\nThe current economic mess is a direct consequence of the\nmismanagement of the economy by the government.

Additionally we will\n\n1. Public distribution system would be streamlined so that\n\nneedy sections of the society would have access to essential\ncommodities at nominal prices. Under the present system,\npoorest section is forced o buy essential items on open\nmarket.

This is, in all conscience, a\nhigh degree of challenge to our territorial integrity and national\nsovereignty, with its consequential strains on the Indian Economy,\nthe Indian Polity and the Indian society.\n\nDiplomacy\n\nLike India, the world is also at cross roads. With the sudden\ndisappearance of bipolar divide of 45 years, the USSR and the US\nare no longer adversaries but partners. Curtain has finally been\ndrawn over the cold war that has dominated the world for most\nof the current century.\n\nInternational equations are changing fast. In the post cold\nwar period, neither the USA needs the third world countries to\ncontain communism nor does the USSR has any use now for its\n\u2018natural allies\u2019 in the developing world. As a result. non-alignment\nmovement which was created against the backdrop of a bipolar\nworld, has lost its relevance.\n\nThe new situation is a challenging one and at the same time\npregnant with several fresh opportunities to enlarge India\u2019s role in\nglobal affairs. But only economically healthy, militarily strong and\nprogressive India can carve out a niche for itself. As long as India\ngoes around with a begging bowl around the world, her voice in\nthe international affairs will not be heard with respect.\n\nPrevention is always better than cure. That Defence is best\nthat does not need to be invoked too often to defend our legitimate\nnational interests. And that, in turn calls for wise and integrated\nDomestic,, Economic and Foreign Polices. In the past, our foreign\n\nUntitled-7 350 11/7/2016 10:04:57 PM\n\f\n1991 Manifesto * 351\n\npolicy has suffered from inconsistencies. At times we have treated\nit as an exercise in verbal gymnastics and used it as a, feather ina\nPrime Minister\u2019s cap. At other times we have treated it - as was the\ncase only recently with the Gulf War \u2014 asa football, for irresponsible\nparties to kick it around. We are sorry to note that Foreign Policy\ndiscussion and formulation has not been institutionalised in India.\nAs a result the performance of our diplomacy has been spotty at best.\n\nPakistan and China continue to occupy territories lawfully\nours. Thousands of Tibetans continue to live in India as refugees.\nThe Pakistan Establishment is hostile, and even the Bangladesh\nEstablishment has been less than friendly. The situation in\nAfghanistan has fortunately stabilised. But the situation in Sri\nLanka is as disturbed as ever, with serious violence erupting on\nboth sides of the Palk straits. Burmans next door continue to suffer\ndictatorship. And Indians abroad continue to suffer discrimination\nin many lands.\n\nThe BJP is wedded to National interest and World Peace. To\n\nthese ends we will\n\n1. Set up a Policy Planning Committee of experts to formulate\na long-term Foreign Policy for India;\n\n2. Forge a national Consensus on Foreign Policy issues;\n\n3. Work for a stronger SAARC in view of the old bipolar\nworld giving place to a uni-polar World;\n\n4. Invite Pakistan to come forward to resolve out disputes\nin terms of the Shimla Pact and meanwhile develop\ncooperative economic and media relations;\n\n5. Promote the idea of aCommon Market of all SAARC states;\n\n6. Constitute a South Asian Environmental Protection\nAuthority, with representation from non-governmental\nenvironmentalists from all concerned countries;\n\n7. Continue the North-South Dialogue and promote South-\nSouth cooperation;\n\n8. Develop friendly and cordial relations with the countries\nof South-East Asia, with whom we have ancient bonds of\nblood and culture;\n\n9. Stand by persons of Indian origin abroad in defence of\ntheir legitimate rights;\n\n10. Give Dual Citizenship to Indian citizens abroad; and\n\nUntitled-7 351 11/7/2016 10:04:57 PM\n\f\n352 * 1991 Manifesto\n\n11. Strive to strengthen United Nations in view of the fact\nin the changed situation the world powers are more\ninclined to work-through the UN than unilaterally or even\nthrough older groups and factions. Strive to make India an\nautonomous power centre in the world with a permanent\nseat in the U.N. Security Council.\n\nDefence\nDiplomacy and Defence are two sides of the same coin, that is\n\na country\u2019s relation with the outside world. A sound Foreign Policy\n\nwill give us a secure base for a sound Defence policy. However,\n\nrecent events have shown that international relations continue\nto be governed by the law of the jungle. The way Iraq occupied\n\nKuwait and USA exceeded the UN resolutions to bring death and\n\ndestruction to both Kuwait and Iraq is a warning that we cannot\n\nafford to neglect our Defence. The BJP will\n1. Encourage an educated debate on national strategy as a\nroute to national security strategy;\n2. Set up a National Security Council to institutionalize\nforward planning;\n\nGive our Defence Forces Nuclear Teeth;\n\n4. Give ourselves a Blue Water Navy that will be the first\nNavy in the Indian Ocean from Singapore to Aden;\n\n5. Encourage Research and further Development on Arjun\nbattle tank, Light Combat Aircraft, Army Radio Engineering\nNetwork (AREN) and Prithvi and other missiles developed\nby Dr. Abdul Kalam;\n\n6.

The country cannot afford to miss this moment of\nhistory, this opportunity to throw out the rulers mainly responsible\nfor this country\u2019s ruination.\n\nThe BJP on its part has left no stone unturned in its efforts\nto put up a determined and united electoral battle and has\nunhesitatingly sacrificed its party interests whenever national\ninterests so demanded. The Bharatiya Janata Party calls upon the\npeople to join in its struggle for ushering in a new era of hope and\nprosperity, a value based polity and throw out this corrupt and\nincompetent Congressmen.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-7 353 11/7/2016 10:04:58 PM\n\f\n", "BJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 1989": "MANIFESTO\nLok Sabha Elections,\n1989\n\nCentral Office\n11, Ashok Road, New Delhi 110 001\nPhone Nos: 383349, 386586\n\f\nUntitled-9 356 11/7/2016 11:08:30 PM\n\f\nIntroduction\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party is wedded to the Unity and Integrity of\nIndia. It stands for Law and Order-for Justice, Social and Economic\nand for Security, Internal and External. It is committed to the uplift\nof the poor and the downtrodden. But BJP is sorry to note that the\nRajiv Government has disappointed the country on all these counts.\n\nIndia today is in the grip of a serious multidimensional crisis\nof unprecedented proportions. The national mood is not just of\ncynicism but of mounting disgust and rage, not unmixed with\nsorrow, at the steady deterioration in public morality at the topmost\nleadership level. The people feel sad that through an accident of\nhistory this great country should have been saddled with a coterie\nof small men who are not only incompetent and corrupt, but who\nlack a sense of commitment to the nation, its democratic institutions\nand cultural traditions.\n\nEvidence \u2018is mounting that the Prime Minister, whose personal\nprobity is now in serious doubt, has not only been bending words\nbut telling lies, distorting facts, changing versions, elbowing \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nministers of integrity and unabashedly misleading the Parliament\nand the Nation even on crucial issues of national defence and\nsecurity. The men at the top are not only without integrity but also\nwithout shame. In any other country, such a government would\nhave resigned long ago. But it is continuing in office and trying\nto subvert the democratic process by resorting to fascist methods,\nincluding mugging of the press, instigation of communal riots and\nsubversion of the judiciary.\n\nStark failure faces the country on all fronts. Accords have ended\nup in bloody discords. The Rajiv regime is bathed in blood and\nmuck from head to foot, from Punjab to, Assam and from Kashmir\n\nUntitled-9 357 11/7/2016 11:08:31 PM\n\f\n358 \u00a9 1989 Manifesto\n\nto Sri Lanka. Everything Rajiv Gandhi touches ends up ina bloody\nmess. A man who waded to his office through the blood-soaked\nstreets of Delhi will be leaving behind a gory legacy. This country\nis not safe in the hands of such a man or such a party. How can\nmen who lack integrity themselves, and are not above looting the\ncountry, defend the country and protect its integrity and honour?\n\nThe power and prestige of great institutions like the Parliament,\nthe Army and the Judiciary have been eroded; the press has been\nrepeatedly threatened and harassed; and the electronic media have\nbeen prostituted. The directive principles of state policy have been\nforgotten; the Mandal Report on the welfare of backward classes\nhas been pigeonholed; and never before has Indian womanhood\nsuffered insult and assault as during the last five years.\n\nBy negativing the Supreme Court judgment in the Shahabano\ncase, the government has put a premium on communalism and\nobscurantism. And by recognising Urdu as second official language\nin Uttar Pradesh on election eve, it has shown more interest in\nMuslim votes than in Urdu language. In the process it has only\ngiven the country so many corpses. By not allowing the rebuilding\nof the Ram Janma Mandir in Ayodhya, on the lines of Somnath\nMandir built by the Government of India in 1948, it has allowed\ntensions to rise, and gravely strained social harmony.\n\nAbout the situation on the economic front, the less said the\nbetter. During the last five years, prices have doubled and in many\ncases trebled; unemployment has soared by leaps and bounds and\nnational debt increased three times. And all this while the country\nhas been thrown open for plunder by foreign interests who are\ntaking out more from the country than they ever put in. The country\nhas paid out more to foreigners in the last five years than the entire\ndebt of farmers which the government refuses to write off.\n\nIn this enveloping darkness, the Bharatiya Janata Party stands\nas a beacon of light. It is wedded to Desh and Dharma, Samata and\nSamanvay. It stands for justice-social and economic-for all, for the\nKisan and the Jawan, for the young and the old, for the poor and\nthe downtrodden, for women and children, irrespective of class,\ncreed or gender. It also stands for law and order particularly moral\norder, for without such an order, the country cannot endure and\nflourish.\n\nUntitled-9 358 11/7/2016 11:08:31 PM\n\f\n1989 Manifesto * 359\n\nBJP rejects both exploitative capitalism and suppressive\ncommunism. Its approach to life and society, as expounded by our\nlate Pt. Deendayal Upadhyay, is integrative and holistic. It looks\nupon the farmer in the field and the worker in the factory as two\nmighty wheels of our modern Rashtra-rath. It believes that the nation\ncannot progress until those who have remained at the bottom of\nthe social pile for centuries are helped to elevate themselves and\njoin the mainstream on a footing of equality.\n\nBJP believes in positive secularism which, according to our\nconstitution-makers, meant Sarva-Dharma-Sama-Bhava and\nwhich does not connote an irreligious state. It certainly does\nnot mean rejection of our history and cultural heritage, the very\nfoundations of this great nation. The BJP stands for \u2018Justice for All\nand Appeasement of None\u2019.\n\nThis is what we are and this is what we aim to do. Come and\njoin us in the great enterprise of nation-building, in taking this\ncountry to great heights of prosperity and glory.

The BJP considers that\nit is also imperative for national integration that minorities do not\ndevelop a minority complex.\n\nIndian Constitution is quasi-federal. It envisages strong States\nwith a strong Centre. The BJP believes in maintaining a balance\nbetween the two as visualised in our Constitution.\n\nThe BJP also recognises that regional imbalances have\ndeveloped in some States because of their size. The party stands\nfor the formation of smaller states which are economically and\nadministratively viable. The BJP will\n\n1. Support and strengthen State Governments and not\n\ndestabilise and topple them;\n\n2. Give the states a fairer share of Central revenues and\n\nincrease the financial powers of the states;\n\n3.

Include in the limitative ceiling of election expenses all\nexpenditure incurred by the candidate, his election agent,\nhis party and supporters.\n\nClean Public Life\n\nCleansing of the public life will receive BJP\u2019s top priority. The\nparty holds that the roots of all corruption lie in political corruption.\nThe party recognises the urgency of evolving effective mechanism\nto break the unholy nexus between the corrupt bureaucrat, corrupt\nbusinessmen and the corrupt politician.

The rabid communal and pro-Pakistan elements are\nspearheading a massive hate India campaign in Kashmir valley and\nthe entire region is engulfed by widespread terrorism. The unabated\ninfiltration and smuggling all along the western border needs to be\neffectively curbed. The BJP suggests that\u2014\n1. Effective and immediate measures to weed out the\nforeigners from Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan and\nGujarat be taken;\n2. Border with Pakistan should be effectively guarded by\n\nUntitled-9 364 11/7/2016 11:08:32 PM\n\f\n1989 Manifesto * 365\n\ncreating a security belt to stop infiltration of trained\nterrorists and smuggling of arms and ammunition, narcotics\nand other contraband commodities; and\n\n3. A Regional Council for Jammu be formed so that regional\n12 imbalances in development be removed.\n\nLaw And Order And Protection Of Weaker Sections\nThe BJP views with alarm the rise of social violence in the\ncountry. This includes communal violence, atrocities on Scheduled\nCastes and Tribals, and criminal assaults on women. The BJP\nbelieves that the weaker sections need an effective protection from\natrocities and the Party is committed to the security of life, limb,\nproperty and honour of all citizens. In case of a serious eruption\nof violence, the BJP commends that \u2014\n1. A judicial inquiry will always be held;\n2. The inquiry report will be published;\n3. Those guilty of incitement to violence or dereliction of\nduty will be punished;\n4. All not sufferers will be suitably compensated and\nrehabilitated;\n5. An indepth socio-economic study of riot-prone areas to\ntake effective steps for riot-prevention will be conducted;\n6.

Political meddling in police work be stopped and a\nmachinery for redressal of Police/ People\u2019s griveances be\ncreated.\n\nJustice And Judicial Reforms\nThe BJP believes that without an independent judiciary, it\nis impossible to have the Rule of Law. Also the judicial system\nshould be speedy, inexpensive and just. The BJP would under-take\nthe following measures to restore the independence, integrity and\nefficiency of the judicial system \u2014\n1. Take effective measures to provide free legal aid to the\npoor and specially the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and\n\nUntitled-9 365 11/7/2016 11:08:32 PM\n\f\n366 * 1989 Manifesto\n\ngradual abolition of the Court-fees;\n\n2. Simplify the legal procedures and increase the number of\njudges so that majority of the cases are disposed of within\none year;\n\n3. Provide mobile courts for the rural areas and set up Nyaya\nPanchayats with judicial powers;\n\n4. Offer better service conditions and emoluments to judges\nat all levels;\n\n5. The Chief Justice of India should have the final say in the\nappointment of the High Court and Supreme Court Judges\nto be recommended by an independent body;\n\n6.

Appoint special courts for different categories of cases so\nthat pending cases in various High Courts and Supreme\nCourt are cleared within one year; and\n\n9. Introduce social security measures like provident fund\nand group insurance schemes for the advocates.\n\nDecentralisation Of Power And Panchayati Raj\n\nThe Panchayat System formed the bedrock of the democratic\nfunctioning of the Indian Social System since the Vedic period.\nMahatma Gandhi and Jay Prakash Narayan were strong votaries of\nlocal self-government. The Jana Sangh under the leadership of Pt.\nDeendayal Upadhyay had always canvassed for the Constitutional\nstatus of the Panchayats and Municipal boards.\n\nThe BJP believes in decentralisation of power and strengthening\nof democracy at the grass roots.\n\nThe party ensures a Constitutional status to the Panchayats\nand other local self institution and assured share of resources so\nthat they do not depend upon discretionary grants.\n\nThe BJP will neither impose Panchayats from above nor will\nuse them to bypass the State Governments. Oo\n\n \n\nUntitled-9 366 11/7/2016 11:08:32 PM\n\f\nNational Economy\n\nThe Indian economy is presently going through an acute crisis.\nIn fact it has been stagnating since the last ten years and more so\nsince 1985. The per capita availability of the items of staple diet\nof the nation, in these years has gone down. The nation is more\nundernourished today than it was few years ago. As a result of\nwrong plan priorities, the country is producing more colour TV\nsets, but not enough steel, more computers but not enough power,\nmore fancy cars but not enough buses, more superfine fabrics but\nnot enough cheaper varieties of dhoties and saries. The result of this\nlopsided elitist sense of priorities, combined with corruption and\nprofligacy, is that today there are more people looking for jobs than\never before, more landless farmers than ever before, more illiterates\nthan ever before. The consumer is groaning under the burden of\nback-breaking prices. There is more sorrow than happiness, more\npoverty than wealth.\n\nThe BJP hold the ruling party squarely responsible for\ndeliberately neglecting the agriculture sector in pursuit of mythical\nmodernisation.\n\nForty years ago, the disparity between the farmer and his\ncounterpart in other sectors was not very large. Today it is one to\nthree; soon, it will be one to four. A country that treats its farmers\nwith contempt is bound to remain mired in poverty, as India is.\nThe Country is again resorting to imports of foodgrains after so\nmany years, which in itself is a tell-tale commentary on the mess\nthat has been made on the farm front, in fact, in respect of the\nentire economy. Thanks to the wrong policies of our rulers over\nthe years, thousands of crores of rupees from the rural poor have\nbeen transferred to the urban rich, resulting in a colossal rural\n\nUntitled-9 367 11/7/2016 11:08:32 PM\n\f\n368 * 1989 Manifesto\n\nindebtedness. The BJP will reverse all these ugly trends and give\nthe country a humane economy. It will take all steps necessary to\nachieve full employment, maximise production, stabilise prices\nand eradicate poverty and rural indebtedness. For this BJP offers\nthe following programme:\n\nAgriculture\n\nIn the opinion of the BJP the speedy development of the\nagriculture and rural sector is the key to India\u2019s prosperity. The\nparty recognises that more than 65 per cent of Indian farmers are\npoor, they need capital and subsidised inputs for their rapid growth.\nThe Kisan will continue to flaunder in poverty unless the burden\nof people depending upon agriculture is reduced. A network of\nagro-industrial complexes in the rural areas is the real answer\nto the problems of poverty of the Indian peasantry. The party is\ncommitted to implement its Charter of Rights of Kisan.\n\nThe BJP offers a new deal to the farmers and it will\u2014\n\n1. Write off the debts of the farmers, agricultural labourers\nand rural artisans;\n\n2. Allocate sixty percent of the plan money, both Central\nand State, for rural development, agricultural and allied\nservices;\n\n3. Ensure remunerative prices to the farmers, computed after\ntaking into consideration all the parameters like cost of\ninputs and living index etc;\n\n4, Ensure minimum wages to farm labour;\n\n5. Maintain parity of prices between agricultural and industrial\nproduce;\n\n6. Remove all restrictions on the movement of agricultural\nproduce throughout the country;\n\n7. Arrange abundant and regular supply of water and energy;\n\n8. Introduce crop and cattle insurance schemes which would\nguarantee adequate compensation in case of crop failure,\ndamage or loss due to natural calamities or outbreak of\nepidemics in cattle; also update the age old famine code;\n\n9. Provide market value compensation in one instalment in\ncase of land acquisition and rehabilitation of the uprooted\nin the process;\n\nUntitled-9 368 11/7/2016 11:08:33 PM\n\f\n1989 Manifesto * 369\n\n10. Issue Pass Books to Kisans and implement the land laws;\n\n11. Reclaim all wasteland and give special attention to dry\nfarming;\n\n12. Speedily complete the on-going big irrigation projects,\ntake up thousands of small and minor irrigation projects,\norganise efficient flood management and relief;\n\n13. Encourage the cultivation of pulses, oil-seeds, fruits, nuts,\nand other cash crops;\n\n14. Protect the traditional rights on village forests and Nistar\nLand;\n\n15. Speedily provide the minimum civic facilities like drinking\nwater, roads and other means of communication, public\nhealth and hygiene;\n\n16. Organise the purchase operations through a wide and\nefficient network so as to ensure that all farmers and\nparticularly the small farmers realise the guaranteed price\nand are not forced to make a distress sale; and\n\n17. Restructuring the Agriculture Cost and Price Commission\nso that two-thirds of its members are drawn from those\nengaged in farming.\n\nCow Protection And Animal Standard\n\nThe BJP notes with concern that in spite of the clear provision\nof the Constitution in Article 48 and the Supreme Court\u2019s emphasis\nthat cow protection is a constitutional mandate and slaughter of\ncows is not enjoined in any religion including Muslim religion,\ncomplete prohibition of cow slaughter has yet not been introduced\nin various States of India, specially in West Bengal and Kerala.\n\nThe BJP recognises the fact that from times immemorial Cow\nprotection has remained one of the basic tenets of Indian culture\nand it is on the patient back of the cow and its progeny that the\nentire structure of the Indian agriculture rests. Over seventy\nmillion animals are employed in the farming operations in Indian\nvillages, more than eighty percent rural transport requirements\nare met by the bullocks. Cow and its progeny continue to be the\nmajor source of power, manure and fuel including bio-gas. Cow is\nalso an effective protection against environmental degradations.\n\nThe BJP regretfully observes that about three million cows\n\nUntitled-9 369 11/7/2016 11:08:33 PM\n\f\n370 * 1989 Manifesto\n\nare slaughtered every year and most of them for export. The party\nwould put a total ban on the slaughter of the cows. It will\n1. Amend the Article 48 of the Constitution to include bulls,\nand bullocks, and to prohibit State-trading in slaughter\nof cows; to ensure that no-one has a fundamental right of\ntrade or business to slaughter cows; and to incorporate\nthe subject of Cow-protection in the concurrent list;\n2. Implement a policy of Go-Samvardhan or development\nof cow and cattle breeding including the improvement of\nSheep and Goat breeds to bring about a white revolution\nin the country; and\n3. Provide tax exemption to the income of Gashalas and\nPinjarapoles.\n\nIndustry\n\nThe BJP\u2019s industrial policy flows from the following\n\nprinciples \u2014\n\n1. Self-reliance: The Party\u2019s industrial policy would be\nstrongly nationalistic in approach and content.\n\nThe party, would like to keep multinationals out of the\nfield of consumer industries. The party regards self-reliance\nas an overriding component in our external economic\nrelations, including the import of technology and capital.\n\n2. Decentralisation: The party stands for political as well\nas economic democracy, so that the benefits of economic\ndevelopment go to the smallest man. The party believes\nthat for this decentralisation of economic power, presently\nconcentrated in the hands of the state or of big business,\nis necessary. Primacy for agriculture and Agro-based\nindustries, Swadeshi and importance to the small and\nmedium scale sector in industry are commitments that\nflow from this.\n\n3. Modernisation: BJP will harness new technologies to the\nchanging requirements of the country, and build India\nas a modern and progressive nation. But it will not allow\ntechnology to degrade man as just another input in Gross\nNational Product. Man will be the main focus of our\ndevelopmental policies.\n\nUntitled-9 370 11/7/2016 11:08:33 PM\n\f\n1989 Manifesto * 371\n\n4. Daridra Narayan Sewa: Consistent with the above three\nelements, the party will aim at securing to every Indian\ncitizen minimum conditions of material welfare in terms\nof food, raiment, shelter, health and education.\n\nThe party will leave no stone unturned in carrying jobs\nto the people. Generation of employment will be a major\ncomponent of BJP\u2019s industrial policy.\n\nBJP will encourage and improve industry all-round. We will\u2014\n\n1. Make the public sector productive and profitable; its\nmanagement will be professionalised and a Central service\ncalled the \u2018Indian Management Service\u2019 will be formed\nto select, train and allocate the professional managers to\nthese units;\n\n2. Demarcate the spheres of multi-national corporations, big-\nscale industry, small-scale industry and cottage industry;\n\n3. Ensure that the existing patent laws safeguarding Indian\nnational interests remain intact under external pressure;\n\n4. Cut down the plethora of controls which presently exist,\nand which breed corruption and dampen enterprises, and\nmaintain only such of these restrictions as are necessary\nfor social justice;\n\n5. Foster the spirit of Swadeshi;\n\n6. Reserve more and more consumer items to small-scale\nand cottage sectors;\n\n7. Make credit more cheaply available to small-scale industry;\n\n8. Modernise industrial plants; and ensure fuller utilization\nof capacity;\n\n9. Promote agro-based industries;\n\n10.

Publicly honour excellence in industry and commerce;\nand\n\n13. Provide tax and non-tax incentives to companies for\nmaking permanent workers share-holders out of a part\nof their gross profit.\n\nUntitled-9 371 11/7/2016 11:08:33 PM\n\f\n372 \u00a9 1989 Manifesto\n\nNational Textile Policy\n\nThe BJP recognises the need to have an integrated textile policy\nand would ensure protection to handloom and cottage sectors\nof textile industry. To this end the party will demarcate the role\nof each of the Sectors viz. organised sector or mills, powerloom\nand handloom sectors, and Khadi and cottage industries. The\nParty would ensure cheap clothing to the poor and national and\ninternational market to various sectors. The handloom sector would\nreceive adequate protection. The interests of cotton growers would\nalso be duly safeguarded.\n\nTaxation\n\nBJP would adopt firm and bold measures to prevent generation\n\nof black-money.\n\n1. Rationalise and simplify the entire tax structure. The\nhighest rate of income tax shall be 40 per cent;\n\n2.

With this view the party\nwill evolve a well coordinated wages, prices and profits policy.\nThe BJP will\n1. Appoint a Price Commission to regulate the prices of\nmanufactured goods both in private and public sector;\n2. Fully and promptly neutralise any rise in prices by increased\nDA in both private and public sectors and in private and\nGovernment service, including Central, State and local\ngovernment;\n3.

Nobody should be\npermitted to pocket super-profits. The party also recognises the need\nto enforce strict measures of quality control and price regulation.\nWith this view the BJP will\n1. Build a powerful consumer movement and formulate\na price and profit policy for industrially manufactured\ngoods;\n\nUntitled-9 373 11/7/2016 11:08:34 PM\n\f\n374 \u00a9 1989 Manifesto\n\n2.

Reservation should be continued for the Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes as before;\n\n2. Reservation should also be made for other backward classes\nbroadly on the basis of the Mandal Commission Report,\nwith preference to be given to the poor among these very\nclasses; and\n\n3. As poverty is an important contributory factor for\nbackwardness, reservation should also be provided for\nmembers of the other castes on the basis of their economic\ncondition.\n\nPhysically Handicapped\nThe BJP accepts the rehabilitation of the physically handicapped\npersons as a component of Social Welfare.

Associate students\u2019 unions with the management of student\nwelfare programmes.\n\n%\n\nLanguage\n\nThe BJP supports the principle that people have a right to\nbe educated and run their administration in their own language.\nThe BJP will\n\n1.

Include Nepali in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nHealth And Nutrition\n\nHealth care to all citizens is the primary duty of the State.\nA majority of children born in families below poverty line are\nundernourished and show sign of mental retardation chiefly due to\nprotein deficiency. BJP, therefore, considers hygiene, sanitation and\nnutrition as more important than medicines and hospitals. We will\n\n1. Along with Allopathy, recognise and promote Ayurveda\nand Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy, Chromopathy and\nNature Cure and in general encourage holistic healing;\n\n2.

The party would unhesitatingly\napply appropriate scientific and technological methods for increasing\nproductivity, eradicating poverty, hunger and disease and to provide\nmeaningful employment along with \u2018the basic amenities of life to\nthe vast percentage of population living below the poverty line.\nThe party holds that science is not merely harnessing nature for\nmaterial wealth but is as well liberating and enriching mind and\nenlarging the human spirit. The BJP would use science in the service\nof the poor and would develop technology with a human face.\n\nThe party is equally concerned about the rising trends of brain\n\ndrain. The BJP will\n\n1.

We will\n\n1. Evolve a new dynamic national sports policy aiming\nat bringing 10 per cent population on the playgrounds\n\nUntitled-9 385 11/7/2016 11:08:36 PM\n\f\n386 * 1989 Manifesto\n\nand winning medals in Olympic and other international\ncompetitions;\n\n2.

Respect the Olympic charter and autonomy of the sports\nbodies and will prohibit governmentalisation of sports.\n\nFamily Welfare And Population Policy\n\nThe BJP recognises the growing concern of the people about\nthe dangers of a demographic explosion and distortions created\nby the mishandling of the population control programmes by\nthe Congress(I) government. The BJP is committed to the policy\nof responsible parenthood and believes that population control\nprogramme should be given top priority while formulating national\nplans. It expects all sections of Indian community to fully participate\nin these programmes. The BJP will\n\n1. Strive for creating a national consensus for adopting a\nNational Population Policy and if necessary to take suitable\nlegislative measures for it;\n\n2.

In the opinion of the BJP, the rapid depletion of natural\nresources, risks of green house effect, the destruction of tropical\nrain-forests, and the hazards of dumping of industrial waste and\ndischarge of highly toxic materials in air and water are matters of\nglobal concern and world opinion has to be alerted against them.\nInternational efforts are needed to save the planet. Preservation\nof environment has been an integral part of Indian way of life. We\nlook upon India as Bharat Mata and a holy land. Our land, air,\nwaters, our hills, forests, flora and fauna are all sacred to us. We\nwill keep them neat, clean and intact. We will\n\n1. Formulate a National Resources Management Policy and\nadopt a holistic approach in planning;\n\n2.

Make environmental concerns an integral part of education;\nand\n\n9. Take special care in import of technology and promote\nresearch for developing indigenous pollution free\ntechnology.\n\nNO gs\n\nCulture\nThe BJP believes in preserving and propagating the cultural\nvalues which have kept India united through the ages. It will\n1. Conserve the ancient heritage of India and make people\nfeel proud about it;\n2. Promote Indian values of life through cultural centres;\n\nUntitled-9 387 11/7/2016 11:08:36 PM\n\f\n388 \u00a9 1989 Manifesto\n\n3. Acquaint people with the glorious traditions and\nachievements of ancient Indian genius in the fields of\nscience, technology, medicine, agriculture, etc;\n\n4. Wage a relentless war against superstitions and outmoded\ncustoms; and\n\n5. Emphasise on culture as a dynamic and synthetic process.\n\nArts\n\nArts is the essence of life. BJP will encourage all art forms. It\nwill make the various arts, part of Education, Production and Life.\n\nTo promote theatre, BJP will, as a rule, exempt all theatrical\nperformances from entertainment tax.\n\nThe BJP will encourage folk art in various fields.\n\nFilms\nBJP recognises the great role of cinema in entertainment,\neducation and national integration. BJP will\n1. Have, in addition to \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018U\u2019 Films, \u2018Q\u2019 that is Quality\nfilms, which will be exempt from entertainment taxes;\n2.

Promote tourism both national and international as an\nindustry and give incentives to those who take it as a\nprofession;\n2. Will evolve a policy of integrating tourism and marketing\nof handicrafts and other art works;\n3.

Joshi Report on TV software to improve\nthe quality of TV programmes.\nOo\n\n \n\nUntitled-9 389 11/7/2016 11:08:37 PM\n\f\nNational Security\n\nThe BJP holds that National security is a primary responsibility of\nState. Security of the nation is an integrated whole: an amalgam\nof the internal, the economic, the social, the political, the military\nand the diplomatic. The BJP will, therefore, resolve the social and\npolitical turmoil in strategically sensitive border states like Jammu\n& Kashmir, Punjab, North East and Assam. Indian diplomacy can\nassist in the protection of our national interests only if it is guided\nby a purposeful foreign policy.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nThe conduct of diplomacy by the Rajiv Government has left\nIndia\u2019s foreign policy in tatters. Never has the country faced so\nmuch animosity from so many of our neighbours, as today. It\nis BJP\u2019s view that the challenges, we face in the field of external\nrelations, arise from a re-assertion of the altered importance of\nnon-alignment, as a concept, in a rapidly transforming world. It\nis our view that increasingly, we should give emphasis to foreign\neconomic policy under the time-proved concept of non-alignment.\nIt is vital to move the world towards a greater and more effective\nNorth-South and South-South Co-operation.\n\nThe BJP has stood for, and is committed to mutually beneficial\naim of good bilaterial relation with all our neighbours and a\nstrengthening of SAARC. We stand for a normalisation of relations\nwith China, with due safeguards for Tibet, proper recognition of\nIndia\u2019s national interests and honourable solution of the border\ndispute. We would work for a comprehensive package of settlement\nof all outstanding matters with Pakistan and a widening of the\npeople-to-people relations between our two countries. We would\n\nUntitled-9 390 11/7/2016 11:08:37 PM\n\f\n1989 Manifesto * 391\n\nwork for an early withdrawal of the IPKF from Sri Lanka. With\nNepal BJP would seek the re-establishment of harmonious relations\nbased on the concept of interdependent growth.\n\nThe BJP stands for a foreign policy committed to world peace,\ndisarmament and a non-exploitative new international economic\norder. The Party will\n\n1. Work towards re-imparting dynamism to the non-aligned\n\nmovement;\n\n2. Pursue a policy of peace, friendship and co-operation with\n\nneighbouring countries;\n\n3. Reject the domination of super-power interest in South\n\nAsia and the Indian Ocean;\n\n4. Work towards the establishment of a regional common\n\nmarket by strengthening South Asian Regional Conference;\n\n5. Work for the establishment of a new international economic\n\norder, take initiative for trade and monetary reform, North-\nSouth dialogue with emphasis on enhanced South-South\nCo-operation;\n\n6. Continued efforts for the world-wide rejection of apartheid;\n\nand\n\n7. Continuously work towards the solution of problems of\n\npeople of Indian origin living abroad.\n\nDefence\n\nDefence preparedness has suffered grievously in the hands of\nRajiv Government gripped as it is, by ad-hocism and by corruption\nsurrounding defence procurements. This has brought to a standstill\nall policy-making and implementation within the Defence Ministry.\nThe other great harm that Rajiv Government has caused to the\ncountry is excessive misemployment in an adventurous manner,\nof the Indian Armed Forces on Political roles or on militarily\nunattainable tasks. This has caused a very serious lowering of\nthe morale of our Armed Forces, and hence of its total combat\neffectiveness. BJP wishes to caution the nation against the extremely\nharmful consequences if such a situation is permitted to continue.\n\nThe BJP would work actively towards reviving the morale\nof the Armed Forces, giving a solemn assurance that the Indian\nArmed Forces, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, would not\n\nUntitled-9 391 11/7/2016 11:08:37 PM\n\f\n392 \u00a9 1989 Manifesto\n\nlack either in equipment or in the necessary where withals to\nexecute their responsibilities.\n\nThe BJP will exert for \u2014\n\n1. Optimum defence preparedness including production of\n\nnuclear bombs and delivery systems;\n\n2. Diversification of sources of suply of defence hardware,\ncontinued emphasis on maximising indigenous production,\nself-reliance and Defence Research and Development;\nGreater public accountability of defence expenditure;\nEnhancement of Indian Navy\u2019s capability;\n\n5. Identification, and elimination of, foreign lobbies associated\n\nwith defence weapons procurement and contracts; and\n\n6. Improve service conditions in the Armed Forces so as\n\nto make careers in the Army, Navy and Air Force more\nattractive to the best talent in the country.\n\nThis then is the programme which the BJP pledges to implement\nunder the inspiring leadership of Shri A.B. Vajpayee and Shri L.K.\nAdvani. The dedicated cadres of the party, headed by these brilliant\nleaders of impeccable record of clean public life and selfless service\nto the nation, are committed to usher in a new political culture. In\nthe opinion of the BJP a critical moment of history has arrived for\nIndia. The country can not afford to miss this moment of history,\nthis opportunity to throw out the last vestige of the dynastic rule\nmainly responsible for this country\u2019s ruination.\n\nThe BJP on its part has left no stone unturned in its efforts\nto put up a determined and united electoral battle and has\nunhesitatingly sacrificed its party interests whenever national\ninterests so demanded. The Bharatiya Janata Party calls upon the\npeople to join in its struggle for a value based polity and throw\nout this corrupt and incompetent government.\n\neo\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-9 392 11/7/2016 11:08:37 PM\n\f\n", "BJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 1984": "TOWARDS A NEW\nPOLITY\n\nELECTION MANIFESTO\nLOK SABHA ELECTION-1984\n\f\nUntitled-8 394 11/7/2016 11:07:19 PM\n\f\nIndian polity today stands at a critical crossroad of history. The state\nof the nation is examplified by the breakdown of law and order,\nan absence of purpose and direction in governance, deep divisions\nwithin society marked by deliberately engineered communal and\ncastesist passions, and a serious erosion of institutions. Near about\nhalf our citizens continue to groan under the dehumanising yoke\nof abject poverty aggravated by spiraling prices. Urban chaos and\nrural neglect have degraded the quality of our citizens\u2019 life.\n\nThe shocking assassination of the late Prime Minister\nand subsequent occurrences are the most horrifying and telling\nsymptoms of erosion of moral authority and a total decay of the\nruling party.\n\nAt such a critical juncture a new direction and a fresh political\ninitiative was expected from the successor government. Betraying\nall hopes, the government of the day, mired in immobility, a\nprisoner of the old caucus, continues cynically to repeat yesterday\u2019s\nirrelevancies. When decisive action is called for, it merely mouths\nplatitudes and attempts to transfer responsibility by accusing others.\n\nNational integrity, unity, and cohesion are the paramount need\nof the hour; the reestablishment of national consensus a primary\ntask. Today\u2019s challenge cannot be met by yesterday\u2019s government.\n\nThe need of the hour is a new polity, anew government, a new\nleadership. In the new polity we stand committed to value-based\npolitics, to democracy, to positive secularism, and to Gandhian\neconomics.\n\nIndia needs a new government which is clean, effective\npurposeful and representative of the rich diversity of our land.\nSuch a government must restore the moral authority of the State,\ncommit itself afresh to the integrity of the nation and guarantee\nthe security of every single citizen of the country. This Republic of\n\nUntitled-8 395 11/7/2016 11:07:19 PM\n\f\n396 \u00a9 1984 Manifesto\n\nours elan no longer be left a Prisoner of the corrupt and criminal.\nTo fulfill this task the Bharatiya Janata Party offers to the\nnation the following programme.\n\noO\n\n \n\nUntitled-8 396 11/7/2016 11:07:19 PM\n\f\nNational Politics\nNational Unity And Positive Secularism\n\nBJP is pledged to defend the unity and integrity or India it believes\nthat India, from Kashmir to Kanya Kumari, is one country, and all\nIndians, irrespective of language, caste or creed, are one people.\n\nUnity in diversity has been the hallmark of Indian culture,\nwhich is a unique multi-heud synthesis of the cultural contributions\nmade over the centuries by different peoples and religions. In\nIndian tradition, since times immemorial, the State has always\nbeen a civil institution, which makes no distinction between one\ncitizen and another on grounds of his religion. The very idea of a\ntheocratic state is alien to Indian political history. So, when India\nbecame independent in 1947, we very naturally declared ourselves\na secular state, unconcerned that Pakistan had opted for theocracy.\n\nIt is this positive concept of secularism to which BJP is\ncommitted. Secularism should not be allowed to become a\neuphemism for appeasement, alternately of this community, or\nthat, or a sordid political device to garner bloc-votes.\n\nOurs is a democratic federal Constitution. It envisages strong\nStates, with a strong Centre. Indeed the whole cannot be strong\nunless the constituent parts are strong too. But over the years the\nStates have been increasingly reduced to glorified municipalities.\nThe BJP will restore the balance between the Centre and the States\nas visualised by our constitution makers. And to that end, it will:\n\n1. Support and strengthen state Governments and not\n\ndestabilize and topple them;\n\n2. Appoint State Governors in consultation with State\n\nGovernments;\n\nUntitled-8 397 11/7/2016 11:07:19 PM\n\f\n398 \u00a9 1984 Manifesto\n\n3. Enact an anti-Defection Law;\n\n4. Limit the number of ministers to 10 per cent of legislators;\nas per the Report of the Committee on Defections;\n\n5. Give the states a fairer share of Central revenues and\nincrease the financial powers of the States;\n\n6. Delete the temporary Article 370 of the Constitution;\n\n7. Constitute an Inter-State Council under Article 263 to settle\nall Inter-State and State-Centre disputes;\n\n8. Guarantee to all minorities, linguistic and religious, peace\nand security, and full opportunities for progress and\ndevelopment.\n\nFair Elections\n\nThe BJP believes in the primacy of elections. It is convinced\nthat elections must be held regularly and very fairly. They must\nhonestly reflect the public mind. And the parties fighting these\nelections must also function democratically \u2014and cleanly.\n\nFour evils threaten to subvert the freedom and fairness of\nelections \u2014 money-power, ministerial-power, media-power and\nmuscle-power. The BJP is resolved to contain and curb all these evils.\n\nThe party will give high priority to electoral reform. More\nspecifically, BJP will \u2014\n\n1. Give the right of vote to all those above eighteen;\n\n2. Introduce Identity Cards for voters;\n\n3. Use electronic voting machines, and to this end, make\n\nnecessary changes in the election law;\n\n4. As recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee\non Amendments to Election Law, examine the feasibility\nof introducing the List system of elections;\n\n5. Give the right of Postal Ballot to Indian citizens living\nabroad;\n\n6. Hold State and Central elections simultaneously every\nfive years;\n\n7. Make the Election Commission a multi-member body;\nstrengthen its independence by making expenditure\nincurred on the Commission expenditure charged on the\nConsolidated Fund of India, as is provided in the case of\nComptroller and Auditor General and Supreme Court and\n\nUntitled-8 398 11/7/2016 11:07:19 PM\n\f\n1984 Manifesto * 399\n\nHigh Court judges, and by providing the Commission\nwith an independent, minimal infrastructure;\n\n8. Extend the jurisdiction of the Election Commission to local\nbody elections, and to ensure that elections to local bodies\nare held regularly;\n\n9. Arrange for public funding of elections, as is the case in\nGermany, Japan and most other democratic countries;\n\n10. Have party accounts publicly audited;\n\n11. To prevent abuse of governmental power by the ruling party,\ngive legal teeth to the Code of Conduct framed by Election\nCommission; violation of the code shall be made a corrupt\npractice under the law.\n\nCorruption\n\nIn the last 4 years or so corruption has not only become way\nof life but has in fact been institutionalized and legitimized. An\nunholy nexus has developed between the corrupt politician, the\ncorrupt bureaucrat and the corrupt businessman. The volume of\nblack-money has grown phenomenally and is now estimated at\naround 50 per cent of the total money in circulation.\n\nThe BJP holds that the roots of all corruption lie in political and\nelectoral corruption. While measures to cleanse elections have been\ndealt with earlier, with regard to political corruption in general,\nthe BJP will, inter alia, take the following steps:\n\n1. It will enact a law, and create an Ombudsman-Lokpal\nand Lokayaukta-as recommended by the Administrative\nReform\u2019s Commission; and\n\n2. Stramline procedures and rules relating to purchases\nawarding of contracts etc. in Government and public\nsector undertakings and regulate discretionary powers of\npolitical authorities; political interference and intervention\nin day-to-day End Government departments and public\nsector functioning of actions, dealing with purchases and\naward of contracts etc.; Rationalise and streamline the tax\nstructure, providing sufficient incentives to savings and\navoiding harassment to honest tax-payers and to avoid\ngeneration of black money; Require all Ministers to make\nan annual declaration of assets.\n\nUntitled-8 399 11/7/2016 11:07:19 PM\n\f\n400 \u00a2 1984 Manifesto\n\nOur North East\n\nAll our North Eastern States suffer from unsatisfactory,\neconomic development, insufficient recognition of local diversity,\ninadequate participation in National tasks, unchecked illegal\nimmigration resulting in demographic imbalances and serious\nsocial destablisation. The BJP believes that a resolution of all\nthese problems has to be undertaken jointly and keeping in mind\nthe peculiarities of the region. In this endeavor the Brahmaputra\nValley and the State of Assam play a crucial role. No integrated\ndevelopment of the region is possible if Assam continues to remain\nunstable.\n\nThe BJP will, therefore, give high priority to the solution of\nthe many problems afflicting Assam. It will work purposefully and\nexpeditiously for their early resolution.\n\nWhilst cooperating with the efforts of the Chief Election\nCommissioner, to carry out a detailed enumeration, leading to a\nproper revision and publication of electoral rolls, the party will\nsimultaneously continue to emphasise the need for adequate\nsafeguards so that the scrutiny of enumeration lists becomes\nmeaningful.\n\nMindful of the national commitment of bonafide refugees in\nthe region, the BJP will work continuously to protect their interests.\n\nIn addition, the BJP will take all effective steps to prevent\nfurther illegal immigration. For this purpose it will work towards\njoint, cooperative effort by all the concerned adjoining states like\nTripura, West Bengal and Bihar.\n\nAt the heart of the continued impasse in Assam is the alienation\nof a whole section of our countrymen, resulting in the citizens of\nthat state being deprived of their right to participate in current\nelections. The BJP will immediately resume the process of negotiation\nand reconciliation so that the many problems of the region can be\ntackled with the wholehearted participation of the citizens.\n\nPunjab\n\n\u2018The BJP shares the agony of Punjab with the Punjabis.

As\na result, for four long agonising years, the State has been subject\nto an orgy of murder and mayhem. The tragic murder of Prime\nMinister Mrs Gandhi, and the bastial carnage which followed in\nits wake, also, are poison-fruits of Government's Punjab policy.\nThe BJP wishes to declare unequivocally that the nation shall\nnot allow another assault on the country\u2019s integrity, and that there\ncan be no compromise with those who talk of Khalistan. At the\nsame time, the BJP will not suffer any harm being done to innocent\npeople, Hindu or Sikh.\n1. The Punjab problem is basically political and we will solve\nit politically;\n2. Separatism and terrorism will be sternly dealt with;\n3. We will adequately compensate the sufferers of violence\nduring the last three years;\n4. The BJP will refer territorial claims and counterclaims river\nwaters and other outstanding issues, to the Chief Justice\nof India, for arbitration within one year.\n\nLaw & Order\nThe BJP views with alarm the rise of social violence in the\ncountry.

Whenever\nthere is a serious eruption of violence\n1. There must be a judicial inquiry;\n2. The inquiry report must be published;\n3. The Report recommendations must be implemented;\n4. Men guilty of incitement to violence or dereliction of duty\nwill be punished;\n5. All riot sufferers must be suitably and adequately\ncompensated and rehabilitated;\n6. We will conduct in-depth socio-economic studies of prone\nareas to take effective steps for riot-prevention.\nThe Police & The People\nThe Police is a vital organ of the State.

More and more millions are falling below the Poverty\nLine everywhere. Last year alone the Public Sector lost Rs. 6,000\ncrores (Rupees Six thousand crores) only.\n\nThe BJP will reverse all these ugly trend, and give the country\na humane economy. It will take all steps necessary to achieve full\nemployment, maximise production, stabilise prices and pull more\nand more millions above the Poverty Line, until nobody is left\npoor in the country.\n\nAgriculture\nAgriculture is our biggest industry.

We believe that the last Supreme Court judgement has\ngiven grounds for a great deal of disaffection. We would, therefore,\ntake steps to ensure that:\n\n1.

The Centre is a\nnon-profit, non-partisan independent institution dedicated to ethical and high-quality scholarship on all aspects and\nprocesses that shape life in India. Through different verticals of research, the Centre engages in questions of economic\npolicy, state capacity and governance, law and state regulation and domestic and international politics.\n\nThe Politics Initiative, set up in 2019, focuses its research on the changing competitive political party system, political and\nlegislative institutions, ideological worldview and preferences of political actors, voting behaviour, and incentive structures\nand choices that shape policy decisions. In engaging with questions, the initiative aims to become a pre-eminent hub of\nempirically rigorous, theoretically rich, historically-informed political research that shapes the discussions on key policy\nissues in the country.\n\ntt Hed\nPOLICY\n\nRESEARCH\n\n \n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\nDo political parties in India converge or diverge on the issues that matter to our democracy? The importance of this\nquestion lies in not only understanding how parties frame core issues but also in the competitive nature of Indian\ndemocracy and its future trajectory. This India Manifestos Project analyses Lok Sabha election manifestos from 1952\nto 2019 of three ideologically different parties \u2014 the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Indian National Congress, and the\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist).\n\nThe genesis of the India Manifesto Project lay in discussions with Pradeep Chhibber while working on our book\nIdeology and Identity: The Changing Party System of India (2018) \u2014 which maps out the ideological competition in Indian\npolitics over the zoth century. In 2018, | collaborated with Pranav Gupta to collect the manifestos of Indian parties,\nbut we soon realized that our hopes of replicating the Comparative Manifesto Project (https://manifesto-\nproject.wzb.eu/) database were too ambitious. The Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP), has been mapping\nmanifestos of all major parties in Western Europe since 1945, and the database has been expanding ever since.\n\nLocating pre-1990s manifestos of all parties was an arduous task. So, we limited our efforts to focus on three major\npolitical formations on India\u2019s ideological spectrum and only collected their Lok Sabha election manifestos.\n\nThe initial idea was simply to collect all the manifestos since 1952, code them and see how different parties prioritize\ndifferent issues over time. It was after we collected and perused the manifestos that we came to appreciate the\ncomplexity of the project we'd undertaken. Since the manifestos had evolved over time a simple categorization\nwould not have resulted in much.\n\nOur initial efforts were generously supported by the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung (RLS, South Asia) in 2020 to enable us\nto spearhead this project. However, COVID-19 resulted in a long break in our work, as we were unable to visit party\noffices, archives and libraries to trace these manifestos. Despite that, we managed to collect a handful of manifestos,\nto begin with, and created a rule book to code these manifestos. This was necessary because the already existing CMP\ncodebook was not suitable for issues that political parties in India have been focusing on. We also managed to pilot-\ntest our codebook on these manifestos and conducted inter-coder reliability tests to ensure that our database is free\nfrom particular researchers\u2019 interpretations of sentences within these manifestos. | am greatly indebted to\nintellectual inputs and feedback received from Pranav Gupta, who not only helped us gain clarity but also helped us\nsource difficult-to-get manifestos from early elections.\n\nIn 2021, the State Capacity Initiative at CPR generously supported this effort. I\u2019m thankful to Yamini Aiyar and\nMekhala Krishnamurthy for extending all their support to the India Manifesto Project. This report would not have\nbeen possible without their encouragement and guidance.\n\nI\u2019m also humbled by the efforts put in by researchers at the Politics Initiative at CPR in the last two years to take this\nproject to its logical conclusion. I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to Ankita Barthwal, llika Trivedi, Jatin Rajani,\nMelvin Kunjumon, Niyati Singh, Vaibhav Parik, Satyam Shukla, Nishant Ranjan, Shamik Vatsa and Talha Rashid.\nFinally, I\u2019'd like to thank the library staff at CPR for their help in providing the necessary help, Anushree Kaushal for\ncarefully editing this report, Sutanu Guru for helping out with the executive summary and Gurman Bhatia for the\nexcellent visuals.\n\nWhile these individuals may not agree with all the findings and arguments of this report, I\u2019m deeply indebted to each\none of them for their help. In the end, the remaining errors are mine alone.\n\nRahul Verma\nFellow, The Politics Initiative\nCentre for Policy Research\n\f\nCt\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\n1\n\nDo manifestos of political parties play any meaningful role before, during and after elections? Are they powerful symbols of\nthe ideas, vision and programmes offered by a party to citizens or are they merely symbolic? Since most voters don\u2019t bother\nto read manifestos before casting their ballot, why not relegate manifestos to the dustbins of oblivion? Despite such\nquestions raised every now and then by sceptics and cynics, manifestos remain significant to parties in articulating her\nfuture plan, course of action on key issues and ideological vision.\n\nGlobally, scholars have treated party manifestos as serious documents that clearly spell out the ideological vision and\naction plan of a party. The Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP) is a collaborative global exercise that converts promises\nmade by rival parties in various countries of the world into statistically measurable and comparable parameters.\nUnfortunately, Asian and African countries are largely missing from this exercise. Furthermore, the CMP methodology may\nnot work fora diverse country like India, with a proliferation of political parties whose ideological visions are always not\nvery clear. In this context, the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) devised a study protocol that maps out the Lok Sabha\nelection manifestos of the Congress, the BJP and the CPI(M ) since 1952. These three parties represent the ideological\nspectrum of Indian politics, and the study maps the evolution of issues that matter to Indian democracy.\n\nThe study involved a large team of independent coders and researchers using \u201cword count\"-- the number of words devoted\nto an issue in the manifesto -- to arrive at statistically measurable parameters. Seven major issues (or domains) were\nidentified for the purpose: national security, political competence, political systems, social fabric, economic planning,\nwelfare and development & infrastructure.\n\nThe results of this ambitious exercise are truly fascinating and offer a wealth of data as well as ideas to politicians, scholars,\nand journalists to dig deeper into specific issues confronting India that have attracted the attention of the major political\nparties. The study of manifestos from 1952 also offers a ringside view of how deeply and structurally the polity, economy\nand society have changed since India\u2019s first elections. Manifestos may be forgotten, but they have left behind lasting\nhistorical footprints.\n\nThose interested can delve deeper into the wealth of data thrown up by this study. For the sake of brevity, here are just a\nhandful of interesting highlights:\n\u00a2 Economic Planning, Welfare, and Development & Infrastructure have received a lot of attention in all manifestos of all\nthree political formations. Together, these three domains account for 55% of the total words written in the manifestos.\nThe context, however, has changed over the decades. The first four decades emphasised socialist models of economic\nplanning with the BJP being the lone advocate of the private sector. The economic liberalisation in 1991 changed the\nnature of issues in this segment across manifestos.\n\u00a2 Despite the rhetoric proposed by all parties of being committed to rural India, the percentage of words devoted to rural\ndevelopment within the development & infrastructure domain has fallen precipitously from 42% in 1952 to 5.6% in\n2019.\n\u00a2 The BJP continues to put a lot of emphasis on physical infrastructure in this century. Similarly, it has been emphasizing\nnational security, start-ups and self-reliance more significantly.\n\u00a2 The Left continues to emphasise anti-imperialistic or \u201canti-American\u2019 themes. It also gives a lot of space to labour rights\nand agriculture.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n\u00a2 When it comes to foreign policy and national security, internationalism, external influence and foreign special\nrelations dominated the discourse for the first four decades. The Congress's emphasis was on internationalism while\nthe CPI(M) focused on foreign special relations; in support of China/Soviet Union and opposed to the US. The BJP\nmanifestos paid much more attention to the military during this period. Since the 1980s, with terrorism becoming\nmore common, the BJP has dramatically increased its focus on internal security and terrorism. The INC and CPI(M)\nhave not been as consistent in their focus on these two issues.\n\n\u00a2 Over the decades, the focus of parties shifted, with the changing national and international conditions. As mentioned\nearlier, terrorism never found a place in manifestos until the 1980s, but it has become an important issue since then.\nSimilarly, while economic planning and state intervention received a lot of attention in the first four decades, any issue\nrelated to free markets or economic liberalisation received barely any attention. That has changed dramatically since\n1991.\n\n\u00a2 Changing realities have also led to a new discourse. Environment and sustainability have become important issues\nsince the 1980s. The first few decades did not see much attention paid to \u201curban\u201d issues as India was overwhelmingly\nrural. But with increased urbanisation leading to a big chunk of voters living in urban clusters, urban issues now receive\nalot more attention.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\nAs intermediaries between the government and the governed, political parties are the representatives of citizens in\nmodern democracies (Satori 1976). Simply put, \u201cwhen parties fail, linkage fails\u201d (Lawson and Merk! 1988). Parties\ncommunicate with citizens through different means, such as face-to-face campaigns or mass media, and in doing so, they\neducate the electorate on their policies and promises, offer programmatic alternatives to choose from, and engage in\ncoalition building, among other things (Eder et al.2016; Rommele 2003). One important tool at their disposal in this process\nis election manifestos.\n\nThe Election Commission of India\u2019s Model Code of Conduct (2019) defines a manifesto as \u201ca published document\ncontaining a declaration of the ideology, intentions, views, policies and programmes of a political party\u201d. The publication of\nparty manifestos is a statutory requirement in India. They offer an almost unparalleled insight into the party\u2019s ideological\nand policy positions and, therefore, can be understood as constituting the voice of the party. They serve not only asa\ncompendium of party positions to guide sophisticated voters and give inputs to journalists, but also\u2014and more\nimportantly\u2014as a directive and a handbook for party candidates and mobilisers themselves. It also serves as a contract\nwith the voters that can define the party\u2019s official stance when intra-party factions exist (Eder et al., 2017).\n\nManifestos have remained largely under-researched in the study of comparative politics in India. By analysing election\nmanifestos offered by different parties since 1950, this first-of-its-kind comprehensive study will enable academics,\nresearchers and policymakers to gain a richer understanding of the trajectories that party ideology and policies take\u2014and\ncould take\u2014in the future, the changing nature of party preferences while being resistant to change, and the impact this\nmay have on the nature of democracy, democratic values and parliamentary competition in the country. In doing so we\nseek to answer questions such as:\n\u00ab Howare parties matched with issues on a range of pan-national topics and the extent to which their positions differ\nfrom one another?\n\u00ab What are the chief ideological poles that emerge from the contest between parties and how has this ideological\nspectrum, in turn, impacted party competition?\n\u00a2 What is the relationship between promises and policy decisions and what factors are important in understanding elite\nresponsiveness to mass preferences?\n\nIn this report, we undertake a comprehensive overview of the content of manifestos of three political parties\u2014the Indian\nNational Congress (INC), the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), and the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI (M))\u2014covering\nthe ideological spectrum of Indian politics since 1952, and use content analysis methods, much like those used in the\nComparative Manifesto Project (CMP). This project has been undertaken to better understand the ideological subtext of\nthese documents. Illustratively, this will help in creating a comprehensive study of the party itself: identifying the issues\nthat parties continue to emphasise (salience), ideas that the party is inherently associated with (ownership) and their\ncommitment to these issues. The goal is to make intra-party comparisons to gauge the ideological gaps or similarities\nbetween them and the variations that have taken place in this over the decades. Such an exercise will allow us to place\nparty positions along the ideological continuum.\n\nIn India, it is customary for major political parties to release their manifestos in the public domain before an election. Most\nparties typically constitute separate committees for such a process. While there has been increasing media attention on the\ncontents of the manifestos, the dominant belief is that party manifestos do not matter at all. Given that few voters ever\nread them, such a disparaging view is understandable.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nHowever, as some scholars have argued, manifestos have many diverse uses. They can provide a crucial sense of clarity\nregarding a party\u2019s positions and help its candidates in conveying their vision to the electorate. They can also act as\ncampaigning guides and allow candidates to streamline their efforts to match that of the broader party line (Eder, et al,\n2017). These documents also signal shifts in party positions and allow for greater partisan sorting among supporters\n(Adams et al., 2014). On occasion, manifestos also further accountability on political parties by providing the public with\nenough information to compare performance with promises (Ashworth, 2000).\n\nLaver and Garry (2000) define manifestos as \u201cstrategic documents written by politically sophisticated party elites with\nmany different objectives in mind.\u201d Therefore, these documents are crucial tools in understanding the official stand of the\nparty on various issues of policy-making, concerns of the public and the general long-term agenda of the party for the\ndevelopment of a nation, if elected to power. Produced with a certain regularity, these documents are among the richest\nsources of information about a party\u2019s leanings, policies and programmes. They adopt a persuasive tone to sway the\nelectorate towards the party in question and away from the alternatives. An analysis of manifestos can illustrate changing\nnational sentiments and the response of political parties towards them. Manifestos are written both for an inward\naudience (for elected representatives and leaders) and the voter, navigating the needs and attention of both (Harmel et al,\n2016; Charlot, 1989). While the promises made within these documents are non-binding, manifestos can act as signalling\ndevices to contextualize the priorities of political parties projecting both an identity and an image (Harmel et al, 2016).\nThey present us with an effective method of studying political parties. They clarify party ideology and party position on\nissues of national significance, while also giving us a glimpse into relevant contemporary events and issues.\n\nResearchers have also used manifestos to understand campaign strategies\u2014which issues will be emphasized by the party\nand which will likely be blurred (Rovny, 2012). In an increasingly competitive election climate in India, where\nprofessionalized campaign management has become the norm, the nuanced strategies that can be derived from studying\nmanifestos deserve greater inspection.\n\nOther scholars have also used official party platforms to analyze the degree of policy adjustments induced by mimicking\nthe opposition (Adams, et al., 2009). Using data from the CMP, they found that parties tend to shift their policies in the\nsame direction as their opposition in the previous year, and also that the policy adjustments were more apparent in\nideologically similar parties. While government responsiveness to public opinion is fundamental to democratic functioning\n(Lijphart, 1984), the same has not been studied in-depth in India. This is because of the abiding idea that the country\u2019s\npolitics is clientelist and non-programmatic/non-ideological. The study of manifestos allows one to estimate party\nresponsiveness to programmatic and ideological preferences, thus creating a new framework with which to assess politics.\n\nThe ability to position political parties and politicians along an ideological spectrum\u2014most often the left-right one\u2014is an\nimportant element in comparative politics. In contrast to the clear ideological polarization between the United States of\nAmerica\u2019s Republican and Democratic parties, Indian politics has often been considered \u2018non-ideological.\u2019 This argument is\npredicated on exasperation caused by the behaviour of politicians and parties who shy away from taking distinct positions\non macroeconomic policy (Nooruddin, 2010; Suri, 2013). This lack of ideology translates into what is known as the\n\u2018persistent centrism\u2019 of India\u2019s political landscape (Rudolph & Rudolph 1987). The assertion, however, often belies the\ncomplexity of the identity and ideology of political actors in the context of our multi-party, post-colonial polity.\n\nIn 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) achieved the first single-party majority in the Lok Sabha in three decades. With\nthis, the dawn of India\u2019s Fourth Party System had begun, informing substantial changes in the form and substance of\npolitical competition. In addition, the ideological shifts currently underway caused by the 2014 election results have the\npotential to transform citizen-state relations and federal dynamics in the coming years. This paradigmatic shift, amidst\nwhat was seen as a polarising election (Vaishnav, 2015), prompts the need to study the ideological variations across parties\nto understand both changing contexts and electorate preferences and biases, and the extent to which this is impacted by\nthe actions of political parties. With the proliferation of numerous parties, particularly based on social cleavages (Chhibber\net al, 2014; Heath 2005), the framework provided by Chhibber and Verma (2018) is helpful to understand the ideological\npositions parties take. 4.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\nA manifesto is a unique tool for political research since it is the direct voice of a political party. Statements by political\nleaders, actions taken behind closed doors, promises made to voters in political rallies, and even words said during a\n\nlegislative discussion in parliament can be altered, subjected to differences in interpretation, backtracked or denied at\na later stage. But commitments made in an electoral manifesto convey the legitimate concerns and views of a party.\nHow they aim to address these concerns, what their issues are with other parties and whom the political parties are\nprioritizing are all stated clearly and explicitly in a manifesto. It would not be an exaggeration to say that manifestos\nhave been understudies in social science research, at least as far as Indian politics is concerned.\n\nDrawing from the Comparative Manifesto Project framework, the India Manifesto Project, 2022, analyses the\nmanifestos of the Bhartiya Janata Party and its predecessor the Bhartiya Jana Sangha, the Indian National Congress,\nthe Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have been chosen for this study since they\nencompass the three primary ideological leanings\u2014the Right, the Centre and the Left. This project aims to\nunderstand how political parties have transitioned over time, and to achieve that, one may study the evolution of\ntheir ideology, social groups being targeted, national goals being prioritized, areas of criticism of other parties and\nvarious other issues that are all documented and highlighted in a manifesto.\n\nWhile researching a political party through manifestos, several avenues of research open up. First, the study of a party\nitself, i.e., how it has changed, the issues that have decreased in priority, and others that remain at the party\u2019s\nideological core consistently. Second, an inter-party comparison according to election years can provide a fair\ndescription of how national parties differ from each other. For example, studies have claimed that parties do not take\nextremely different positions over mutually important issues but select different areas of priority for themselves and\nfocus on those, without any need for a confrontation. Are such generalizations applicable in India?\n\nThird, the ideologies of Indian political parties have been very dynamic, with parties being extremely hard to place on\nthe traditional left-right political spectrum. A holistic study of manifestos can shine a better light on this gap. Finally,\nan issue-based analysis can be achieved through the study of manifestos. This data can be used for deeper topic-based\nresearch wherein the positional mapping of parties can be done for almost all issues of political concern.\n\nThe primary method applied to this study is textual content analysis. All manifestos were read thoroughly by\nindependent coders and the text was broken down into sentences and quasi-sentences according to a set of\npredefined domains and categories, all of which have different codes signifying a different category. A detailed and\nextensive code list has been prepared beforehand according to Indian peculiarities.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nSpecific guidelines have been provided in the standard code book to guide the independent coders about the\ncategorisation of statements and issues mentioned in the manifestos. We have divided manifestos into 7 domains and 41\nsubcategories. The domain names are:\n\n\u00a2 Political Competence (100)\n\n\u00a2 Political Systems (200)\n\n\u00a2 Development and Infrastructure (300)\n\ne Welfare (400)\n\n\u00a2 Social Fabric (500)\n\n\u00a2 Economic Planning (600)\n\n\u00a2 National Security (700)\n\nWe have provided the details of each domain and what they entail in the subsequent pages of this report. For example, the\ndomain Welfare, includes the following categories, with their respective codes in parentheses:\n\n\u00a2 Labour Rights (401)\n\n\u00a2 Agriculture (402)\n\n\u00a2 Food and PDS (403)\n\ne Health and Education (404)\n\n\u00a2 Welfare State Expansion (405)\n\n\u00ab Women (406)\n\ne Underprivileged Minorities (407)\n\nWhile we are drawing from the idea of the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP), our endeavour remains distinct. The CMP\nis an international collaborative initiative aimed at collecting and analyzing the manifestos of different political parties\nexisting across various countries. It has a standard code book, but its domains and categories weren't suited to Indian\npolitical conditions. Therefore, a codebook dedicated to the Indian political ecosystem was created.\n\nA major difference between the CMP and this project is that the former uses \u201csentences\u201d as the parameter of\nmeasurement, whereas this project will make use of \u201cthe word count\u201d as the main parameter of analysis. One complication\nthat may rise when using \u201cword count\u201d as the parameter of analysis is that manifestos can be more verbose about certain\nissues or topics in comparison to others. If there are 100 words written about the generic importance of Issue A, for\ninstance, and only 10 words are used to make a decisive statement about Issue B, then using the word count method might\nshow that the party prioritizes Issue A over Issue B, which may or may not be factually correct. Therefore, during coding, it is\nassumed that the entire manifesto of a party has been written by one person or a team of persons representing that\npolitical party and that their stance on issues is deliberate and meaningful. Given that manifestos are a dynamic\ncompetitive space wherein parties have to choose what they will focus on, and for which they might trade off on other\nissues of importance, this needs to be analyzed deeply. Therefore, we conducted an in-depth issue-based analysis to\nunderstand how the positions of political parties have changed, or remained static, over time, even when they aren\u2019t being\ncompared to the positions held by their competition.\n\nTo collect all official party manifestos that have existed since Independence, online and offline archives of the concerned\npolitical parties were accessed from various university and institutional libraries and online sources. All national election\nmanifestos of the three selected parties, beginning in 1952 until 2019, have been found, read and coded into domains and\ncategories.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nDifferent coders selected manifestos indiscriminately and at random, and coded them independently. All coders were\nprovided with a standardized codebook to ensure the accuracy of the data. Finally, to check the reproducibility of the data,\nthe difference between the results of coding done by independent coders was analyzed. In that analysis, the results\nachieved by different coders in terms of the percentage of words dedicated to each domain in the chosen manifestos were\ncompared. The maximum difference was 8% between different domains in two different manifestos, The majority of the\ndomains, however, didn\u2019t show a major difference, indicating that the standard of categorization and method of coding is\neffective. On average, we found high inter-coder reliability. The resulting data is, therefore, reliable and reproducible.\n\nSome of the categories that have been created in the codebook are inherently valence issues, such as \u2018Employment.\u2019 This\nmeans that all parties will always talk about increasing the level of employment in the country and criticize rising levels of\nunemployment. But their methods of reaching the same goal may be different or contrasting. Similarly, certain categories\nare inherently neutral, like the \u2018Free Market Economy.\u2019 This means that both criticism of and praise for this topic will be\nmarked under this category. A party against privatization and another for it will both be placed here. The \u2018Notes\u2019 section in\nthe datasheet kept a track of the varying positions of parties in each category for further issue-based analysis.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\nManifestos are a medium that parties have at their disposal to articulate their programmatic visions as well as intellectual\n\nand ideological positions. This section looks at the broader evolution of manifestos, both in terms of their length, as well as\nin the prioritisation of issues over time (specifically across various party systems).\n\nFigure 1 shows the total number of words in the manifestos of each political party over the years. As can be observed, the\nmanifestos of left parties were extremely lengthy in the 1950s and 1960s, hitting the 10-15,000 word mark at times.\nConversely, BJS manifestos were concise until the 1970s, but the lengths peaked in the 1980s and 1990s. With the B)P\u2019s\nformation in 1980, core issues regarding religion and the economy were emphasized, with their manifesto crossing 25,000\nwords in 1998. The Congress\u2019 trajectory is mostly an upward one, interestingly; their manifestos were the shortest when the\nparty came to power in the years post-1999.\n\nFIGURE 1\nHow long have manifestos been historically?\nWord count of manifestos for Lok Sabha elections by party (1952-2019)\n\nINC\n\nBJS/\n\nBJP\n10k\n\nLeft\n1952 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2019\n\nTrends in Manifestos\n\nComparing the importance of the many domains covered by the political parties, it becomes clear that Welfare and\nEconomic Planning hold the lion\u2019s share of the word count, with approximately 40% of all words in manifestos dedicated to\nthese domains by all political parties. Those are followed by Development and Infrastructure, which takes up over 15% of\nall the words.\n\nPolitical Systems and Political Competence together hold around 20% of the word count, mostly because they generally\ninclude criticism of other parties and praises for their own parties and their competence. National Security and Social Fabric\nget the least number of words overall (see Figure 2). This general trend seems to hold for all parties, but there isn\u2019t any\ndiscernible pattern apart from this.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nThe shift towards welfare\nWhich topics appeared how much in party manifestos for the Lok Sabha elections by ranking\n\n1952 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2019\n\nBhartiya Jana Sangha (BJS) / Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)\n\nNational\nSecurity\n\n \n\nPolitical Competence Political\nSystems\n\n \n\n1952 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nVariations in Manifestos Across Party Systems\n\nPolitical parties do have their own organisational life, but they are also nested in party systems. They are components, or\n\u2018parts,\u2019 of the larger system and, therefore, any changes in the system naturally affect the parts.\n\nThere is a scholarly consensus that the Indian party system has seen at least four transformations since its inception. During\nthe first party system (1952-67), the Congress was the dominant party winning both at the national level and in most states,\novershadowing other parties, giving rise to the name \u2018Congress system.\u2019 The next phase (1967-89) was marked by the\nemergence of opposition against Congress in several states, resulting in a polarisation of the party systems at the state\nlevel. While Congress continued to win nationally, the non-Congress opposition parties started winning more seats and\nvote shares in the states. The third phase (1989-2014) marked the beginning of the post-Congress polity\u2014a competitive\nmulti-party system in which Congress was no longer the dominant player nationally. The period also witnessed the\nformation of coalition governments at the national level, since no one party was ever able to win a majority on its own.\nState-based parties acquired a greater voice both within their states as well as at the national level during this time. The\ncurrent party system began with the formation of a single-party majority, that of the BJP, in 2014. With a consecutive\nvictory in 2019 and the party\u2019s increasing presence, it became clear that India had entered its second dominant party system\nphase, this time anchored around the BJP. Ideologically, the median seems to have shifted so far towards the right that\neven the opposition is either mute or coloured in its strategy and tactics.\n\nWe use this party system framework to understand how manifestos of Indian parties have evolved over time- how much\nimportance each party has given to certain domains and why. What is discernible is that over time, parties have started\ngiving greater importance to Welfare Development & Infrastructure (see Figure 3). Economic Planning has shown a\nconsistent decrease in importance, except when it comes to left parties. The same applies to Social Fabric, where, again, the\nleft remains the outlier. National Security, too, has plummeted across time and parties.\n\nWhen it comes to Political Systems, the importance given to the domain by the BJP has shrunk from 14% during the first-\nparty system to 10.5% currently, whereas that given by the Congress has increased from 4.3 % to 11.2% respectively. In the\ndomain of Political Competence, the attention given by left parties to the domain has drastically gone down, from 18.1%\nduring the first-party system to 5.1% currently; for INC, it increased during and after Indira and Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s respective\nregimes (14.7% and 15.5%) and fell (4.7%) when the party started losing its legitimacy after their defeat in the 2014\nelections. Interestingly, for the BJP, the importance of Political Competence has picked up in the current party system (8%)\nwith the rise of Narendra Modi.\n\nIn the first party system (1952-67) (see Figure 4), when the INC, under the leadership of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru was the\ndominant party, it showed a greater proclivity toward a socialist pattern of organizing its economy and development\nstrategies, which can be observed in the greater importance given to the domains of Economic Planning (25.1%) as well as\nDevelopment and Infrastructure (12.8%) compared to other parties. BJP\u2014then BJS\u2014gave greater importance to Welfare\n(22.6%), mostly in terms of expressing their vision of how education and health needed to be structured. Left parties, as the\nprincipal opposition, rooted in their ideology, gave greater importance to Political Systems (16.3%) and Political\nCompetence (18.1%).\n\n10.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nAll parties can be seen giving similar importance to both Economic Planning and Welfare in the second-party system (1967-\n89). Though INC maintained power, it faced strong opposition and went through multiple organizational crises. This could\nexplain why opposition parties also gave greater priority to Economic Planning and Welfare, just as much as the INC did.\nWhen it came to Political Competence and Political Systems, left parties were more vocal in expressing the importance\nthey delegated to these domains. The INC, compared to the previous party system, can be seen dedicating increased words\nto Political Competence (14.7%), which coincides with the rise of populism under Indira Gandhi.\n\nWe see marked departures in the third-party system (see Figure 4). Left parties can be seen giving increased importance to\nthe domains of Social Fabric, Welfare and Economic Planning. Watershed events in Indian politics\u2014like Mandal-Mandir-\nMarket\u2014took place during this time. Left parties giving greater importance to these domains can be read as characteristic\nof their ideological inclinations. INC can be seen giving greater importance to Political Competence, signalling their\nacknowledgement of the level of opposition they had faced. BJP gave greater importance to Development and\nInfrastructure (22.6%) in comparison to other parties.\n\nIn the current, fourth-party system, what can be seen is the greater importance BJP gives to National Security (10.4%),\nPolitical Competence (8%), and Development and Infrastructure (23.6%). The rise of Narendra Modi as a strongman and\nthe proponent of the Gujarat Model of development can be gleaned from the importance the party gives to these domains.\nThe INC and the Left, on the other hand, can be prioritizing Economic Planning and Political Systems. The Left continues to\ngive greater importance to Social Fabric (16.1%) as they consider themselves to be the principal ideological opposition to\nthe Hindu majoritarian ideology the BJP espouses.\n\n11.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nWelfare is the most popular across parties\n\nProportion of words used under each topic by different parties between 1952-2019 in manifestos\n\nfor Lok Sabha elections\n\nBJS/BJP\nWELFARE was given the DEVELOPMENT /\nmost space in BJP Manifestos INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n\nNeer)\nTlie Utell)\n\nAgriculture\n\nwas given the most space\nUtne cee\n\nHealth and Education\n\nUnderprivileged Minorities\nWelfare State Expansion\n\nLabour Rights\n\nEns\n\nDevelopment\n\nScience and\nTechnology\n\naired ial e-Lice\nSustainability\n\nRural Development\n\nINC\n\nHealth and Education\n\nAgriculture\n\nUnderprivileged Minorities\n\nMW lero Msl ttm => 4er-Tar lel)\n\n1] efolU mately\n\nFood and PDS.\n\nCPI/CPM\n\nPNeltev lc)\n\nLabour Rights\n\nHealth and Education\n\nUnderprivileged Minorities\nWelfare State Expansion\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n\nTale) Tuto g\n\nPhysical\nTaian t a\n\nScience and\nTechnology\n\nSustainability\n\nRural Development\n\nUrban Development\n\n \n\nSOCIAL\nFABRIC\n\nReligion Military\n\nWorld Peace and\nInternationalism\n\nSocial Fabric -\n\n \n\n   \n \n  \n\nExternal Influence\nTerrorism\n\nemcee\nand Uni\n\n7\n\n \n\noldie\nForeign Special Ww\nionshi \u00b0\nforay Relationship \u00a9 S\nQ ai\na i\nInternal o a\nSecurity a 2\nFreedom and 8 8\nHuman Rights J&K = 2\nG \u00b0o\na\no\na\n\nReligion Ea ay Foreign\neecureme Special\nRelationship\nWorld Peace\nand\n\nInternationalism\n\nle\nMilitary\nInternal\nFreedom and Security\n\nHuman Rights\nTor einer\n\nNational\nSecurity Goals\n\nSito er ean J&K\nurl Ext.

These aspects are captured most strongly by the domains of Political Systems and Political Competence.\nMost of these categories provide space for parties to counter each other. The categories under Political Competence are\nPersonal Competence and Party Competence. In this section, we first discuss political competence and then political\nsystems.\n\nPolitical Competence\n\nParty Competence and Personal Competence respectively capture the emphasis given to the credibility of the party and its\nleadership. Party Competence holds a substantial share of the space given ina political party\u2019s manifesto (see Figures 5A\nand 5B). In the years post-Independence, with Congress being in power, Jana Sangh's manifestos highlighted the lack of\nCongress policies, issues with planning, their socialist-leaning, external aggression faced by India and excess governmental\ncontrol. In the decades that followed, criticism of Indira Gandhi\u2019s totalitarian and undemocratic policies and the\nconsequent emergence of the Janata Party are all issues that fall under this category. The statements of political parties\nabout the political climate and leadership of that time can be found in detail within these categories. These categories also\ninclude popular issues in an election year or all generic self-appreciation.\n\nThe analysis reveals that Congress has predominantly focused on its own achievements and prominent decisions taken by\nthe party leadership. The contributions of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi have all\nbeen highlighted. In the years when they were in the opposition, Congress\u2019 criticism of other parties was based on\nsituational issues as well as a lack of stability and secularism.\n\nFor the Left, the opposition is more principled and directed against the policies followed by Congress and the BJP, which\nwould include corruption, crony capitalism and foreign policy stances, particularly those with respect to the United States.\nHowever, there are other ideological drivers as well, which include communalism, misuse of preventive detention laws and\nprotection of minority rights. In terms of highlighting their own competence, the left parties lay emphasis on praising the\nsuccess of the state governments run by them.\n\nFIGURE 5A / POLITICAL COMPETENCE\nParties now spend less of the manifesto talking of political\ncompetence\n\nPercentage of Lok Sabha election manifestos dedicated to political competence (1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP INC CPI/CPM\n30% of\nmanifesto\n20%\nw oS 1p}\n1 I I I 1 I\n1952 2019 1952 2019 1952 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nFIGURE 5B / POLITICAL COMPETENCE\nIncumbent elections see a spike in the mention of party competence\n\nPercentage of content on political competence in Lok Sabha election manifestos used for different topics\n(1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP CPI/CPM\n100% of political\nJ competence\nParty 50%\nCompetence\n1 I\n1952 2019\nPersonal 50%\nCompetence l [l\n1952 2019 1952 2019 1952 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\nPolitical System\n\nThe categories under Political Systems are Governmental and Administrative Efficiency, Political Corruption, Judiciary,\nFederalism, Law and Order, and Democracy. Figure 6A provides space given by political parties to this domain in their\nmanifestos over time. We discuss each of these categories in detail below.\n\nGovernmental and Administrative Efficiency and Political Corruption\n\nUnder the domain of Political Systems is the category of Governmental and Administrative Efficiency which discusses\ntopics like good governance, the economy in administration, adoption of new technologies, digitization, e-governance,\nbetter accountability, transparency and reform of civil services and the legislative system. The category of Political\nCorruption captures discourses on corruption as well as allegations and instances of corruption that are meted out against\npolitical rivals. For the BJP, it is the importance attributed to Governmental and Administrative Efficiency and Corruption\nthat is worth underscoring. Even though the word share is not constant, it remains significant enough to be discussed in\nevery manifesto. BJP has adopted the guiding principle of \u201cminimum government and maximum governance\u201d in recent\nyears and has also suggested lateral entry into government positions as well as Constitutional reforms, further proving that\nthese issues are important to them.\n\nWhen it comes to the other parties, things look slightly different. For Congress, efficiency has occupied at least 20% of the\nwords in its domain across time, while the word share for corruption keeps changing\u2014it was not mentioned in 2009, was\n27% in 2014 and merely 2% in 2019 (see Figure 6B). On the other hand, Efficiency is not a major focus for the Left but it was\nemphasised in 2014 and 2019. Corruption, however, is the second most important category for the Left, with over 25% of\nthe domain\u2019s word share dedicated to it since 1996 (see Figure 6B). Issues like the Right to Information, implementation of\nLokpal, whistle-blower protection, black money, vigilance, anti-corruption mechanisms, criminalization of politics and\ncorrupt electoral practices are discussed in this category, along with mentions of any scams that have been brought to light\nin the past, like the 2G scam.\n\n15.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\nLaw and Order\n\nLaw and Order discuss police and domestic criminal activity and how it can be tackled better through reform and\nprocedural improvement. All opinions about methods of getting justice and dealing with specific crimes, like drugs, are\ndiscussed here. As far as the emphasis on it goes, it is the BJP which consistently highlights things within this category,\nwhile the Congress and the Left do not focus on it as much.\n\nDemocracy\n\nAs far as the idea of Democracy is concerned, all parties seem to place a significant emphasis on it in their manifestos. The\nBJP, for instance, have consistently spent at least 20% of its domain\u2019s word share in this category, that number peaked in\n1977, with around 61% spent on the category (see Figure 6B). Since then, however, that number has consistently decreased\nand become practically non-existent in recent years. BJP\u2019s proposed reforms include simultaneous elections, electronic\nvoting, company funding, increased voter participation like postal ballots for citizens living abroad, elimination of criminals\nfrom politics and a single voter list. The 1984 manifesto discussed four evils that were threatening to subvert the freedom\nand fairness of elections\u2014money power, ministerial power, media power and muscle power. Democracy, for BJP, has been\nsynonymous with equal importance to rights and duties.\n\nUnder the umbrella of democracy, Congress has continuously proposed a comprehensive electoral reforms bill with a\nstrong anti-defection law. Their manifestos in 2014 and 2019 dedicated 2.3% and 22% word share respectively to\ndemocracy (see Figure 6B), within which the proposed electoral reforms included the scrapping of the Electoral Bond\nScheme, setting up a National Election Fund and ensuring that EVMs and VVPATs are tamper-proof. For the left parties, the\nshare has been very consistent. CPM has proposed electoral reforms like scrapping electoral bonds, placing a ceiling on\nelection expenditure, state funding of elections, prohibition of corporate funding, reform of the Election Commission,\nreducing criminalization and introducing proportional representation. Statements about increasing authoritarianism and\nindependence of institutions are also tackled under this category.\n\nJudiciary\n\nJudiciary as a category captures judicial reforms\u2014especially concerning the appointment of judges through the National\nJudicial Appointments Commission\u2014fast-tracking cases, establishing special courts, accessible and speedy justice,\nrectifying judicial delays, legal aid, better judicial infrastructure, reform of the criminal justice system, alternate dispute\nredressal mechanisms, separation from the executive and overall independence of the justice system. The BJP has\ndiscussed this with the highest overall word share. While B)P\u2019s focus on the Judiciary has declined in recent years, with 7%\nwords about it in its 2019 manifesto, Congress has increased its emphasis on the subject in the last four elections. Left\nparties have constantly given it about 5-8% of the word share since 1998 (see Figure 6B).\n\nFIGURE 6A / POLITICAL SYSTEMS\nPolitical systems are not a significant part of the manifesto\n\nPercentage of Lok Sabha election manifestos dedicated to political systems (1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP INC CPI/CPM\n30% of\nmanifesto\n20%\nI I I I I I\n1952 2019 1952 2019 1952 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n16.\n\f\nCt\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nFederalism\n\nFederalism as a category encompasses topics of centre-state relations, rural-local government and inter-state relations. Centre-state\nrelations include support for federalism through the devolution of political and/or economic power from the centre to the states.\nImproved centre-state relations, increased autonomy for any sub-national level in policymaking and greater fiscal devolution to the\nstates are important themes here. State-specific concerns and issues are also coded under this category. Historically, the BJP has changed\nits stance drastically over the years\u2014from the Jana Sangh supporting a unitary form of government in the years post-Independence to\nthe BJP\u2019s current stance of ensuring strong state governments. Implementing the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission, such as\nappointing state governors in consultation with state governments, stopping the misuse of Article 356 and creating newer states, has\nbeen highlighted by the BJP. Meanwhile, Congress and the CPI have clearly supported the creation of states on the basis of language.\nCPM has stated its intention to keep the federal nature of the Indian constitution intact and has detailed steps in its manifestos to ensure\nthe same (Figure 6B).\n\nJana Sangh has discussed the evolution of elected Panchayats since 1952 and ensuring their self-reliance has been a priority for the BJP. In\nfact, the BJP has often cited the Vedic times as the root of the Panchayat system. Though the INC has dedicated the maximum number of\nwords to this category, it began primarily in1989. The granting of constitutional status to Panchayati Raj institutions has been discussed\nby them in extreme detail over the years to show Congress\u2019 commitment and contribution to strengthening the local self-government\nsystem in India. The role of Rajiv Gandhi and PV Narsimha Rao has been highlighted numerous times in this regard. Both parties have\nalso discussed strengthening the institution of Gram Sabha for people\u2019s participation. The Left, on the other hand, has kept its focus on\ngranting autonomy to tribal areas and attaining \u201cgenuine\u201d decentralisation, which has not been fulfilled so far.\n\nFIGURE 6B / POLITICAL SYSTEMS\n\nManifestos in the world\u2019s biggest democracy, hardly talk about democracy\nPercentage of content on political systems in Lok Sabha election manifestos used for different topics\n(1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP INC CPI/CPM\n100% of political\n\nsystems\nDemocracy re 50%\n1\n\n1952 2019\n\n100%\n\nGovernment 50%\nAdministration i, eli iba\nand Efficiency ainda\nJudiciary 50%\n\neee tl\n\nThe judiciary, law and order are not a\nsignificant part of any party\u2019s manifesto\nLaw and Order 50%\n\n \n\nPolitical 50%\n\n1952 2019 1952 2019 1952 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n17.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\nDevelopment is unarguably the most important domain when analysing the manifestos of Indian political parties,\n\noccupying significant space across the board. It includes the positive interventions that political parties promise to\nundertake for the betterment of the country and to raise the standard of living of its people. Development is a\ncomprehensive domain which comprises a number of varied categories, all tackling issues of importance concerning the\nday-to-day lives of common people as well as infrastructural aspects of the country that would enhance it as a whole.\n\nFigure 7A below shows the overall space allocated to development and infrastructure in a party\u2019s manifesto. As evident, the\nBJP and Congress allocated up to 30% of their space to this domain at their respective peaks. For most of the timeline, both\nparties allocated a significant space to development and infrastructure unlike the Left parties, whose allocation never\ncrosses the 10% mark. The categories subsequently mentioned in this section from the part of this domain, and the\naccompanying visualisations reflect the proportion of space taken by the categories in the domain of development.\n\nFIGURE 7A / DEVELOPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nDevelopment and infrastructure gain more space\n\nPercentage of Lok Sabha election manifestos dedicated to development and infrastructure (1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP INC CPI/CPM\n30% of\nmanifesto\n20%\n10%\n1 I !

Political parties often talk\nabout broad development ideas without any sector-specific goals or policies, all of which are included in this category. Aims\nto reduce poverty and inequality, for instance, or the management of the country\u2019s population are common topics of\nconcern in this category.\n\nThe BJP has consistently emphasised its aim of reducing inequality and destitution and the need to provide people with the\nbasic necessities of life like food, shelter and clothing. Distributive justice is a major theme here. Since the late 1970s, family\nplanning and welfare through non-coercive methods have been discussed in the context of population control and\nstabilisation towards the larger aim of sustainable development. On average, 23% of the word share of this domain is\nusually allotted to this category by the BJP (see Figure 7B).\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nFIGURE 7B / DEVELOPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nBJP sells on physical infrastructure, INC on sustainability\n\nPercentage of development and infrastructure content in Lok Sabha election manifestos used for\ndifferent topics (1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP INC CPI/CPM\n100% of\ndevelopment and\ninfrastructure\nDevelopment Pinte, 50%\n!\n1952 2019\nEnvironment and 50%\n\nSustainability nla M1\n\nIn 2019, when BJP mentioned development,\nnearly half was about physical\n\ninfrastructure\n| antl -\n\nRural development is not mentioned\n\nmuch by all three parties\nRural 50%\nDevelopm\nent\n\n  \n    \n \n\n100%\n\nPhysical\nInfrastructure\n\nScience and 50%\nUrban 50%\nDevelopm\nent\n| I I\n1952 2019 1952 2019 1952 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\nCongress talks about economic equality and social justice. The establishment of a \u2018Socialist Cooperative Commonwealth\u2019\nwas their goal in the initial decades post-Independence. The INC considered socialism as the best route to achieve its\ndevelopmental goals, both in the economic and social context. The Congress also discussed the importance of Non-\nGovernmental Organisations to support the welfare initiatives of the government in implementation. Poverty alleviation\nhas been a major pillar of the Congress\u2019 development agenda while stabilising the population is considered to be equally\nimportant, according to its (1999 manifesto).\n\nThe word share for this category has steadily declined for the CPM and the Congress since 1996 and 1999 respectively. This\ncan possibly be explained by the fact that instead of talking about development in general terms, these parties have now\nidentified specific sectors and policies that they focus on. Reduction of poverty and inequality remains their overall focus.\n\nWhen political parties concentrate on expanding developmental work in a particular sub-national region or state, that\nwork falls under this category. It is a minor category going by the word share, but there are specific regions that are\ncontinuously emphasised for developmental work. Improving the infrastructure, connectivity and security in north-east\nIndia, for instance, is highlighted and discussed in all manifestos post-1990s.\n\nThe BJP has mentioned the development of island groups, hills and desert regions, as well as its union territories in its\nmanifestos since 2004. The Congress discussed the upliftment of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in 1999 and 2004. However, the\ndevelopment of northeast India remains common across all parties.\n\nRural and Urban Development\n\nRural Development is a comprehensive category which includes social and economic modernization of villages, improving\ninfrastructure (including the agriculture sector) and provision of essential goods and services. The development of\ncooperatives and small village-based industries is also included here. The BJP has consistently mentioned the need for rural\ndevelopment, with 16% of the word share given to this category on average; however, since 2009, the number of words\ndedicated by the BJP to this category has been minimal (see Figure 7B). Despite this, the BJP discussed the goal of achieving\nGram Swaraj in 2019. Neither the INC nor the Left prioritise rural development much. Congress also brings up better\ngovernance at the local level, while CPM mentions small industries.\n\nUrban Development is usually discussed in the context of urbanisation, slum redevelopment, city amenities like public\ntransport and better municipal governance. While not as important before 2004, political parties have since started\ndiscussing it. The BJP also discusses the development of global and smart cities through the adoption of the latest\ntechnologies. The development of urban areas to minimise migration has also been highlighted by them. The CPM\nmentions the protection of vulnerable groups like street vendors and migrant labour.\n\nPhysical Infrastructure\n\nThis category includes improving the physical infrastructure of the country\u2014transportation, irrigation, the energy sector,\nwater management and large public works projects. This is a dominant category in this domain for the BJP, especially since\nthe late 1990s. Congress also focuses on this category, but its share of it is significantly lesser than the B)P\u2019s. Left parties\nhave dedicated around 19% of their words in this domain to this category on average (see Figure 7B), whereas the BJP and\nthe INC have dedicated 33% and 21% respectively.\n\n20.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\nTransportation is a major aspect here, with discussions around developing better roadways, connectivity through railways\n\nand necessary structures like bridges and ports. The development of heavy industries and concerns about the public sector\nare topics the Left focused on in this category.\n\nScience and technology\n\nCompared to earlier categories, Science and Technology is much more sector-specific. While its word share would indicate\nlittle emphasis historically, certain issues within this category, like networks, internet facilities and telecom, are becoming\nincreasingly important with each passing day and technological invention. This category has occupied 10-13% of all words\nin its domain for both the BJP and Congress in recent years. Improving communication and connectivity is the ultimate aim\nof any telecom policy. Strengthening its regulatory authority, improving public sector enterprises and creating better-\noperating conditions for private sector companies have been discussed by both parties.\n\nThe Janata Party discussed adopting \u201cappropriate technology\u201d in 1977 in order to promote self-reliance and local\ndevelopment of technology. Making India a software superpower through the IT industry and building a knowledge\neconomy was discussed in detail by the BJP in 2004. E-governance is a major area of focus since the last three national\nelections for both parties while making every household digitally literate is on the BJP\u2019s agenda. Left parties, however, have\nnot focused on this category in manifestos, but internet governance has been mentioned by them in recent years.\n\nDeveloping a proper national technology policy and inculcating a scientific attitude in people, investing in upcoming\nsectors and research, preventing brain drain and having a good Intellectual Property Rights framework are the major\nthemes. The Congress has discussed better research & development, scientific education and the use of technology in\nindustries like pharmaceuticals, atomic energy and biotechnology. Concentrating on indigenous technology, the autonomy\nof educational institutions and developing knowledge commons are important for the Left.\n\nEnvironmental Protection and Sustainability\n\nThis category includes policies for greenhouse gas emissions, adoption of methods of growth that align with\nenvironmental protection and better techniques of sustainable development. Green policies like the preservation of\nnatural resources and the protection of forests are a part of this category. Topics like ecological degradation,\ndesertification, protection of wildlife, pollution and deforestation are discussed. Protection of tribal rights and the creation\nof a formal national environment policy are also emphasised. This topic is usually nominally mentioned by all political\nparties.\n\nOn average, the BJP dedicates about 11% of the word share to this category (see Figure 7B). Though not important to it\nhistorically, Congress has given more attention to this category over the past three elections and has discussed specific\nsteps for environmental protection, like green budgeting and the creation of an independent authority to work on it. Left\nparties mention this category nominally, with some priority to water conservation, and, on average they have allocated\naround 12% of words in the domain to this category.\n\n21.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\nA large section of society continues to be either socially or economically backwards, or both. The provision of welfare,\n\ntherefore, forms a key component in manifestos. Since the state is responsible for helping these sections, political parties\nhave dedicated a sizeable portion of their manifestos to ideas and visions for the upliftment of the marginalised and the\nmitigation of social inequalities. Figure 8 shows that the space given to issues related to welfare has been consistently\nsubstantial across parties. The domain on welfare not only includes parties\u2019 positions on the welfare state at large but also\non sectors such as agriculture, health and education, as well as what they would aim to do for various social groups,\nincluding women, wage labourers and minorities groups.\n\nFIGURE 8A / WELFARE\nThe share of welfare in manifestos has been consistently increasing\nacross parties\n\nPercentage of Lok Sabha election manifestos dedicated to welfare (1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP INC CPI/CPM\n30% of\nmanifesto\n20%\n10%\n1 I !

All sectors\nthat have not been categorised separately are included in this section as well. All parties dedicate 5-10% of the word share\nto this category on average, prioritizing different aspects variably across years. Among them, the major issues are the public\nprovision of essential items (housing, for example), access to drinking water, sanitation and providing pensions to senior\ncitizens and persons with disabilities (see Figure 8B).\n\nJana Sangh, the predecessor to the BJP, initially proposed placing limits on the private incomes of individuals to ensure\nredistribution and equality. The Gandhian concept of Antyodaya and the B)P\u2019s now fundamental philosophy of Integral\nHumanism was discussed by the Janata Party as a way to assist the poorest of the poor. Topics like consumer protection,\njustice for the poor and improving social security through national identity cards were mentioned. The 1971 Congress\nmanifesto discusses the importance of implementing certain directive principles of state policy for the welfare of the\npeople and socioeconomic development. Welfare policies related to social assistance, like NREGA, are highlighted here.\nDirect Benefit Transfer and Aadhar were discussed by Congress in 2014 and Minimum Basic Income in 2019. For the Left,\nthe provision of electricity and establishing a system of subsidies are also important.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture represents a dominant category in the Welfare domain, with detailed descriptions of the policies and schemes\nto improve the agricultural sector. This can include irrigation, infrastructure, crop insurance, technology and education, and\nincentives to farmers like loan waivers and agricultural modernisation.\n\nAll political parties prioritise this category. The number of words given to it fluctuates when it comes to the INC and the BJP;\nin the 2019 BJP manifesto, it saw a major jump, with almost 30% of the words of this domain belonging to this category,\nwhich is three times more than it was in 2014. The Left, on the other hand, has shown a consistent increase in the word\nshare dedicated to this topic over the years.\n\nThis category also includes topics like land reforms, tenancy reforms and land ownership for a more equitable distribution\nof land resources. Predictably, left parties consistently talk about this aspect in every manifesto, while the BJP and Congress\ndo not discuss them with the same emphasis (see Figure 8B). There are many years in which the latter do not even mention\nland issues in their manifestos.\n\nFood and PDS\n\nDespite political parties often mentioning necessities like food, shelter and housing, food and the public distribution\nsystems (PDS) have not been emphasised as much by any of them when we look at the data.\n\nNeither BJP nor Congress has ever dedicated more than 5% of words from the Welfare domain to this category on average.\nTackling the shortage of food grains was a major issue of concern in 1967 when both the BJP and the Left discussed food\ndistribution. Ending hunger and malnourishment and having a corruption-free PDS are highlighted in this category as well.\nCongress has mentioned the National Food Security Act consistently since 2009. On the other hand, left-wing parties have\ndedicated 5-10% of the words to this category since 1996.\n\nLabour rights\n\nThis category includes topics like working conditions, changing demands and labour laws, facilities for workers (especially\nfor women and children) and changing industrial conditions.\n\nThis category is a major focus point for Left manifestos, with 15-20% of the word share of the Welfare domain given to this\ncategory for the last five national elections. This is in contrast to the BJP, which has had a very nominal focus on this topic\nfor the last two decades. The Congress can be said to have held a middle ground, with labour rights being mentioned in\nsome detail in some specific years.\n\nHealth and Education\n\nAs an important category in the Welfare domain, health and education are referred to as public goods, considered essential\nfor human resource development and whose supply is supposed to be the responsibility of the government. Political\nparties consistently dedicate a significant word share of the Development domain to health and education. The major\npriorities within these categories are similar for all political players.\n\nThe focus for all parties has been on universal primary education, scientific institutions of higher education, adult\neducation, ending illiteracy, vocational training, better working conditions and training of teachers. Education in regional\nlanguages was to be prioritised. Reducing gender inequality in access to education has also been an important issue for all\n\npolitical parties.\n23.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\nIn its initial days, the BJS, the predecessor of the BJP, advocated bringing Bharatiya culture into the educational system.\nThis was later carried forward by the BJP in their manifestos promising to include Indian culture, heritage and ethical\nvalues in the syllabi. The implementation of the Right to Education Act has been discussed by Congress. They want a total\noverhaul of the education system and vocation-oriented schooling, using the mother tongue as the medium of instruction\nand removal of colonial and elitist legacies. They are against Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in higher education.\n\nUnder healthcare, major themes include accessibility, better infrastructure, immunisation, nutrition, hygiene and\nsanitation. Integrating indigenous systems of medicine (AYUSH) is discussed by the BJP. The Left want not just increased\npublic expenditure but production from the government as well, like public sector pharmaceutical units.\n\nWomen\n\nWhen it comes to women\u2019s issues, the BJP has consistently dedicated a significant share of words to it, ranging from 10-\n20% in recent years (see Figure 8B). The BJS highlighted equal opportunities for women, including equal property rights,\neducation and training. Better provisions for working women are prioritised with encouragement for employment and\nentrepreneurship. The goal to root out the practice of dowry has been consistently specified since 1977. The aim is to\nstrengthen women as decision-makers, breadwinners and homemakers. The promise for reservation in elected bodies was\nstated in 1996 for the first time and has been repeated in every manifesto since then. The Uniform Civil Code to ensure\nequal rights for women of all religions has also been a priority for the BJP since 1996. Post-1996, detailed steps have been\nlisted to reduce violent crimes against women. Women-led development and providing healthcare for women for a\ndignified life were major themes in the 2019 manifesto.\n\nCongress has focused on removing social disabilities for women to ensure their full participation in the country. Equality in\nall spheres\u2014education, training and welfare\u2014is a priority as well. The reform of Hindu Law for women\u2019s rights was\nmentioned in 1957. Fighting social evils like dowry has consistently been on Congress\u2019 agenda. Schemes like Indira Mahila\nYojana, rural development projects and reservation in elected bodies are emphasised, along with the economic\nempowerment of women. The 2014 manifesto detailed measures to ensure the safety of women.\n\nLeft parties also champion gender equality in their manifestos. Though most aspects of their plans are the same as the\nother parties, they remain focused on equal rights and provisions for working women. The issue of crimes against women is\nalso important to them while aiming for social equality comes up in Left manifestos since the 1980s. The Left focuses a lot\non labour rights, and the rights of women labourers are discussed simultaneously in detail. The 2019 CPM manifesto also\nmentions issues such as criminalizing marital rape, enacting a stand-alone law against honour crimes and increasing\nallocations under gender budgeting.\n\nUnderprivileged minority groups\n\nThis is a broad category that comprises various topics such as children, youth, persons with disabilities, gender, sexual\nminorities and other underprivileged minority groups who don\u2019t fall under any other categories. The share of words each\nparty has dedicated to this category does not hold any conspicuous pattern and has varied over time, with the inclusion of\ntopics such as gender and sexual minorities (like the transgender community) in recent times.\n\nIn the initial years after Independence, the BJS made it a point to talk about displaced persons as a result of the partition of\nIndia, giving top priority to their rehabilitation and defining measures to help them financially. Supporting Hindus\nmigrating from Pakistan to India was a major feature of Jana Sangh\u2019s manifestos until 1967. It specifically stated that the\nparty believes in equal rights for all and does not recognize minorities based on religion. It simultaneously emphasizes its\nstance against discrimination and the policy of supporting backward classes through economic and educational\nopportunities. The establishment of a Minorities Commission was discussed by the Janata Party in their manifesto.\n\n24.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nFIGURE 8B / WELFARE\nAgriculture, health and education are popular across parties\n\nPercentage of welfare content in Lok Sabha election manifestos used for different topics (1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP CPI/CPM\n\n40% of welfare\nAgriculture 20%\n\n1 I\n1952 2019\n40%\nFood and PDS get very\n\nFood and PDS fia pen space [ipo 20%\n\n40%\nHealth and yy 20%\nEducation\n\nBJP has given less emphasis\non labour rights historically\n\nLabour 20%\nRights tlLesian] ~\n\n40%\n\nUnderprivileged 20%\nMinorities\n\n40%\n\nWelfare State 20%\nExpansion UL\u00bb im\n\nPromises towards the welfare\n\n40%\n\n40%\n\nof women have increased\nWomen i ~_ plbein a ee 20%\n\n1952 2019 1952 2019 1952 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n\n25.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nThe BJP specifically mentions the Sindhi community in1989 and 1991 and assures the protection of their identity and\nrepresentation. In their1996 manifesto, the BJP talks about the steps needed to be taken for the protection of Kashmiri\nPandits, Chakma refugees, Sri Lankan Tamil refugees as well as Non-Resident Indians in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Congress's 1952 manifesto also talks extensively about the rehabilitation of displaced persons from Pakistan. The 1996\nmanifesto clearly states that Congress recognizes the special disadvantages faced by minorities and prioritizes their\nwelfare through increased funds and better policies. The 2009 manifesto mentions Congress's pioneering reservation for\nminorities in specific states.\n\nLinguistic minority groups are often discussed by the INC and educational instruction in the mother tongue is a major\npromise for these communities, according to the 2019 manifest; so is the welfare of fisherfolk. Left parties discuss refugee\nrehabilitation and their gainful employment as well as provisions for linguistic minorities in the years post-Independence.\nUsually, the Left takes the generic stance of non-discrimination and upliftment of backward communities through welfare\nmeasures and reservations. The CPI has specifically mentioned rehabilitating people displaced because of developmental\nprojects in 1999. The CPM has discussed issues faced by fisherfolk in every manifesto since 1999.\n\nIssues concerning youth include involving them in the process of development and governance, increasing their\nopportunities for education, employment and skill development, and higher involvement in sports. The BJP mentions a\nNational Youth Policy and talks about the youth\u2019s societal contribution, instilling in them a sense of pride in India\u2019s culture\nand tradition as well as voluntary community service. The 2019 manifesto of the BJP discusses entrepreneurship and start-\nups and the participation of youth in governance. Congress has also maintained regularity on this issue but with a more\nfluctuating word share, especially because the 2019 manifesto did not consider this category at all. The Congress has\ndiscussed involving the youth in social reform, reducing drug abuse, lowering the voting age and utilising the natural\ndemographic dividend possessed by India. Congress manifestos also call being youthful and dynamic the hallmark of the\nparty, with promises to induct more youth into the party. Left-wing parties, on the other hand, have not focused much on\nyouth apart from the topics of student politics and employment. Similar to the BJP, the CPM has consistently mentioned\nthe goal to develop a National Youth Policy.\n\nCommon topics for all parties include child labour, primary education, universal healthcare with immunization and\nnutrition, protection of children and a better juvenile justice system. Special provisions for the girl child and other\nvulnerable children are also discussed. Children have been a category of focus for the Left since 2004, before which this\ngroup was not emphasised much.\n\nLeft-wing parties have dedicated the maximum number of words to this category overall among all parties. The BJP has not\nprioritised children over the years but the 1998 manifesto goes into detail about the basic rights that must be ensured for\nchildren. Congress does discuss children in some detail and mentions the establishment of the National Commission for\nProtection of Child Rights in 2006. But all-in-all, this category cannot be said to be a priority for any of these parties.\n\nAll parties have started discussing persons with disabilities and the LGBT community in recent years, especially post-2009,\nbut their word share is minimal. A rising focus on these groups shows that the parties have increased social awareness and\nare working towards more welfare initiatives for newer social groups that might've been ignored in the past.\n\nEmpowerment and development of persons with disabilities, better accessibility through infrastructure and providing\nthem with equal opportunities is the goal for all parties. Congress and the Left have mentioned their duty to protect the\nrights of the LGBT+ community, gender sensitivity training as well as correct the issues with the Transgender Bill 2014. The\nCPM has mentioned its support for the legal recognition of same-sex couples and a comprehensive anti-discriminatory bill\nto protect the community. The BJP has specifically mentioned giving opportunities to transgenders only through their\n\nsocio-economic empowerment.\n26.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\nWhen it comes to the social fabric of society, there is a greater distinction between the positions parties take compared to\nother domains. Issues of freedom, democracy and culture often make for strong signalling devices and capture a party\u2019s\nsocial and political ideology. Caste and social justice, religion and secularism, nationalism, cultural diversity and unity,\nfreedom, human rights and other Social Fabric issues are the important categories in this domain.\n\nWith major socio-cultural shifts over the course of independent India\u2019s history, this has become an important domain for\nanalysing a political party\u2019s stance on significant events. India is a combination of innumerable social groups which makes\nthis domain important to understand the views of various parties on maintaining diversity. Post-Independence, around\n20% of the words were dedicated to discussing the nation\u2019s social fabric in the manifestos of all parties. But over time, the\nshare of this domain has declined, falling to 8-10% in recent years (see Figure 9A). Moreover, while parties across the\nideological spectrum maintain their dedication to the secular principles of the Indian constitution, their mechanisms for\nensuring the same vary drastically.\n\nFIGURE 9A / SOCIAL FABRIC\nThe space given to the social fabric has stayed mostly consistent\nPercentage of Lok Sabha election manifestos dedicated to the social fabric (1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP INC CPI/CPM\n30% of\nmanifesto\n20%\n10%\nI I I I 1 I\n1952 2019 1952 2019 +1952 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n\nCultural diversity and unity\n\nThis category deals with favourable mentions of cultural diversity and plurality within the society and the preservation of\nthe autonomy of religious and linguistic heritages, including special educational provisions. This is a significant category for\nall parties, even though its importance has declined over the years in terms of word share. The theme of unity in diversity\nand non-discrimination is strong for all political parties.\n\nLanguages are the major concern in this domain. Protection of languages like Urdu, Sindhi, Manipuri and Nepali, retaining\nthe three-language formula and medium of instruction in regional languages are often the key points of focus. The Left, for\ninstance, consistently emphasises developing regional languages and opposes the forcible imposition of Hindi. On the\nother hand, Congress has more or less regularly discussed the issues in this category since the 1990s, while Jana Sangh was\n\nmore focused on this issue before the 1990s.\n27.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nHowever, the BJP and Congress did dedicate 22% and 14% of words in the domain respectively to this category in 2014 (see\nFigure 9B). The promotion of Hindi and Sanskrit is important for the BJP while being united despite all differences is\nimportant for the Congress.\n\nNationalism\n\nNationalism was a key point in the manifestos of the Congress and the Jana Sangh in the earlier elections of Indian\ndemocracy, with parties highlighting their idea of a country as well as their achievements during the struggle for\nindependence.\n\nCultural nationalism remains an important feature of right-leaning parties, exemplified by the BJS deriving their\nnationalism from Indian history and mythology, aimed at restoring lost glory. They have often depicted India as Bharat\nMata in multiple manifestos. By 1962, there was a reduction in the number of words for this category, given the relative\ncrystallisation of ideas about the nation compared to previous elections. The recent resurgence in this category has been\nseen primarily in 2009 and 2014 when the BJP traced the historical achievements of Indian civilization in their manifestos.\nInterestingly, nationalism and patriotism were not explicitly penned down in the 2019 BJP manifesto, although their\ncampaign focused on similar issues.\n\nThe Congress, on the other hand, draws heavily on the party\u2019s contribution to the freedom movement and nation-building\npost-Independence and Partition. It has often highlighted the legitimacy of the party in the context of its legacy. Though\nthis category is not a major point of focus, it is mentioned with respect to the role the INC played in the freedom movement\nand how Congress leadership has sacrificed their lives for India for decades, citing Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. The Left,\nhowever barely mentions nationalism.\n\nFreedom and human rights\n\nThe category of freedom and human rights includes upholding civil liberties, freedom from any form of repression and the\nidea of individualism. The Jana Sangh has discussed values like the rule of law, equality and preservation of civil liberties,\nand has criticised repression through laws related to preventive detention. Criticism of the violations of human rights\nduring the Emergency era forms a major part of this category for the Janata Party\u2014for instance, when the right to protest,\nand other fundamental rights, were denied to the public. Freedom and human rights have not been very important\ncategories for the BJP in recent years. They were mentioned until the late 1990s but have not been discussed since then.\n\nFreedom of the press and the creation of a statutory national-level human rights authority are issues of importance for all\npolitical parties. For Congress, 74% of this domain in the 1971 manifesto was about this category, which mainly discussed\nthe right to property (see Figure 9B). The topic is not discussed with much consistency in Congress manifestos, although\n26% of the word share in 2019 tackled topics like sedition, defamation, reform of preventive detention laws, prisons and\nprivacy concerns related to internet rights.\n\nLeft parties had given a dominant portion of the domain\u2019s words to this category until 1980; its importance declined\nsubsequently until 2004 when it picked up again. The key topics were mentioned police brutality and strict enforcement of\nfundamental rights, including the rights of workers. The CPM has discussed the negative consequences of the Emergency in\nextreme detail. Repealing draconian laws, like those of preventive detention, (AFSPA, for example) has been a major\nconcern throughout the years for the CPI and the CPM. Apart from these issues, concerns about Aadhar and the death\npenalty were also highlighted in 2019.\n\n28.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\nReligion\n\nAny mention of the protection of religious minorities and strengthening their rights with welfare schemes, special\nprovisions and budgetary allocations are included in this category. Independent minority educational institutions, religious\nfreedom, the establishment of a statutory authority to deal with minority issues and the promotion of Urdu are some\nimportant issues in this category. The rights of Muslims are the most crucial here.\n\nInitial Jana Sangh manifestos state that the party does not recognize minorities on the basis of religion, but the party also\nmentioned the protection of Hindu refugees from Pakistan. The BJP clearly stated its policy of \u2018justice for all, appeasement\nof none in its 1996 manifesto and promised action to support Kashmiri Pandits in 1998. Their 2019 manifesto stated their\nintention to extend the National Registration of Citizens to more states after Assam. The Congress has regularly\nhighlighted the importance of India\u2019s secular character, freezing the status of places of worship, a separate Ministry of\nMinority Affairs and creating a law against hate crimes and affirmative action.\n\nThis is the most important category in this domain, especially when it comes to political parties and their ideological\ndifferences. Though all parties firmly state their belief in equality among people of all religions in India, religious\ndifferences and opinions are frequently brought up along. Criticisms of other parties being communal are raised in\nmanifestos, especially against the BJP by Congress and the Left. As a result, this category dominates this domain for the\nlatter two, while the BJP has not dedicated a lot of space to this topic, especially since the 1990s. The Left has dedicated 40-\n50% of the word share of this domain to this category since 1984, both with respect to Congress and the BJP.\n\nFor Jana Sangh, the concept of Dharma Rajya is explained as a rule of law and not as a theocracy. They are clearly opposed to\nthe politics of Muslim appeasement, or \u201cpseudo-secularism,\u201d and aim to establish a completely secular nation based on\nBhartiya nationalism with equality for all. The Indian ideals of Sarvadharma Sambhava and Sarva Panth Samadara are\nimportant for them to ensure India\u2019s heritage of respecting the diversity of all forms. Establishing a Uniform Civil Code is an\nimportant aspect in this regard and has been mentioned in almost all manifestos since the 1990s. Their 2009 manifesto\ndiscussed the establishment of an inter-faith consultative mechanism for harmony and the issue of religious conversions.\n\nWhenever the INC discusses the secular character of the country, it is accompanied by their support of the duty of the state\nto protect religious minorities. The issue of Sikh communalism and the strong steps taken by Congress to maintain India\u2019s\nintegrity were discussed in detail during the 1980s. Secularism is one of the pillars of the modern Indian nation according to\nthe INC, and the efforts of Congress to preserve the same have been highlighted. The politicization of the Babri\nMasjid/Ram Janmabhoomi issue by other parties is discussed, and the Congress\u2019 stance is touted to be the best for the\nnation. The INC is opposed to the Uniform Civil Code unless the demand comes organically from communities themselves.\nEstablishing an Inter-Faith Council was stated in the INC 2019 manifesto as well.\n\nLeft parties have consistently stated their opposition to communal forces like the RSS, and they have repeatedly called out\nthe weaknesses in Congress\u2019 actions to tackle such divisive forces and Congress\u2019 alliances with these actors at different\npoints in time. The regressive communal menace of the BJP and its Hindutva agenda has been discussed the most by the\nLeft in this category. The Babri Masjid issue and instances of communal violence have been condemned in detail by the CPI\nand the CPM, and both left parties and Congress clearly support a judicial decision in the case of Ram Janmabhoomi. The\nCPM has also openly criticized the role of Congress in the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.\n\n29.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nHindutva or Hinduism is especially important for the BJP. Congress and Left parties have not discussed this issue in much\ndetail, except to criticize the B)P\u2019s policies. The Jana Sangh\u2019s emphasis on Bhartiya culture, nationalizing non-Hindu\ncultures, protection of cows through the prohibition of cow slaughter, promotion of Hindi and Sanskrit, resettling Hindu\nminorities from neighbouring countries, repealing anti-Hindu laws, protection of Ram Setu and Ganga, the autonomy of\ntemples and their clear intention to build the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya are all issues that are repeated often in this category.\nThe Congress and the, on the other hand, have rarely focused on this category, except for a few instances of declaring their\nsupport for a peaceful judicial decision or a negotiated settlement in the Ram Mandir issue. The 1998 Congress manifesto\ncriticized the exclusionary politics of the RSS and the BJP in extreme detail. The CPM has criticized the Congress\u2019\nopportunism as well and has always stated its clear intent to defeat communal forces in India.\n\nCaste\n\nCaste is one of the most dominant categories in the domain of Social Fabric. Economic and social empowerment through\nwelfare, special provisions and stricter laws are the priority under this category. The rights of tribals are discussed in detail\nas well, especially in the context of land and forest rights. Parties across the spectrum believe in social justice for the\nmarginalised sections of Indian society, even though their mechanisms for tackling this issue are different. Parties have\nconsistently dedicated a sizable share of words to talk about these topics.\n\nThe 1980s saw the subject of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), the Mandal Commission and reservations being supported by\nall parties. Left parties focus on this category most consistently, with over 30% of words rising since 2009, and a continuous\nfocus on the welfare of this group prior to that as well. The CPI supported the idea of extending reservation to the private\nsector in their1996 manifesto and reservation for Dalits of other religions in1999. Regional autonomy for tribal areas and\nrecognition of tribal languages has also been highlighted. The share was usually greater than this in the years prior to that.\n\nThe BJP has highlighted equality for all and the end of casteism and untouchability in the context of unity within Hindu\nsociety as well. The BJP has also supported reservations based on economic backwardness since 1991. The party has\nhighlighted its commitment to the two principles of social justice and social harmony in recent years. The BJS believed that\nindividuals deserve equality of opportunity and liberty on the basis of Bhartiya \u201cSanskriti\u201d and \u201cMaryada.\u201d Untouchability\nhas also been discussed in most BJP manifestos and the party has adopted a firm stance against the practice. The BJP\u2019s\nphilosophy of Integral Humanism aims to form a casteless socioeconomic order in India. However, in comparison to the\nCongress and the Left parties, the BJP has dedicated the least number of words to this category.\n\nThe Congress and the Left have adopted a similar stance on social justice, with the majority of their words dedicated to the\nsub-domain focusing on preventing atrocities against Dalits and other marginalised sections. Social justice features in the\nmajority of the manifestos of the Left and Congress; however, the number of words dedicated to it has reduced over the\nyears. Inthe 1971 INC manifesto, ending privy purses to princely states was considered a firm stance in ensuring social\njustice. In 2014 and 2019, the party vouched to ensure social justice by strengthening the Anti-Manual Scavenging Act of\n1993 and protecting street vendors. Left-wing parties believe that eradicating casteism is imperative for maintaining\nworking-class solidarity, as mentioned in the 1967 CPI manifesto.\n\nCulture and Morality\n\nOther themes from the Social Fabric domain comprise traditional morality, civic-mindedness, and topics such as media,\narts, sports and cinema. Traditional morality here specifically refers to prohibition and traditional family values, with the\nformer being a stated nationwide aim of the Jana Sangh in 1957. The BJP in their 1996 manifesto discussed Bhartiya culture\nand how it must be preserved through the monitoring of media and cinema and the promotion of Indian traditions. The\n\nimportance of family in Indian society was also discussed in 1998.\n30.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nFIGURE 9B / SOCIAL FABRIC\n\nWhen parties talk of the social facric in manifestos now, they\nmostly talk about caste and religion\n\nPercentage of social fabric content in Lok Sabha election manifestos used for different\ntopics (1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP INC CPI/CPM\n\n60% of social\n\nfabric\nCaste fur\" fille 30%\n\n1 1\n1952 2019\n60%\n\nCultural Diversity 30%\nend SL ee JUL\n\n60%\nFreedom and 30%\nHuman Rights\n\nBarring BJP\u2019s manifestos in 2009 and 2014,\nnationalism has not been a manifesto favourite in 60%\n\n. . recent years 5\nNationalism 1 a 30%\n\u2014o_O _\n\n60%\nReligion 30%\n1ot I\n\n1 I\n1952 2019 1952 2019 1952 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n\n31.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nOther parties have had mixed opinions on prohibition. Congress discussed the importance of moral values and the goal of\nprohibition only in 1957. The CPI, on the other hand, discusses the scrapping of prohibition laws in 1979 and the desire to\nbring about temperance through persuasion. It simultaneously wanted to resist ideological and cultural invasion which\nthreatened India\u2019s traditional values. The CPM discussed steps to counter decadent culture and stated its goal to encourage\nprogressive literature and art in 1980 to reduce increasing criminalization and degenerating moral values, like the\nglorification of violence and the commodification of women.\n\nAmong other things, Congress discussed the need for meaningful citizen engagement and civil society participation in\n2019. Apart from this, their manifestos do not have any specific appeals for unity for social change that are independent of\nother contexts. Congress proposed setting up a statutory National Commission for Heritage Sites in 2009. Art, culture,\nsports and media were a focus for them in 2019, with concerns like developing a code of conduct for reporting and curbing\nmonopolies in media. For the BJP, this category has been a major point of focus for almost throughout 1971. The promotion\nof the film industry with respect to its role in entertainment as well as national integration, implementation of the Prasar\nBharti Act, reviewing the Official Secrets Act, exemption of certain quality performances from entertainment tax, free press\nwith no governmental interference and promotion of traditional folk and tribal arts are some major concerns for the BJP.\n\nWhen it comes to sports, developing a National Sports Policy, promoting sports at all levels and putting India on the\nOlympic map are some of the main points. Sports have been highlighted specifically by the BJP in recent manifestos. Their\n2004 manifesto mentioned the goal of developing a National Policy for India\u2019s Entertainment Industry and a National\nMedia Policy. Left parties emphasize the free expression of India\u2019s cultural traditions, the promotion of progressive art and\nstrong autonomous organizations for free media.\n\n32.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\nOne of the clearest shifts in party positions across time is seen in the domain of Economic Planning. It is one of the most\nimportant domains based on manifestos as it has consistently been the one with the maximum number of words for all\nparties (see Figure 10A). This domain includes the following categories: economic goals, pro-state intervention (in the\neconomy); free market economy; price rise and inflation, and employment.\n\nWhile analysing the numerous categories mentioned above, we focus on the free market economy, pro-state intervention\nand economic goals, to understand the distinct positions of political parties and their contrasting viewpoints on important\neconomic issues. The remaining categories often comprise similar positions for all parties, such as the need to reduce\ninflation and increase employment.\n\nFIGURE 10A / ECONOMIC PLANNING\nBJP\u2019s emphasis on the economy is decreasing\n\nPercentage of Lok Sabha election manifestos dedicated to economic planning (1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP INC CPI/CPM\n30% of\nmanifesto\n20%\n10%\nI tol to I\n1952 2019 1952 2019 1952 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n\nEconomic goals\n\nThe category of Economic goals captures broad and generic economic goals as well as the need for raising the nation's\noverall economic growth vis-a-vis government measures that do not fall under any specific policy positions. Since 1984,\n\nthe BJP has mostly focused on this category within the Economy domain. Almost 40% of words were dedicated to\neconomic goals in the post-Emergency years. The Janata Party talked about the stagnation of the economy and\nreformulating planning based on the Gandhian values of Antyodaya, austerity and imbibing social justice within economic\npolicy. The goals of reduction of wealth and income inequality through simplified taxation and limits on income were\nimportant. Countering inflation, increasing employment and reducing poverty have been standard goals for the BJP\nthroughout. The BJP has called for autonomous monetary institutions and improving the balance of trade by regulating\nforeign trade to counter the fiscal deficit.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nThere has been a distinct shift in their last four manifestos, with the BJP aiming to transform India into a global\nsuperpower. They have consistently emphasised tax reforms, with promises for VAT and GST in recent years. Specific steps\nhave been discussed to turn India into a manufacturing hub and improve industries like coal, steel, textiles, tourism and the\nknowledge economy. Topics like fiscal discipline, corruption, Special Economic Zones and Self-Help Groups have been\ndiscussed. The 2014 and 2019 manifestos prioritize start-ups, ease of doing business, MSMEs, check on Non-Performing\nAssets, increasing Foreign Direct Investment and overall macroeconomic stability with policies like Direct Benefits\nTransfers, tax reform through GST, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and Make in India. The goal is to turn India into a USD\nfive trillion economies by 2025 and a USD 10 trillion Economy by 2032.\n\nThe goals of the Congress party have evolved significantly across elections and seem to respond to the socio-economic\ndemands of its time. Economic goals hold clear importance for Congress in this domain, with over 34% of the world's share\ndedicated to this (see Figure 10B). Immediately after Independence, the party focused on the development of agriculture.\nSoon after, in the 1960s, it started looking toward industrialization and the growth of the public sector. This set of goals\nremained largely unchanged until the early 1990s, wherein their socialism started giving way to liberalization. Regardless,\nthe guiding principle that motivates most of their economic goals is economic development combined with social justice.\n\nThe Congress\u2019s manifestos relied heavily on planning in the initial years post-Independence. During the 1980s and until\n1991, it provided vague goals and criticisms of other parties with few policy specifics but slowly started providing detailed\npolicies to enact its goals, which have been consistent from 1996 to 2019. Topics like tax reform (VAT, GST, Direct Tax Code),\nself-reliance, financial and banking sector reforms, foreign trade and investment, fiscal discipline, capital markets and even\nspecific industries like power, telecom, coal, etc. have been addressed in this category.\n\nFor the Left, the word share given to economic goals has always been overshadowed by another category in the domain.\nSomewhat similar to the Congress, they combine economic development with social justice, and their goals broadly focus\non the upliftment of depressed economic groups, like the working class, farmers and labourers. The main gripe with Left\nmanifestos is that they provide vague and broad goals without delving into specific policies that may help achieve those\ngoals. Moreover, their economic goals remained more or less unchanged between 1991 and 2019, going back and forth\nbetween increasing public investment, establishing minimum wages, regulating the inflow of foreign capital and\nmanaging foreign debt and taxation structure. In other words, the CPI(M) has continued to offer general solutions that do\nnot take into consideration or respond to the actual economic realities of the time.\n\nPro-state intervention\n\nAs the name suggests, the category takes into account the importance parties have given to the aspects and modes of direct\nintervention the state should make to enable a free and competitive market that is free of monopolies as well as state-\ndriven economic development.\n\nThe BJP maintained a balanced position with almost an equal word share for pro-state intervention and a free market\neconomy until the early 1980s. The Jana Sangh prioritized the fulfilment of basic needs like food, clothing and shelter and\nself-sufficiency for the country. Swadeshi was a strong policy position and regulated trade; specifically, minimal imports of\nconsumer goods were crucial. Jana Sangh spoke about the Indianization of foreign-owned industries, the nationalization of\nforeign banks and minimal foreign aid. Better planning for industrial growth, micro-planning for the public sector to make\nit more profitable and efficient and macro-planning for the economy as a whole were discussed. The use of labour-\nintensive and Swadeshi technology was also encouraged. The word share for this category has declined since the 1980s; it\nhas been less than 15% in recent BJP manifestos, with a high of 28% in 2009 (see Figure 10B). Economic reforms and\nincentives to increase industrial production, improve public sector enterprises and better the unincorporated sector have\nbeen the major focus of this category in recent manifestos. Despite this declining word share, the protection of small-scale\nand cottage industries and providing incentives for their growth has been a mainstay. 34.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nFIGURE 10B / ECONOMIC PLANNING\n\nParties often talk about economic goals in manifestos,\nseldom talk about inflation\n\nPercentage of economic planning content in Lok Sabha election manifestos used for different\ntopics (1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP CPI/CPM\n\n60% of economic\n\nplanning\nEconomic Goals thal 30%\n\n1952 2019\n60%\n\nsmmioymen og oho pole ldo\n\nINC has been emphasising on free\n\nmarket economy since liberalisation 60%\nFree Market 30%\nEconomy\n\n60%\nIn their 2019 manifestos, INC and\n\nPrice Rise and BJP made no mention Pp inflation 30%\ninfetion on\n\n60%\nPro-State 30%\nIntervention\n\n1952 2019 1952 2019 1952 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n\n35.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nCongress had been a staunch supporter of state intervention from the very first election, citing in its 1952 manifesto that the\nPlanning Commission was intended to plan all aspects of national life. The party\u2019s aim to structure the economic and social\norganization of India as a Socialist Cooperative Commonwealth has been clearly stated. Congress had historically focused\non nationalization, the public sector and the protection of small industries. A clear change can be seen post-1996, with\nwords dedicated to pro-state intervention declining to below 12% and being almost non-existent for three consecutive\nyears. The aggressive pro-state intervention bent vanished by the 2000s when it became evident that \u201cboth the public\nsector and private sector are essential for India\u2019s continued high growth success story,\u201d in the words of the party itself.\n\nThis category is the main priority for the Left, with almost 45% of the word share dedicated to it on average across time.\nThere is a disproportionate emphasis on the importance of land reforms and the plight of the working class. The party also\npushed for exclusively left-leaning economic policies, such as nationalisation, socialism, checks on monopolies, increase in\nwealth, corporate and income taxes for the affluent classes and reduction of foreign aid and foreign capital. The party has\nalso called for an increase in public investment in agriculture and infrastructure.\n\nFree market economy\n\nA free market economy, as a neutral category, is devised to take note of policy positions parties have with respect to free\nmarket capitalism as an economic model. This category captures both criticisms that are meted out against capitalism as\nwell as favourable positions.\n\nIn the initial decades of independent India, the Jana Sangh clearly stated their intention of following a mixed economy\nsystem in which a balance between private and state enterprises was the goal. Jana Sangh\u2019s manifestos indicate their plan\nto encourage private enterprise, maintain competitive markets, reduce controls like complicated taxation and regulations\nand welcome foreign capital, as long as there aren't any political strings. Another important aspect was no state ownership\nof industries except defence and essential items.\n\nOn average, the BJP has spent 23% of its words on a free market economy in the domain of Economic Planning. The word\nshare for this category decreased in the 1980s when the new BJP emphasized economic goals to address the issue of\neconomic crisis. Post-1991, the BJP has dedicated 30% of the words of the Economy domain to this category on average.\nWhile 2009 didn\u2019t have much focus on this category, in recent years, the BJP has prioritized Foreign Direct Investment,\ninternational trade and commerce, globalization and economic and financial reforms to improve the ease of doing\nbusiness for entrepreneurship and developing the competitive industry, manufacturing and services sectors.\n\nSimilar to the BJP, Congress has changed its position over time, from pro-state intervention to a free market economy.\nWords dedicated to a free market economy have consistently increased post-1991, with 43% in their 2019 manifesto. In\n1957, Congress stated that the private sector will remain subservient to the demands of the Five-Year Plans. It further stated\nthat laissez-faire is \u201cpeculiarly unsuited\u201d to India and it is incompatible with planning.\n\nA shift emerged around 1991 when Congress advised opening the domestic market to foreign competitors. By the election\nof 1998, after seeing how the free-market policies had played out in India, the Congress came out in full support of\nliberalization and called for a lowering of duties and regulation of tariffs, disinvestment and fair competition. They also\ncalled for complete delicensing of all but certain strategic industries. Now, Congress appears keen on dipping its toes in\nboth free-market and pro-state pools, without committing to either. But the tilt towards the free market is evident, even\nthough it is supplemented with some interventionist measures.\n\n36.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nThe Left has the least amount of word share for a free market economy, especially before 1991. On average, merely 12% of\nthe word share was dedicated to this category, and that was mainly criticism. Even as Congress began to court free-market\neconomic policies post-economic reforms, the Left remained staunchly opposed to it. Liberalization was seen as the reason\nbehind India\u2019s financial turmoil and left parties argued against rampant privatization, the dismantling of the public sector\nand the entry of foreign investment. It was wary of global competition and cautioned against subjecting Indian agriculture\nto the \u201cvagaries of the international market.\u201d It criticized the BJP primarily for favouring big businesses and foreign\ncompanies. The sole favourable mention of free market policy from the Left was when it demanded foreign capital in areas\nwith pre-defined priorities. The private sector is considered important by them only in new product areas, research and\ndevelopment (R&D) and service sector domains such as tourism.\n\nInflation and Employment\n\nPrice rise and inflation have often been major political agendas during elections. They may not bea crucial category that is\naddressed in detail, but they do garner enough importance to receive a special mention. In fact, all political parties ensure\nthat they include their intention to maintain price stability and question the ruling party\u2019s failure to control price rises.\nWhile there is no pattern in the BJP and the INC manifestos in this category and the words dedicated to inflation are also\nfewer, the Left manifestos are much more consistent in mentioning this category, with 7-12% of the Economic Planning\nword share being dedicated to this category in the last three manifestos.\n\nEmployment is a major category of focus for all political parties. Congress mentions measures to ensure employment\nregularly. At least 10% of the words in this domain are related to employment, a share that has increased up to 21% as well.\nThe BJP and the Left also emphasize decreasing unemployment and associated methods to generate employment with\nregularity.\n\n37.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\nGiven India\u2019s tumultuous colonial past and its nuanced relationships with neighbouring countries and global superpowers,\nNational Security has remained an important domain in the parties\u2019 manifestos. While the share of this domain in\nmanifestos has slightly declined in the last few decades still the domain occupies at least a tenth of space across party\nmanifestos (see Figure 11A). The parties have given considerable attention to discussing foreign policy and relations with\nexternal entities\u2014which include international governmental organizations and other countries\u2014and matters of internal\nsecurity. The other categories in this domain also include more specific military and security goals, as well as terrorism on\none hand, but also see parties articulate larger ideological positions on world peace, internationalism and other global\nissues on the other hand.\n\nFIGURE 11A / NATIONAL SECURITY\nIn the last two elections, a tenth of all three manifestos were\nabout national security\n\nPercentage of Lok Sabha election manifestos dedicated to national security (1952-2019)\n\nBJS/BJP INC CPI/CPM\n30% of\nmanifesto\n20%\noy fia, {L JL. [7p fr\nI | | | | |\n1952 2019 1952 2019 1952 2019\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n\nForeign special relationships\n\nForeign special relations, another neutral category, captures any mentions\u2014favourable or unfavourable\u2014of particular\ncountries with whom India has a special relationship. For the purposes of this analysis, the status of \u201cspecial relationship\u201d\nhas been restricted to Pakistan, China, Russia (or the USSR/Soviet Union) and the United States. Favourable expressions,\ni.e., the need for cooperation with, sending aid to, or restoring/strengthening diplomatic ties with these countries, are\nrecorded under this category. Equally, unfavourable mentions, i.e., aggressive action, blaming them for terrorist acts, or\nborder violations, are recorded too.\n\nOf the three parties, the CPI(M) has spent the highest proportion of words on this subcategory, having accorded it 52% of its\ntotal domain word share in 1980. The emphasis placed by the INC has reduced over time. The same applies to the BJP,\nleaving the Left parties to be the only ones to be invested in the Foreign Special Relationships the nation has, owing to their\nstrong anti-imperialist stands.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nThe CPI(M) has continually called for the maintenance and strengthening of India\u2019s relationship with China, Russia and\nother socialist countries since its Independence. In fact, it often reserves specific sections exclusively for India-China or\nIndia-Russia relations. The language with which the CPI(M) discusses these countries\u2014for example, describing China and\nits model of development as \u2018glorious,\u2019 or lauding the development of class consciousness in Russia\u2014is overtly positive.\n\nIt has even spearheaded the case for enhancing China\u2019s position in the United Nations and giving the country more say by\nawarding it a permanent seat on the Security Council. Additionally, the CPI(M) has aggressively and consistently\nscrutinized India\u2019s relationship with the United States, predating even the onset of India\u2019s liberalization and globalization\npolicies in the 1990s. It frequently condemns the ruling parties\u2019 decision to ally with the Western nations and criticizes the\nWestern nations\u2019 influence on the economic and foreign policy-related decisions undertaken by the governments of the\nruling parties.\n\nIn fact, the greatest number of words spent by the Left on external relations was in 1967, anda majority of this word-share\nwas dominated by aggressively pro-China, pro-socialism and anti-Western imperialism messaging. The spike in word\ncount corresponds directly with the turbulent events that influenced communist politics that had directly preceded it, such\nas the 1962 Sino-Indian War and the CPI split in 1964 (see Figure 11B). The Congress, on the other hand, has expressed\nsupport for developing India\u2019s relationships with the socialist world but is also quick to decry China for its border and\nterritorial violations. This pro-Soviet, pro-China bent is largely absent from the B]P\u2019s manifestos.\n\nAll parties refer to matters pertaining to Pakistan generally in non-controversial terms. Harsh turns of phrase and military\nmeasures are encouraged in case of fricative, politically-charged events, such as the Bangladesh War in 1971 and the Kargil\nattack in 1999. Even so, the parties do emphasise the importance of restoring friendly relations between the two countries,\noften through peaceful rather than forceful measures.\n\nExternal influence\n\nAnother pertinent subcategory within the domain is external influence. This refers to negative mentions of imperial or\ncolonial behaviour, forceful occupation and one state exerting a strong or undue influence (political, military or\ncommercial) over other states. Statements against international financial organizations or states using monetary means to\nassert strong influence over the manifesto or other states are also included. These refer to the influence of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on India\u2019s domestic economic activities,\nas well as statements against foreign debt and circumscribing state actions. It also includes favourable references to greater\nself-government within a state (i.e., decolonization and freedom movements in other countries). International alignments\n(i.e., North, South and non-aligned countries) and mentions of world orders (i.e., the \u2018third world\u2019) developed during the\nCold War have also been noted under this category.\n\nThe CPI(M) emerges as the most vocal and outspoken critic in this subcategory as well. Its staunchly anti-imperialist and\nanti-colonialist perspective is very evident across its texts. It is extremely critical of the Western\u2014admittedly, often\nAmerican\u2014bent of international organisations such as the World Bank and the IMF. It has repeatedly expressed interest in\ndivorcing India\u2019s economic activities and interests from those of these entities.\n\nBoth the INC and the BJP are not regular in articulating their stances on external influence. In the manifestos from the\n1990s, the BJP had criticised the Congress government's handling of the WTO, arguing that a Swadeshi, \u2018India First\u2019\napproach would be better suited for the national economy. The Congress, by virtue of being the party that had decided to\nenter into relations with the United States, has hardly vocalised their discontent with the way international monetary\nplatforms bend towards the West.\n\n39.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nThere are a considerable number of inter-party similarities in this category. In the 1950s and \u201960s, the initial manifestos of\nall three parties would frequently deride British rule and its debilitating influences on the Indian economy and society, as\nwell as the role it played in the Partition.\n\nThis gradually declined as their focus shifted to building friendly relations with other countries. One also sees strong\nsupport for the principle of non-alignment from these parties\u2014more so from the CPI(M) and Congress than the BJP. Words\nspent on non-alignment peaked in the election manifestos from 1977, 1984 and 1989. However, this petered out by the 90s;\nthis is unsurprising, as one may speculate that the cause, in due course, became obsolete, owing to the termination of the\nCold War. All parties have also expressed support, to varying degrees, for other countries and colonies\u2019 right to self-\ngovernment, such as the liberation of French Indochina and decolonization in other African and Asian countries.\n\nNational security goals\n\nThe category of national security goals is related to any generic mention of improving border security, methods of\nimproving security architecture and institutional effectiveness at the national levels. National security goals are noticeably\nabsent in manifestos from the INC and the Left, although this category suddenly appears in 2019. For the BJP, national\nsecurity goals are a usual presence, even if it is a small mention.\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\nJammu and Kashmir is a separate category because political parties discuss the issues of this state specifically and their\nstances are focused on the relevant circumstances of the time. For the BJP, issues related to ]&K are discussed in most\nyears, but the word share has been hovering around 8% in the three recent manifestos, down from 15% in 2004. Congress\nhas discussed J&K sparingly, but around 15% of the words in 2019 were used for this category. Left parties have mentioned\nJ&K with more regularity since 1998. However, 2019 was an outlier, with 25% of the word share dedicated to it (see Figure\n11B).\n\nThe BJP\u2019s stance towards the abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A, granting autonomy to Jammu and Ladakh and the\nreturn of Kashmiri Pandits has been consistent and clear. While the BJP supports giving more power to security forces to\ncontrol internal security threats, the Left supports a total withdrawal of AFSPA and Congress wants to review the same to\nachieve a balance. Congress and the Left want to involve all stakeholders in the peace process. They fully support Article 370\nand regional autonomy for Jammu and Ladakh simultaneously. Development of the region, free and fair elections and\nregional autonomy are priorities shared by all political parties.\n\nInternal Security\n\nInternal security includes statements related to tackling left-wing extremism or Naxalism and insurgency in India,\nespecially in the northeast. Earlier manifestos include references to Punjab\u2019s insurgency problem. Issues of illegal\nimmigration from neighbouring nations and armed struggle and instability in specific regions of India are mentioned here.\nInternal security is consistently mentioned by all parties.\n\nTerrorism\n\nWith respect to terrorism, parties usually discuss the prevention of attacks, better security and justice for victims and\npunishment for terrorists. There is no consistent trend for the category of terrorism, but it was mentioned in 2009 by all\nparties, possibly due to the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, and was again mentioned in 2019 by the BJP, but not as much by the Left\nand Congress.\n\n40.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nFIGURE 11B / NATIONAL SECURITY\nWhen making promises on national security, BJP and INC talk of goals and\nthe military\n\nPercentage of content on natioanl security in Lok Sabha election manifestos used for different topics\n(1952-2019)\nBJS/BJP IN Left\n\n50% of national\n\nit\nExternal security\nInfluence l | n 25%\n50%\nForeign Special\nRelationship 25%\n\nINC did not talk about internal security 50%\n\nInternal until fir. 1989 elections\nSecurity Jha 25%\n\n50%\n\nJammu and\ncrn JL In\n50%\n\nMilitary\nJin wut oJ\n50%\n\nNational Security\n\nSons elle | Low L| et\n\nAfter the 2008 terror attack, the 2009 election saw all three parties\nTerrorism spend a quarter of national security content in manifestos on terrorism\n\nA | 25%\n\n50%\n\nWorld Peace and 5\nInternationalism La puibt Tp 25%\n\n1952 2019 1952 2019 1952 2019\n\n50%\n\nSource: India Manifesto Project, 2022\n\nal.\n\f\n \n\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\nMilitary\n\nThis subcategory includes the importance of expanding the military and defence capabilities of the country. It contains\nreferences to the maintenance of, or increase in, military expenditure, improvement of military strength, securing\nadequate manpower and modernization of the armed forces. It also includes references to nuclear weapons, disarmament\nand nuclear testing treaties such as the NPT and the CTBT. On the whole, mentions of the military were absent in the initial\nelections. Upon the completion of the first nuclear test conducted by India in 1974, mentions of India\u2019s right to develop and\npossess nuclear weapons, but also simultaneously resistance to using weapons of mass destruction for the purposes of war,\nstarted becoming more common. All three parties unanimously agree on the idea that nuclear war ought to be avoided, the\nprocess of disarmament globally ought to be enforced and the nuclear treaties signed by India ought to be renegotiated in\nIndia\u2019s favour.\n\nOf the three parties, the BJP has spent the highest proportion of words discussing the military, while the Left has spent the\nlowest. While Congress and the CPI(M) have discussed this subject to the extent of maintaining existing levels of\nmilitarization, the BJP has spent a significant proportion of these sections discussing the need for increased militarization\nand an increase in military expenditure. There was a significant spike in the late \u201990s in terms of the word share given to the\nmilitary by the BJP as well. While a direct cause cannot be discerned for this spike, it should be noted that this occurred two\nyears after the launch of the ballistic missile Prithvi in 1994. The BJP spent the greatest number of words on external\nrelations in 1998, the year they won the election. Again, while causation cannot be established, it may be important to note\nthat this is the same year as when the Pokhran tests took place and a year before the Kargil attack, i.e, when tensions with\nPakistan were still brewing. Congress has historically spent a large portion of this section discussing the improvement of\nthe quality of life of jawans. This includes discussing reforms in terms of pension, living facilities for current and retired\nservicemen and remunerations to, and the general welfare of, families of deceased servicemen.\n\nWorld Peace and Internationalism\n\nThe final subcategory concerns support for diplomacy, negotiation, dialogue and other peaceful means of resolving\ninternational conflicts. This would include domestic peace and world peace as general goals. It also includes favourable and\nunfavourable references to the need for international and multilateral cooperation via the platform of intergovernmental\norganizations. Expressions of the need for global planning of resources and global governance are included. Any mentions\nof the Indian diaspora are included in it as well. Congress has spent a significant portion of its manifestos on the need for\npeace and internationalism, dedicating nearly 60% of its domain word share to this subcategory. The Congress\u2019s lengthiest\ndomain portions came in 1991, which corresponds with the introduction of their liberalization and globalization policies,\nand their goals for internationalism were emphasized in the same document as well. The Left has been far less regular in\narticulating matters under this category, preceded by the BJP.\n\nThe parties have also used their manifestos to express support for other countries or to decry imperialist and undemocratic\nsystems in others. For instance, the CPI(M) has continually shown support for the liberation of the people of Palestine. All\nthree parties have expressed their disapproval of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Moreover, a broad trend for the\nparties had been to aspire to strengthen relationships with immediate neighbours such as Pakistan and Nepal, and then\nbig superpowers such as the United States and Russia/the USSR.\n\nAs the ideas of the first, second and third worlds deepened during the Cold War, the parties began looking toward other\ncountries in South East Asia and East Asia. The parties have emphasized the importance of maintaining friendly relations\nwith such countries through platforms such as SAARC since 1985, and with other developing countries through BRICS since\n2006.\n\n42.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\nThe importance of studying manifestos to understand the changing nature of Indian politics has been highlighted in this\nreport conclusively. With domains and categories covering the entire gamut of issues, the data collected under the aegis of\nthe India Manifesto Project, 2022, could help us answer many important questions related to Indian democracy.\n\nDo voters allocate importance to manifestos or not, are manifestos just a rhetorical tool with no functional meaning or do\nthey shape a party's direction and motivation to act? Such questions need an exhaustive analysis and that remains an\nagenda of our future research. This can include research on some selected issues of importance and how they have been\nhandled in the past by political parties in terms of their stance and tone of action. Further research can also be undertaken\nto analyze whether there is a difference in the way political parties write and release manifestos when they are in\nopposition and when they are in power. Do parties in opposition have more critical manifestos? Are their statements more\ndetail-oriented? Do they give practical solutions and answer the \u2018how\u2019 more than the ruling parties? Is there a distinct type\nof method of manifesto being followed by specific parties? Similarly, the role and importance of state-level political parties\ncan also be studied as the kind of positions they\u2019ve held vis-a-vis their national-level competitors.\n\nWe hope that the Indian Manifesto Project succeeds in creating interest to fill among the many under-researched themes\nin Indian politics.\n\n43.\n\f\nCENTRE FOR POLICY RESEARCH | 2022\n\n \n\nAdams, James, Lawrence Ezrow, and Zeynep Somer-Topcu. 2014. \u201cDo Voters Respond to Party Manifestos or to a Wider Information\nEnvironment?

The\nfact that you blessed me to be your Pradhan Sevak at an extremely important time in the history of our\ncountry inspires me to work ever harder. In the last ten years, every moment of our time and every ounce of\nour energy has been dedicated for the people\u2019s welfare.\n\nWith your trust and support, the nation has seen a massive transformation over the last ten years. While\ndevelopment attained an unprecedented speed and scale, a significant transformation has also happened in\nterms of mindset.\n\nToday, our youth are speaking of creating Viksit Bharat by 2047 as a goal that is attainable, as a milestone\nthat will certainly be reached. The nation is confident on its journey of becoming self-reliant (Aatmanirbhar).\nThis is a big change from the atmosphere of desperation and frustration that the nation had experienced in\nthe decade prior to 2014 due to the corruption, policy paralysis and misrule by the government of those\ntimes.\n\nWe have gone from a nation that was in the \u2018Fragile Five\u2019 to a nation that is one of the top 5 economies of\nthe world. The most important facet of this progress is that the fruits of development reached everyone,\nespecially those who needed it the most. The mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka\nPrayas has guided our actions.\n\nThe nation\u2019s growth has been powered by the victory of 25 crore people in the battle against poverty. These\nare people who had suffered decades of deprivation of even basic necessities. Today, not only are they\nbenefiting from our saturation approach in basic needs like bank accounts, gas connections, toilets, water,\nelectricity, etc, but they are also being empowered with new-age facilities like optic fibre connections, digital\nsolutions, drones, etc.\n\nThe nation\u2019s growth has come from the drastic socio-economic transformation seen in the lives of women,\nfarmers, fisherfolks, street vendors, small entrepreneurs, SC, ST and OBC communities. They are being\ndirectly empowered through the power of technology such as the JAM trinity.\n\nFarmers have been a backbone of our nation\u2019s progress. Whether it is historic MSP hikes, massive rise in\nprocurement or making fertilisers available to them inexpensively despite globally high prices, direct income\nsupport through PM-KISAN, safety net of Fasal Bima, renewed focus on millets, expanded access to local and\nglobal markets, a number of steps have been taken to empower them. Our Annadatas are also becoming\nUrjadatas due to the PM KUSUM scheme. Empowered by our Beej Se Bazar Tak approach, our farmers have\ndone wonders for the country.\n\nThe nation\u2019s growth has been fueled by our focus on Vikas and Virasat.\n\nIndia has been setting new benchmarks in growth of both ecology and economy.\n\n \n\f\n_\u2122~\n\nThe nation\u2019s growth has been fueled by the achievements of our youth who have not only dared to dream\nbig but also worked to realise dreams in various domains such as space, sports and start-ups. In the last ten\nyears, whether it is education, employment or entrepreneurship, crores of new opportunities have been\ncreated for our youth.\n\nIt is deeply emotional for each Bharatiya Janata Party karyakarta, including me, to be involved in this\nmomentous journey as enablers of every Indian\u2019s aspirations.\n\nDuring an address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, | had said - Yahi Samay Hai, Sahi Samay Hai. Today,\nmany respected voices across the globe are also saying that this is India\u2019s time. In fact, today, India is being\nseen as an important player in the global efforts to create a better future.\n\nMaking the best use of this historic time period needs us to be proactive. The proactive nature of our\napproach is such that we have already worked on a plan of the decisions to be taken in the first 100 days of\nthe new government.\n\nAt such a time, when our nation is reacly to take off into a new phase of exponential growth, the Amrit Kaal,\nwe seek your blessings for the roadmap that we are unveiling for the next five years.\n\nIn the next five years, we will take our nation into the top 3 economies of the world, launch a final and\ndecisive assault against poverty, open up newer avenues of growth in various sectors, further intensify our\nbattle against corruption, unveil the next generation of reforms, and take a number of pro-people decisions\nand actions.\n\nOur Sankalp Patra is more than just a collection of promises. This Sankalp Patra outlines the collective\naspirations and goals of our nation, by our nation and for our nation. As you have seen in the last ten years,\nit is Modi\u2019s Guarantee that every promise made is fulfilled.\n\nIn 2014, we received your support to bring in a monumental transformation. In 2019, we received an even\nbigger mandate and ensured continued development and took big decisions. In the next five years, with\nyour blessings, it is Modi\u2019s Guarantee that we will work 24 by 7 for 2047.\n\nYour aspiration is our mission. Your dreams are our responsibility.\nLet us create a nation that future generations will be proud of!\n\nVande Mataram!\n\nYour Pradhan Sevak,\n\nNarendra Modi\n\na1 og nz\u00e9/\n\n \n\f\n \n\n+ | President\u2019s\n\n \n\nMy Dear Brothers and Sisters,\n\nThe philosophy of \u201cAntyodaya\u201d has been Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s guiding light since its foundation. This has\nmanifested itself in various programmes launched by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji aimed at Garib\nKalyan.\n\nIn just ten years, our government has achieved path-breaking milestones. With Sabka Saath and Sabka Prayas,\nwe are committed towards nation-building and promise to ensure Sabka Vikas by strengthening Sabka\nVishwas in the BJP government. Modi ki Guarantee 2024 Sankalp Patra is our resolve to continue this progress\nand progress forward in our journey.\n\nAs we enter Amrit Kaal of Bharat, a new Vision is now in front of us, a Vision driven by the Panch Pran\nenunciated by our Prime Minister. The General Elections of 2024 will be crucial in defining the course of our\ncountry. 97 crore voters have made up their minds. Citizens want to go forward. Everyone wants to build the\ncountry. People have decided to defeat the corrupt alliances.\n\nIn just ten years, all of us have worked to bring Bharat from Fragile 5 to place it among the Top 5 economies.\nWe are secure and safe today because we have a leader who is decisive and bold. We are building world class\ninfrastructure because we have a leader who believes in long term vision. We are building an equitable society\nbecause we have a leader who cares. Modi ki Guarantee is for all sectors and all 140 crore citizens.\n\nWe have embraced our rich heritage and diverse culture. Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has rejuvenated our\nsociety. Our cultural and religious sites are being restored across the country. Our young citizens are finding a\nnew interest in our history and heritage.\n\nToday our voice is being respected on all global platforms because we have a leader who puts Bharat First in all\ninternational affairs. We are trusted. We are attracting global value chains. We are becoming co-creators of\ntechnology.\n\nPrime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been fulfilling our aspirations since 2014. And today, ten years later, we\nonce again seek your vote and support to build the Viksit Bharat that we all have dreamed for. We seek your\nfull support to bring a massive majority to BJP and Narendra Modiji.\n\nVande Mataram!\n\nShri Jagat Prakash Nadda\nNational President, BJP\n\nee\n\n \n\n  \n\f\n \n   \n \n\n+ | Sankalp Patra\n\nMy Dear Brothers and Sisters,\n\nAs we stand at the cusp of a transformational era in this country, it is a matter of immense pride and\ngratification for me to present to you the Modi Ki Guarantee 2024 Sankalp Patra. We have realised the\nimportance and significance of this document and the immense responsibility that was placed upon us to\ndefine the Vision of Viksit Bharat. It is our hope that this document captures the essence of the aspirations of\nthe 140 crore Bharatiyas.\n\nThe Sankalp Patra has been prepared after elaborate and intensive discussions with people across different\nclasses, communities and regions. We have made sure that each and every section of the society was heard\nand was able to share with us their aspirations. We express our sincere gratitude to each and every Bharatiya\nwho has given us their suggestions to us through our Viksit Bharat campaign. Your suggestions have made this\ndocument immensely richer.\n\nThis Sankalp Patra is the PM Modi\u2019s guarantee that we will work tirelessly to realise your dreams and\naspirations. The nation has witnessed immense progress and development in the last 10 years in this\ngovernment under the visionary leadership of PM Shri Narendra Modi. This Sankalp Patra is being presented\nbefore the 140 crore Bharatiya at a time when Bharat is taking great leaps across all the sectors, ensuring\nwelfare of all its citizens. It is this delivery that inspires unwavering confidence in every Modi ki Guarantee\namong the people of Bharat.\n\nWhen the BJP government came into power in 2014, it faced the daunting task of reviving the stalled\ndevelopment caused by widespread corruption, ineffective governance, and indecision during the tenure of\nthe previous government. Under the previous government, the nation had plunged into despair due to a lack\nof clear intentions, weak leadership, and a dearth of policies aimed at public welfare. Over the past ten years,\nwe have managed to steer the country away from the troubles inherited from a decade of mismanagement by\nthe previous government, while also accelerating the pace of development.\n\nThe second term of the NDA government under the leadership of PM Shri Narendra Modi is proof that the\nhopes of 140 crore Bharatiya have transformed into a solid trust and confidence.\n\n| would like to appeal to you to join hands with us and support us in the upcoming elections so that our\ncollective dream of Viksit Bharat is realised.\n\nVande Mataram!\n\nRajnath
