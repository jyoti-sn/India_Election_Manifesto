Shri Narendra Modi’s
Letter to the Nation

Mere Priya Parivarjan,

It has been a decade since you blessed Bharatiya Janata Party with the responsibility of serving you. The
fact that you blessed me to be your Pradhan Sevak at an extremely important time in the history of our
country inspires me to work ever harder. In the last ten years, every moment of our time and every ounce of
our energy has been dedicated for the people’s welfare.

With your trust and support, the nation has seen a massive transformation over the last ten years. While
development attained an unprecedented speed and scale, a significant transformation has also happened in
terms of mindset.

Today, our youth are speaking of creating Viksit Bharat by 2047 as a goal that is attainable, as a milestone
that will certainly be reached. The nation is confident on its journey of becoming self-reliant (Aatmanirbhar).
This is a big change from the atmosphere of desperation and frustration that the nation had experienced in
the decade prior to 2014 due to the corruption, policy paralysis and misrule by the government of those
times.

We have gone from a nation that was in the ‘Fragile Five’ to a nation that is one of the top 5 economies of
the world. The most important facet of this progress is that the fruits of development reached everyone,
especially those who needed it the most. The mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka
Prayas has guided our actions.

The nation’s growth has been powered by the victory of 25 crore people in the battle against poverty. These
are people who had suffered decades of deprivation of even basic necessities. Today, not only are they
benefiting from our saturation approach in basic needs like bank accounts, gas connections, toilets, water,
electricity, etc, but they are also being empowered with new-age facilities like optic fibre connections, digital
solutions, drones, etc.

The nation’s growth has come from the drastic socio-economic transformation seen in the lives of women,
farmers, fisherfolks, street vendors, small entrepreneurs, SC, ST and OBC communities. They are being
directly empowered through the power of technology such as the JAM trinity.

Farmers have been a backbone of our nation’s progress. Whether it is historic MSP hikes, massive rise in
procurement or making fertilisers available to them inexpensively despite globally high prices, direct income
support through PM-KISAN, safety net of Fasal Bima, renewed focus on millets, expanded access to local and
global markets, a number of steps have been taken to empower them. Our Annadatas are also becoming
Urjadatas due to the PM KUSUM scheme. Empowered by our Beej Se Bazar Tak approach, our farmers have
done wonders for the country.

The nation’s growth has been fueled by our focus on Vikas and Virasat.

India has been setting new benchmarks in growth of both ecology and economy.

 

_™~

The nation’s growth has been fueled by the achievements of our youth who have not only dared to dream
big but also worked to realise dreams in various domains such as space, sports and start-ups. In the last ten
years, whether it is education, employment or entrepreneurship, crores of new opportunities have been
created for our youth.

It is deeply emotional for each Bharatiya Janata Party karyakarta, including me, to be involved in this
momentous journey as enablers of every Indian’s aspirations.

During an address from the ramparts of the Red Fort, | had said - Yahi Samay Hai, Sahi Samay Hai. Today,
many respected voices across the globe are also saying that this is India’s time. In fact, today, India is being
seen as an important player in the global efforts to create a better future.

Making the best use of this historic time period needs us to be proactive. The proactive nature of our
approach is such that we have already worked on a plan of the decisions to be taken in the first 100 days of
the new government.

At such a time, when our nation is reacly to take off into a new phase of exponential growth, the Amrit Kaal,
we seek your blessings for the roadmap that we are unveiling for the next five years.

In the next five years, we will take our nation into the top 3 economies of the world, launch a final and
decisive assault against poverty, open up newer avenues of growth in various sectors, further intensify our
battle against corruption, unveil the next generation of reforms, and take a number of pro-people decisions
and actions.

Our Sankalp Patra is more than just a collection of promises. This Sankalp Patra outlines the collective
aspirations and goals of our nation, by our nation and for our nation. As you have seen in the last ten years,
it is Modi’s Guarantee that every promise made is fulfilled.

In 2014, we received your support to bring in a monumental transformation. In 2019, we received an even
bigger mandate and ensured continued development and took big decisions. In the next five years, with
your blessings, it is Modi’s Guarantee that we will work 24 by 7 for 2047.

Your aspiration is our mission. Your dreams are our responsibility.
Let us create a nation that future generations will be proud of!

Vande Mataram!

Your Pradhan Sevak,

Narendra Modi

My Dear Brothers and Sisters,

The philosophy of “Antyodaya” has been Bharatiya Janata Party’s guiding light since its foundation. This has
manifested itself in various programmes launched by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji aimed at Garib
Kalyan.

In just ten years, our government has achieved path-breaking milestones. With Sabka Saath and Sabka Prayas,
we are committed towards nation-building and promise to ensure Sabka Vikas by strengthening Sabka
Vishwas in the BJP government. Modi ki Guarantee 2024 Sankalp Patra is our resolve to continue this progress
and progress forward in our journey.

As we enter Amrit Kaal of Bharat, a new Vision is now in front of us, a Vision driven by the Panch Pran
enunciated by our Prime Minister. The General Elections of 2024 will be crucial in defining the course of our
country. 97 crore voters have made up their minds. Citizens want to go forward. Everyone wants to build the
country. People have decided to defeat the corrupt alliances.

In just ten years, all of us have worked to bring Bharat from Fragile 5 to place it among the Top 5 economies.
We are secure and safe today because we have a leader who is decisive and bold. We are building world class
infrastructure because we have a leader who believes in long term vision. We are building an equitable society
because we have a leader who cares. Modi ki Guarantee is for all sectors and all 140 crore citizens.

We have embraced our rich heritage and diverse culture. Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya has rejuvenated our
society. Our cultural and religious sites are being restored across the country. Our young citizens are finding a
new interest in our history and heritage.

Today our voice is being respected on all global platforms because we have a leader who puts Bharat First in all
international affairs. We are trusted. We are attracting global value chains. We are becoming co-creators of
technology.

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been fulfilling our aspirations since 2014. And today, ten years later, we
once again seek your vote and support to build the Viksit Bharat that we all have dreamed for. We seek your
full support to bring a massive majority to BJP and Narendra Modiji.

Vande Mataram!

+ | Sankalp Patra

My Dear Brothers and Sisters,

As we stand at the cusp of a transformational era in this country, it is a matter of immense pride and
gratification for me to present to you the Modi Ki Guarantee 2024 Sankalp Patra. We have realised the
importance and significance of this document and the immense responsibility that was placed upon us to
define the Vision of Viksit Bharat. It is our hope that this document captures the essence of the aspirations of
the 140 crore Bharatiyas.

The Sankalp Patra has been prepared after elaborate and intensive discussions with people across different
classes, communities and regions. We have made sure that each and every section of the society was heard
and was able to share with us their aspirations. We express our sincere gratitude to each and every Bharatiya
who has given us their suggestions to us through our Viksit Bharat campaign. Your suggestions have made this
document immensely richer.

This Sankalp Patra is the PM Modi’s guarantee that we will work tirelessly to realise your dreams and
aspirations. The nation has witnessed immense progress and development in the last 10 years in this
government under the visionary leadership of PM Shri Narendra Modi. This Sankalp Patra is being presented
before the 140 crore Bharatiya at a time when Bharat is taking great leaps across all the sectors, ensuring
welfare of all its citizens. It is this delivery that inspires unwavering confidence in every Modi ki Guarantee
among the people of Bharat.

When the BJP government came into power in 2014, it faced the daunting task of reviving the stalled
development caused by widespread corruption, ineffective governance, and indecision during the tenure of
the previous government. Under the previous government, the nation had plunged into despair due to a lack
of clear intentions, weak leadership, and a dearth of policies aimed at public welfare. Over the past ten years,
we have managed to steer the country away from the troubles inherited from a decade of mismanagement by
the previous government, while also accelerating the pace of development.

The second term of the NDA government under the leadership of PM Shri Narendra Modi is proof that the
hopes of 140 crore Bharatiya have transformed into a solid trust and confidence.

| would like to appeal to you to join hands with us and support us in the upcoming elections so that our
collective dream of Viksit Bharat is realised.

Vande Mataram!

BJP

India is the most ancient civilization of the world and has always been looked upon by the world as a
land of wealth and wisdom. India has been credited to have developed, apart from philosophy and
mathematics, science and technology of a very high order, which had attracted scholars from all over
the world. Al-Andalusi, a Spanish scholar in the 11th Century, in his monumental work 'Tabaqat al-
Umam' had discussed the state of science in different countries. He writes, ""The first nation to have
cultivated science is India... India is known for wisdom of its people. Over many centuries all the kings
of the past have recognized the ability of Indians in all branches of knowledge."" Andalusi further states,
""Indians, as known to all nations for many centuries, are the metal (essence) of wisdom, the source of
fairness and objectivity. They are the people of sublime pensiveness, universal apologues, and useful
and rare inventions.""

India's contribution to the march of civilization goes back to several thousand years before the Christian
era. From the Vedas to Upanishads and Gautam - the Buddha and Mahavira - the 24th Jain Tirthankara
and then to Kautilya and Chandra Gupta and down up to the eighteenth century, India was respected
for its flourishing economy, trade, commerce and culture. It had an international outreach from Korea
to Arabia, from Bamiyan to Borobudur and beyond. Before the advent of Britishers, Indian goods were
internationally recognized for their quality and craftsmanship. India had a much bigger role and presence
in industry and manufacturing than any nation in Europe or Asia. It had a well-developed banking
system and equally renowned businessmen, along with its financiers, who were contributing to create
a flourishing and progressive economy. According to Sunderland, India was also one of the greatest
shipbuilding nations and consequently had an access to international markets. Indian prosperity held
the world in thrall. lt was this wealth which attracted the foreigners - from Alexander to the Britishers.

Historical records establish the level of progress and prosperity attained by India before the advent of
the Europeans. Indian advancement in mathematics, astronomy, physics and chemistry along with
the biological sciences has been well recognized. India was a land of abundance, prosperity, affluence,
a land of sharing and caring living in perfect harmony and peace with the nature. From ancient times
almost all religions practiced in different parts of the world, have existed peacefully in India and will
continue to do so. India thus provides the most ennobling experience in spiritual co-existence.

BJP recognizes that no nation could chart out its domestic or foreign policies unless it has a clear
understanding about itself, its history, its roots, its strengths and failings. In a highly mobile and
globalized world, it is imperative for a nation to know its roots that provide sustenance to its people. \

Indian freedom struggle, which was inspired by Tilak, Gandhi, Aurobindo, Patel, Bose and others, had
a clear vision of the civilizational consciousness of India. These leaders had directed the freedom
movement, keeping the Indian ways and thoughts in the centre of their action. They had a vision to
reconstruct the political and economic institutions of India as a continuum of civilizational consciousness,
which made India one country, one people, and one Nation.

After achieving independence, the leaders at the helm of affairs lost the spirit and the vision, which the
freedom movement had evoked. They discarded the vision and adopted the institutional framework of
administration created by the Britishers which was quite alien to India's world-view. It is unfortunate
that these leaders could not comprehend India's inner vitality, which was the main force responsible for
India's survival despite several attacks and prolonged foreign rule and thus, failed to rekindle the spirit
of India.

 

Even after nearly seven decades of our independence, the country has not been able to discover its
innate vitality, the sense of time and the will to act. As a result, in spite of being the oldest civilization
and a young republic, we are engulfed by a multi-dimensional crisis. A crisis, which has encompassed
all walks of life. The rising disparities, social and communal divide and terrorism leading to a fractured
society, are worsening the situation rapidly. The present crisis is the result of this confusion and
disconnect from the seekings and sensibilities of the people. This is worse confounded by the weak
and spineless leadership of the UPA Government. The tragedy is further heightened by their failure to
diagnose the malady and find the remedy. Instead of creating a socio-economic and political paradigm
of governance drawn from the civilizational consciousness of India, the leaders tried to follow whatever
was being practiced in this or that western country.

Thus, we have wasted more than half of a century. Many other countries, even with smaller size and
lesser resources, have surpassed us in development parameters. Another reason for this is that the
Governance in these decades was marred by lack of trust, leading to excessive controls. It was also
marked by lack of openness in Government and lack of people's participation. This has led to
concentration of power in a few hands and lack of transparency breeding corruption and nepotism on
a massive scale. The so-called ‘liberalization’ came in 1990s, but it was half-hearted. It didn't work
because the rest of the eco-system remained the same. However, the beginning of the 21st century
showed some light under the NDA rule. India started being reckoned as an economic superpower. The
six-year rule of NDA had given the Nation many firsts, building an image in the International community.
However, many of the hopes, potentials and projects have not been fully realized in the subsequent
years. But after 2004, UPAcame into power and the situation started worsening again. We missed a
historic national opportunity once more.

UPA's biggest blow to the Indian political system is that they have taken out Genuineness from

Governance; Authenticity from Administration. UPA has shown Governance of Enactment, not
Action. It has given an Administration of Entitlement without Delivery. We have become a polity of
Promises, and not Performance. We represent an economy of deficits, a work culture of delays
and an asset base of deficiency. Worse, Congress-led UPA has made India a global synonym of
Corruption, Scandal and Stagnation. To make it even worse, today, we are passing through total
Decision and Policy Paralysis. Sluggish economic growth, unprecedented price rise and unstable
Currency are its most visible facets.

The following demand urgent solutions; economy including agriculture, energy, environment including
natural resources, education and health, employment, external and internal threats to security,
empowerment, Governance, and erosion of moral and societal values.

If India has to survive as a nation, which it has to, in order to play its destined role in the comity of
nations, if it has to make its voice heard for creating a peaceful and egalitarian world order, then we
must take up the challenges with urgency and determination and provide proper solutions for them. It
is a pity that we have a demoralized leadership presiding over the state apparatus, which is incompetent
to handle the present problems. What is needed today is to arrive at a consensus about the ‘Idea’ of
India and also to think and redesign our approach in consonance with the seekings and preferences of
the Indian people.

The situation in the country is deteriorating rapidly. Delay in resolving the crisis would be dangerous.
What is needed is to take lessons from history, recognise the vitality and resilience of India, the power
of its world-view and utilize its strength, which drove it to glorious heights and analyse its weaknesses,
which led to this abysmal fall. Pick up the thread from the point where the continuum of our civilizational

BJP

consciousness was lost and reorient the polity in consonance with those strong points of Indian
psyche which will be the engine for our future glory. Let's keep the windows open, have a clear
understanding of the global scenario and how without destroying our uniqueness we can assimilate
the best of the technological advancements.

We can achieve this goal provided the leaders seriously set to this task. What we need is a political
party committed to deliver and a leadership with strong determination and political will. As Vivekananda
had said, ""All power is within you. You can do anything. Believe in that."" Yes, the power lies in the
people of India, in the inner sanctum sanctorum of Mother India. What is needed is to ignite the spark
and Mother India would rise in her full glory.

As Sri Ma had once said that India had become the symbolic representation of all the difficulties of
modern mankind but India will also be the land of its resurrection to a higher and truer life. The BJP will
leave no stone unturned to fulfill the dream of 1.22 billion Indians.

Today, India is blessed with the rare capacity and opportunity of Democracy, Demography and
Demand. If we are able to consolidate and harness them, we will be able to reach the heights which
India deserves. The biggest reason for a sorry state of affairs is bad intentions on the part of those who
have ruled the country for sixty years. And that is where we would show the first difference. For BJP,
the goal of the policies and practices would be: Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat! The path would be:
Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas. This is our commitment to the Nation and to the People.

With this determination of the party under the charismatic leadership of Shri Narendra Modi, we enter
the elections to the 16th Lok Sabha and would work whole-heartedly to give a stable, strong, visionary
and progressive Government to India.

Itis an opportunity to change our fate and of our nation.

Glory to Mother India, glory to Her children.

Attend the Imminent

Decade under the UPA - | and II can rightly be summed in one line, the 'Decade of Decay’, in which
India had a free fall on all fronts - be it governance, economy, diplomacy, foreign policy, border safety,
etc. At the same time, corruption, scams and crime against women have reached to unacceptable
levels. There has been gross misuse and total denigration of government and institutions. There has
also been erosion of authority of the office of the Prime Minister. The Government dithered by each
passing day, casting gloom and doom on the country that was once under the NDA regime called the
‘Emerging Superpower’. In 2004, NDA left the Government with a near double digit growth. The Congress-
led UPA could not even maintain that growth and mismanaged the country so badly, that the growth
rate declined to 4.8%, resulting the country falling ina deep mess. We have lost a wonderful opportunity
and have pushed the country 20 years behind and rendered millions of men and women jobless.

Critical and urgent challenges facing the nation have been left unaddressed. Beyond impacting the
immediate short-term, this is corroding the long-term potential of the nation. People feel frustrated and
have lost hope in the system. Things must change, and they must change now. BJP will take immediate
and decisive action to address these issues on a priority basis.

Price Rise

Runaway food inflation has crippled household budgets and contributed to the overall inflationary trend
under the Congress-led UPA's watch. Even worse, the food and nutritional security of millions is
threatened. However, the Congress-led UPA government has remained insensitive and indifferent to the
plight of the people; tying itself into knots with short-term, mis-directed steps. The committee of Chief
Ministers, headed by Shri Narendra Modi, has already submitted a report on food inflation in 2011. The
report was unfortunately not acted upon by the Congress-led UPA Government.

 

The BJP-led NDA Government's record of holding the prices is a demonstration of our commitment to
break the vicious cycle of high inflation and high interest rates. Our immediate task will be to rein in
inflation by several steps, such as:

e putin place strict measures and special Courts to stop hoarding and black marketing.
setting up a Price Stabilisation Fund.

e
e unbundle FCI operations into procurement, storage and distribution for greater efficiency.
e

leverage on technology to disseminate Real time data, especially to farmers - on production,
prices, imports, stocks and overall availability.

e evolve a single 'National Agriculture Market’.
e@ promote and support area specific crops and vegetables linked to food habits of the people.
Employment and Entrepreneurship

The country has been dragged through 10 years of Jobless Growth by the Congress-led UPA
Government. Under the broader economic revival, BJP will accord high priority to job creation and
opportunities for entrepreneurship. We will:

 

e strategically develop high impact domains like Labour-intensive manufacturing (viz. textile,
footwear, electronics assembly, etc.) and Tourism.

strengthen the traditional employment bases of agriculture and allied industries, and retail -
through modernization as well as stronger credit and market linkages.

 

BJP

harness the opportunities provided by the upgradation of infrastructure and housing, for its job
generating potential.

encourage and empower our youth for self-employment - incubating entrepreneurship as well as
facilitating credit.

address the employability issue by initiating a multi-skills development programme in mission
mode. Focus will be on job creation and entrepreneurship, in both rural and urban areas.

transform our Employment Exchanges into Career Centres - connecting our youth with job
opportunities in a transparent and effective manner through the use of technology; as well as
providing counselling and training.

Corruption

Corruption is a manifestation of poor Governance. Moreover, it reflects the bad intentions of those
sitting in power. All pervasive corruption under the Congress-led UPA has become a ‘National
Crisis’.

We will establish a system, which eliminates the scope for corruption. We will do this through:

e public awareness

e technology enabled e-Governance - minimizing the discretion in the citizen-government interface.

e system-based, policy-driven governance - making it transparent.

e

rationalization and simplification of the tax regime - which is currently repulsive for honest
tax payers.

simplification of the processes and procedures at all levels - bestowing faith in the citizens,
institutions and establishments.

 

Black Money

By minimizing the scope for corruption, we will ensure minimization of the generation of black money.
BJP is committed to initiate the process of tracking down and bringing back black money stashed in
foreign banks and offshore accounts. We will set up a Task Force for this purpose and to recommend
amendments to existing laws or enact new laws. The process of bringing back black money to India
what belongs to India, will be put in motion on priority. We will also proactively engage with foreign
Governments to facilitate information sharing on black money.

Decision and Policy Paralysis

The country has suffered a decade of maladministration and scams in addition to decision and policy
paralysis; thus bringing growth and development to a grinding halt leading to a ‘Governance deficit’.
This situation will be changed and the engine of Government will be ignited again with strong willpower
and commitment to public interest. We will also encourage the bureaucracy to take right decisions
and contribute their might in building a modern India.

Poor Delivery

 

 

Wherever we go, we encounter bottlenecks. We experience it on a daily basis - in government offices
for even the simplest of public services, in our courts buried in high pendency and so on. Similarly, we
are known by a culture of missing links and lack of last mile connectivity. We have water but no
pipeline to carry it; we have schools but no teachers; we have computers and machines but no
electricity; we have scientists but no labs; we have instruments but no one to work on them. This

reduces the pace of our performance and results into wastage of time, money and energy. Intent to do
the right thing and the will to do things rightly, is missing. This has to be attended to on a priority basis.

Whatever we do and provide for, the whole chain has to be kept in mind. With this in mind,
we will:

remove bottlenecks and missing links in all sectors, activities and services.

focus on proper planning and execution for right outcomes.

strive for scale and speed with futuristic vision.

Build institutions for today and tomorrow.

Credibility Crisis

The biggest challenge that India faces today is to restore the credibility of, and trust in the Union
Government. In recent years, the Union Government has lost every semblance of credibility. Its intentions,
integrity and initiatives, all are questionable. The Congress party has not only lowered the dignity of the
Government, but also the dignity of India. This is what is driving recent adversities like the falling rupee
and countries riding roughshod over us. The BJP will work for restoring the trust and credibility of the
Government. We will also ensure that the chain of responsibility and accountability is built in the
system.

Strengthen the Framework

Team India

Centre-State Relations

India is a diverse country. Diverse communities settled in vastly different regions have their own aspirations.
Taking these aspirations into consideration, the centre and the states therefore have to evolve a working
system, which leads to harmonious relations. The genuine grievances of every state will be addressed
in a comprehensive manner.

We will place Centre-State relations on an even keel through the process of consultation and strive
for harmonious Centre-State relations.

Our Government will be an enabler and facilitator in the rapid progress of states. We will evolve a
model of national development, which is driven by the states.

Team India shall not be limited to the Prime Minister led team sitting in Delhi, but will also include
Chief Ministers and other functionaries as equal partners.

Ensure fiscal autonomy of States while urging financial discipline.

Create 'Regional Councils of States', with common problems and concerns, with a view to seeking
solutions that are applicable across a group of states.

We will encourage cooperation among states on security-related issues, inter-state disputes and
for removing inter-regional economic disparities and promoting tourism.

We recognize the special needs and unique problems of the hill and desert states. In consultation
with the Governments of these states, state-specific developmental priorities/ models will be evolved
so that the aspirations of the people are met.

Given the unique status of Union Territories (UTs), they will receive special attention. We will focus
on developing and strengthening the economy of UTs. Tourism will be promoted, tribal welfare and
their rights will receive full attention, and infrastructure and coastal area development will be given
top priority.

We reiterate our commitment to the protection and integrated development of our island territories.

The moribund forums like ‘National Development Council’ and Inter-State Council’ will be revived
and made into active bodies.

Involve the state Governments in the promotion of foreign trade and commerce.
Help the states mobilize resources through investments in industry, agriculture and infrastructure.
Integrating the Nation - Its Vastness and Voices

 

 

In ademocracy, everyone is not only free, but also encouraged to voice his or her concerns. It is also
necessary that these voices be heard and concerns redressed. However, all this should happen within
the framework of our constitution and with the spirit of India First’. We have to keep the Nation at the
forefront of our thoughts and actions. Any activity, which disrupts the integrity of the nation, cannot be
in the interest of any segment of the society or any region of the country. All Indians living in different
regions of the country have an equal stake in the progress of the country and they have to be assured
of the fruits of the progress.

e Presently, we see that there is a vast regional disparity between different regions of the country

 

along developmental parameters, particularly between the western part and the eastern part.
Despite their richness in both natural as well as human resources, eastern part of India still lags
behind.

We shall give the highest priority towards bringing the eastern parts of the country on par with the
western parts. To that extent, there shall be special focus and emphasis on the development of the
eastern side of India.

Government will play the role of an enabler and a facilitator to the rapid progress of the states;
planning along regional aspirations, strengths and potentials, evolving appropriate strategies
for various zones of the country - hilly regions, plains, desert and coastal areas.
Regional aspirations: BJP has always stood for greater decentralization through smaller States.
Northeast : Resource rich North-Eastern states are lagging behind in development due to poor
governance, systemic corruption and poor delivery of public services. NDA government had initiated
concrete steps to address the issue of development of Northeast by setting up the Ministry of North-
Eastern Region. We will empower this Ministry with a broader charter and non-lapsable funds for the
rapid development of the region.
BJP will:
put special emphasis on enhancing the connectivity within the region and to the rest of the country.
There will be special emphasis on massive infrastructure development, especially along the Line
of Actual Control in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim.
address the issue of Flood control in Assam and river water management.
nurture more job generating opportunities like tourism and IT industry.

address the issue of infiltration and illegal immigrants in the Northeast region on a priority basis.
This will include clear policy directions and effective control at the ground level.

complete all pending fencing work along the India-Bangladesh and India-Myanmar border, stepping
up border security.

take measures for the safety of North-Eastern students studying across the country including
setting up Hostels for North-Eastern students at various educational centres.

deal with Insurgent groups with a firm hand.

Jammu and Kashmir: Jammu and Kashmir was, is and shall remain an integral part of the Union of
India. The territorial integrity of India is inviolable. BUP will pursue an agenda of equal and rapid
development in all the three regions of the state - Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.

The return of Kashmiri Pandits to the land of their ancestors with full dignity, security and assured
livelihood will figure high on the BJP's agenda.

The long pending problems and demands of refugees from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK) will
be addressed.

BJP reiterates its stand on the Article 370, and will discuss this with all stakeholders and remains
committed to the abrogation of this article.

All steps will be taken to provide good governance, better infrastructure, educational opportunities,
healthcare and more job opportunities, leading to a better quality of life in the valley.

Seemandhra and Telangana: BJP is committed to do full justice to Seemandhra, and address the

issues of development and governance of Seemandhra and Telangana.
Decentralization and People's Participation
From Representative to Participatory Democracy

 

India is a country of immense diversity - a highly decentralized federal structure is thus crucial in
meeting the varied ideas and aspirations of our diverse people. Power is currently concentrated in
Delhi and the State capitals. We believe this power should be genuinely decentralized. BJP has stood
for greater decentralization through devolving of powers to the states. A vast reservoir of People's
Power has not yet been tested in the real sense. We have not been able to involve the people in
Governance as functionaries and facilitators.

e People's Participation: Our developmental process will be a people's movement - of Jan bhagidari.
We will make them the active drivers of development rather than mere passive recipients.

People's Engagement: Through Pro-active, Pro-people Good Governance, we will ensure the
Government itself directly reaches out to the people, especially the weak and marginalized sections
of society.

We will further evolve the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model into a People-Public-Private
Partnership (PPPP) model.

BJP is committed to strengthen self-Governance at the local level and we will empower Panchayati
Raj Institutions with extensive devolution of the 3 Fs - Functions, Functionaries and Funds.

Good performers amongst the Panchayats will be rewarded with additional developmental grants.

Strengthen the institution of the Gram Sabha, respecting their inputs and initiatives for development
process.

We will actively involve people in policy formulation and evaluation through various platforms.

We will encourage Openness in the Government, involving all stakeholders in the decision-making
processes.

Reform the System

Good Governance: Transparent, Effective, Involving and Encouraging

India First

BJP believes in India being one country, one people and one nation. BUP recognizes the importance of
diversity in Indian society, and the strength and vibrancy it adds to the nation. The party believes in the
principle of unity in diversity.

India constitutes of all its' people, irrespective of caste, creed, religion or sex. It constitutes of all the
communities - ethnic, social and cultural groups and also our culture, which is defined by tolerance
and co-existence. The hallmark of India is ""Unity in Diversity"". It constitutes of each and every inch of
our land, its natural resources and mental and physical energy we possess. It constitutes of all the
institutions made in the past and present.

India First simply means nurturing and protecting all the elements, which India is made of. It does not
exclude anyone or anything - it only includes everything and everyone, which India is made of. It is
complete India; without exclusion, without exception. It also means that whatever is in the interest of
India will be in the interest of all the elements that India is made up of, including its citizens.

The counter to the concept of ‘India First’ is what is happening today; appeasement of one, at the cost
of the other, using Institutions for protecting the interest of a particular party or persons. It is reflected
in the thinking that whatever is not in the interest of a party is not in the interest of India. Clearly,
Governance on these lines is not in the interest of India.

Simply speaking, ‘India First’ puts the national interest first while taking any decision or step both by
Governments and citizens. Even more simply put, you have to just see the face of India and Indians
when you are in doubt. This is what separates 'India First' from the present day politics and Governance
of the Congress-led UPA.
For BJP:

the only philosophy and religion of a Government should be India First.

the only epic of a Government should be India's Constitution.

the only power of a Government should be the power of the people.

the only prayer of a Government should be the welfare of its people.
e the only way of a Government should be 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’.

Open Government and Accountable Administration

Administrative reforms will be a priority for the BJP. Hence, we propose to implement them through an
appropriate body under the PMO. The objective will be to bring in transparency in Government's decision-
making process. Government systems and processes would be relooked to make them citizen friendly,
corruption free and accountable. Every effort will be made to meet the development aspirations of the
people and make the Government agencies accountable to the citizens. We will set-up an effective
Lokpal institution. Corruption at any level will be dealt with firmly and swiftly.

From birth certificate to school admission, from setting up business to paying of taxes, our present
systems complicate the lives of our own people. We will reform it and make it easy in terms of access,
efficiency and delivery. Following specific action will be initiated:

e digitization of Government records will be taken up on top priority so that they are easily accessible.

 

10

performance review, social and environment audit would be mandated for all Government schemes
and programmes.

open up Government to draw expertise from the industry, academia and society into the services.

government will be redefined by elimination of whatever is obsolete in laws, regulations, administrative
structures, practices and would be purposive.

we will generate 'Kartavya Bhavna' among public servants as lives and productivity of people is
dependent on the quality and efficiency of public services.

On the whole, hallmarks of our Governance model would be:
e People-centric

e Policy driven

e Time bound delivery

e Minimum Government, Maximum Governance
E-Governance: Easy, Efficient and Effective

BJP believes that IT is a great enabler for empowerment, equity and efficiency. The NDA Government
had made IT one of the major thrust areas. With the result, India is the IT capital for the whole world.
But back home, the benefits of IT have not percolated down. This will be a high priority area for BUP that
IT touches the lives of ordinary men and women. BJP has been known for good Governance and e-
Governance will become the backbone for good Governance. BJP aims to nurture a Digital India -
making every household and every individual digitally empowered.

 

Information Technology has made it possible to make information and services reach to the ordinary
men and women even in remote areas, easily and effectively. Availability of information is the key to

empowerment of the stakeholders. This also reduces the scope for discretion and manipulation.
We will:

focus on increasing the penetration and usage of broadband across the country. Deployment of
broadband in every village would be a thrust area.

leverage technology for e-Governance and engage proactively with the people through social media
for participative governance and effective public grievance redressal mechanism.

generate IT based jobs in rural and semi-urban areas.
make technology enabled products affordable for students.

use technology to reduce the burden of books on children. Make all institutions and schools e-
enabled in a phased manner. Digital learning and training to be used extensively.

pursue a mission mode project under the 'National Rural Internet and Technology Mission’ for use
of telemedicine and mobile healthcare for rural healthcare delivery; use of IT for agriculture for real
time information; Self Help Groups; retail trade and SMEs; and rural entrepreneurs, etc.

initiate a National e-Governance Plan to cover every Government office from the centre to the
panchayats. The 'E-Gram, Vishwa Gram' scheme in Gujarat to be implemented nationwide.

promote e-Bhasha - National Mission for the promotion of IT in Indian Languages.

focus to bring SC/ST, OBCs and other weaker sections of the society within the ambit of IT
enabled development.

Institutional Reform - Administrative, Judicial, Police and Electoral

Administrative

Today, people of this country are frustrated with the present system. Our administrative set up should
be people-centric, responsive and result-oriented. With this in mind, we are committed to bring the
following reforms:

the administration and its members will be made truly accountable to their tasks as well as the
people through rigorous evaluation process.

 

good performance will be rewarded; non-performers will be given opportunities and training support
to improve.

rationalization and convergence among the Ministries, departments and other arms of the
Government will be ensured to focus on delivery.

open up government to draw expertise from the industry, academia and society.

services of youth in particular will be tapped to contribute in governance with Fellowship and
Internship programmes launched at various levels.
Judicial
BJP is committed to ensure Justice for All - justice which is prompt and accessible. Understanding
that Justice Delayed is Justice Denied, we will adopt a multi-pronged approach to address the high
pendency of cases in our judicial system.

We will:

e accord high priority to judicial reforms to address the issue of appointment of judges, filling the

BJP
Widen the Platform

Certain segments of India have been historically disadvantaged. Due to a lopsided development approach
and skewed allocation of resources, they continue to lag behind the rest of the country in socio-
economic indicators in spite of having abundant natural resources and talent. Consequently, our
demographic dividend is not being fully actualized. It is the duty of the government to enable every
Indian to realize his or her full potential, ensuring equitable growth and development. We are committed
towards this end, and will ensure the same by:

e Empowering each and every Indian through health and education.

e Increasing Opportunities by making Job creation central to our economic model.

e Ensuring a basic level of Infrastructure to all - Home, Electricity, Water, Toilets and Access.
Poor and Marginalized - Bridge the Gap

Our Government will be a government of the poor, marginalized and left behind. Every Indian
has a right over everything that India has. From this, he or she is free to weave his or her own dreams.
The India of tomorrow will have 125 crore such dreams, and will be built on the same. We will not only
empower our citizens with the ability to dream; we will enable them with the capability to actualize
their dreams.

 

The real test of the success of a development process lies in the happiness of the common man. The
fruits of growth and development must reach the weakest, most deprived and remotest of people. With
firm belief in the concept of Antyodaya - uplifting the poorest of the poor - Extreme Poverty and
malnutrition will be treated as a National priority, and will be addressed on Mission Mode.

We will:

e strengthen Delivery of poverty alleviation programs through convergence, transparency and
efficiency.
identify 100 most backward districts of the country to bring them at par with other districts
through prioritized and integrated development.
strengthen the natural resource base of the people to tide over natural calamities.
aim to gainfully employ rural poor in agriculture and allied activities.
enable the urban poor to develop skills so that they take advantage of the emerging opportunities.

facilitate partnership across all levels of government, civil society, academic and financial institutions
in this national mission of poverty alleviation.

Food Security

BJP has always held that 'universal food security’ is integral to national security. BUP will take steps to
ensure that the benefits of the scheme reach the common man and that the right to food does not
remain an act on paper or a political rhetoric. BJP will review all the laws and schemes, in consultation
with the states, to ensure a corruption-free efficient implementation of food security, which would be a
priority.

BJP will:\

e review the successful PDS models, and incorporate the best practices to revise the existing PDS,
for benefitting the common man.

 

address the issue of under-nutrition and malnutrition.

encourage the production of cereals, pulses and oils.

radically transform the Food Corporation of India (FCl).

ensure contingency stocks for any exigencies arising due to natural calamities or external factors.
seek the participation of voluntary organizations in running community kitchens.

SCs, STs, OBCs and Other Weaker Sections - Social Justice and Empowerment

The BJP is committed to bridge the gap, following the principles of Samajik Nyay (social justice) and
Samajik Samrasata (social harmony). This social justice must be further complemented with economic
justice and political empowerment. Instead of pursuing identity politics and tokenisms, we will
focus on empowering the deprived sections of society. Steps will be taken to create an enabling
ecosystem of equal opportunity - for education, health and livelihood. We will accord highest priority
to ensuring their security, especially the prevention of atrocities against SCs & STs.

 

We believe that accelerated social justice and integrated developmentis the key to the progress of our
country and success of our democracy. The BJP is committed to bridge the divide following the
principle of social justice (Samajik Nyay) and social harmony (Samajik Samrasata). Instead of pursuing
identity politics and tokenisms, which have not led to any tangible results for the SC, ST, OBCs and
other weaker sections of our society, the BUP will focus on tangible development and empowerment.

e Ahigh priority for SC, ST, OBCs and other weaker sections would be to create an ecosystem for
education and entrepreneurship.

BJP is committed to the eradication of untouchability at all levels.
BJP is committed to eliminate manual scavenging.
BJP will look at more effective ways to pull these people out of the poverty line.

BJP will ensure that the funds allocated for schemes and programmes for SC, ST, OBCs and other
weaker sections are utilized properly.

A mission mode project would be made for housing, education, health and skills development.
Special focus would be on the children, especially the girl child, with regards to health, education
and skills development.

Tribal development will be one of the focus areas. BJP believes that half-hearted, incremental and
piecemeal attempts for the development of tribals have not helped. So the BJP commits to make a
comprehensive, all-encompassing long-term strategy to empower tribals and ensure their welfare. The
goal would be to ensure tribal development while preserving the unique identities of this community.
The Governments of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have successfully implemented the
tribal welfare and development schemes and their model would be used for tribal welfare and development.

BJP will initiate a 'Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojna' at the national level to be overseen by a 'Tribal Development
Authority’. This scheme will focus on:

e Setting up the entire education network for tribals.
Upgrading housing, water and health facilities.

e
e Electrification of tribal hamlets and provision of all - weather roads.
e

Initiating new economic activities.

Ensure that the tribal land is not alienated.
Facilitating access to minor forest produce and creating a network of rural haats (markets).

Establishing the National Centre for Tribal Research and Culture to preserve the tribal culture and
languages.

Enhancing the funds for tribal welfare and development.
Minorities - Equal Opportunity

BJP believes that in India's 'Unity in Diversity’ lies India's biggest strength. We cherish the depth and
vibrancy that the diversity in Indian society adds to the nation. BUP is thus committed to the preservation
of the rich culture and heritage of India's minority communities; alongside their social and economic
empowerment.

 

It is unfortunate that even after several decades of independence, a large section of the minority, and
especially Muslim community continues to be stymied in poverty. Modern India must be a nation of
equal opportunity. BUP is committed to ensure that all communities are equal partners in India's
progress, as we believe India cannot progress if any segment of Indians is left behind.
We will:

Ensure that the young, and the girl child in particular get education and jobs without discrimination.

Strengthen and modernize minority educational systems and institutions; dovetailing them with
modern requirements. National Madrasa modernization programme would be initiated.

Empower with vibrancy in Livelihood and Entrepreneurial opportunities.

Augment their traditional artisanship and entrepreneurial skill, which are a backbone of our cottage
and small-scale industry - strengthening these sectors through better market linkages, branding
and access to credit.

Empower Waqaf Boards in consultation with religious leaders; taking steps to remove encroachments
from and unauthorized occupation of Waqf properties.

Curate their rich heritage and culture - maintenance and restoration of heritage sites; digitization
of archives; preservation and promotion of Urdu.

Ensure a peaceful and secure environment, where there is no place for either the perpetrators or
exploiters of fear.

Facilitate the setting up of a permanent Inter-faith Consultative mechanism to promote harmony
and trust, under the auspices of religious leaders.

Neo-Middle Class - Meet their Aspirations

India has a large middle class with immense understanding, talent and purchasing power. In addition,
a whole new class has emerged. Those who have risen from the category of poor and are yet to
stabilize in the middle class, the 'neo middle class’. This class needs proactive handholding. Having
moved out of poverty, their aspirations have increased. They want amenities and services of a certain
standard. They thus now feel that Government facilities and services are not up to the mark, and hence
resort to the private sector for things like education, health and transport. This is obviously costly,
putting the neo middle class into a daily dilemma. As more and more people move into this category,

 

17

BJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014
Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat

 

their expectations for better public services have to be met. We have to strengthen the Public Sector
for providing efficient services to our citizens. In particular attention will be paid on government providing:

e Educational scholarships and educational facilities.
e Medical insurance and quality healthcare services.
e Middle-income housing.

Efficient public transport systems.
Rural Areas - High Priority

Two-thirds of our people live in villages. Lack of amenities to live and opportunities to work, however, are
restricting our rural life. Both these factors are the result of prolonged neglect. A full-fledged programme
for 'Rural Rejuvenation’ will be made and implemented which will comprise of integrated strategies for
personal, economic and social well being of the villagers. Through the idea of Rurban, we will bring
urban amenities to our rural areas, while retaining the soul of the village.

 

Agriculture, rural development and poverty alleviation go hand in hand. Major thrust area for rural
development would be to improve village level infrastructure in terms of roads, potable water, education,
health, supply chain, electricity, broadband, job creation, security in rural areas and linkage to markets.

Urban Areas - High Growth Centres

More than one-third of our population is already living in our cities and towns. Soon, the urban areas
will cover half our people. Moreover, our cities should no longer remain a reflection of poverty and
bottlenecks. Rather they should become symbols of efficiency, speed and scale.

We will look at urbanisation as an Opportunity rather than a Threat.
Major steps will be undertaken in Transport and Housing for 'Urban Upliftment' in India.

 

We will initiate building 100 new cities; enabled with the latest in technology and infrastructure -
adhering to concepts like sustainability, walk to work etc, and focused on specialized domains.

The approach to urban development will be based on integrated habitat development - building on
concepts like Twin cities and Satellite towns.

Upgrade existing urban centres, transitioning focus from basic infrastructure to public utility services
like Waste and Water Management - for a clean and healthy city life.

Cleanliness and Sanitation will be given priority - efficient Waste and Water management systems
will be set up. Model towns will be identified for rolling out integrated waste management
infrastructure.

Wi-Fi facilities will be made available in public places and commercial centres.

Urban poverty alleviation scheme would be a key thrust area.

Use technology for scientific, strategic and long term town planning - including GIS based mapping.
Build quality integrated Public Transport systems, discouraging usage of private vehicles.

Leap Forward

We have to give the taste of a developed country to this very generation. We have to take a quantitative
and qualitative leap. The time of knee jerk reactions and incremental changes has gone. What we
need is a quantum jump and a total change. We also believe that development has to be holistic,
uniform and all pervasive. Further, we have to make the people active partners in whatever is happening
and empower them to take advantage of the development process. We will make an effort that government
withdraws from those services which could be done by others and devote that extra time, money and
energy for social sectors, particularly for development of the weaker sections. And a common thread
will run across all our ideas and initiatives. This common thread is the wire and wave of Technology -
maximum application of technology for making governance easy, economical and effective.

Social Security - A Caring Government, Passionate Society

India has always been a caring society. It is in our culture to help the aged, the weak and the helpless.
We have to retain this. We have to educate our younger generations about this. The social security
schemes of the Governments have to be made more meaningful. Our aspirations get frustrated when
we encounter a weak social infrastructure. We need it on a daily basis.

Children - the Future of the Nation

""There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children"" -
Nelson Mandela

 

Indicators related to children welfare are an indicator of the progress of the nation, be it health, education
or safety of children. Under the UPA rule, the same has not been given its due weightage. BJP is
committed to address the issues related to children, like malnutrition and under-nutrition, problem of
child labour, child-trafficking and missing children, sexual abuse, school dropouts and the increasing
crime rate among juveniles. BJP will take the following steps to ensure survival, development, participation
and protection of children:

Lay special emphasis on vulnerable children and especially those belonging to the vulnerable
communities like SCs, STs, OBCs, migrants, slum dwellers, street dwellers and those with
disabilities.

Ensure effective implementation of the Right to Education, Right to Food Security Act.

Review, amend and strengthen the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act,
2012 and Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS).

Focused efforts will be made to address issue of anaemia.
Reduce the burden of books on children without compromising on the quality of education.
Endeavour to inculcate values amongst children.

Senior Citizens

BJP is committed to the welfare of senior citizens, especially their security and health care. We will
take measures to deal with the issues related to the senior citizens in a focused manner.

BJP will:

e Provide financial support, exploring ideas like additional tax benefits and higher interest rates.

e Investin setting up and improving old-age homes.
e Harness their experience in the National Interest. Devise schemes and programs to engage the

19

 

senior citizens as volunteers / part time workers in various development programmes of the

government, in urban and rural areas. This will not only help in utilizing their time, but also it would

be an effective utilization of their experience and may add an additional source of income for them.
Specially Abled

About 70 million people are suffering from disability, and BJP considers it a serious neglect. The
welfare and rehabilitation of disabled people is integral to our vision of a caring society and that of a
responsive government. The BUP commits to:

Enact the 'Rights of the Persons with Disabilities bill’ (RPWD).

Use technology to deliver low cost quality education to specially-abled students 'in-home' - through
E-learning.

Identify each and every special needs person across the country - establishing a web based
disability registration system to issue universal ID for all applicable government benefits (healthcare,
transportation, jobs, education etc).

Ensure disabled friendly access to public facilities, public buildings and transport.

Ensure maximum economic independence of the disabled by creating more income generation
models for them.

Support and aid voluntary organizations working for the care of the disabled.
Provide a higher tax relief for the family member taking care of the disabled.
Youth - Making India Unstoppable

‘Young men, my hope is in you. Will you respond to the call of your nation? Each one of you has a
glorious future if you dare believe me. Have a tremendous faith in yourselves, like the faith | had when
| was a child, and which | am working out now. Have that faith, each one of you, in yourself-that eternal
power is lodged in every soul-and you will revive the whole of the country.’ - Swami Vivekananda

 

BJP considers youth as the most productive asset of the nation who have played a key role in taking
the country to a near double digit growth. All sectors dominated by youth are doing exceptionally well.
India is the oldest civilization but the youngest country and this necessitates that the policies must be
based on the judicious mix of experience of energy, and be ""Youth inclusive’, so that youth are an
integral part of the development process. We commit to review and revise policies to seek participation
of youth in decision-making and nation building process and actively get the youth to participate in
decision-making bodies.

we will initiate the ""Young Leaders programme’ in all sectors, to recognize, reward and involve
these exceptionally talented youth to serve as role models and mentors for others.

set up the National Youth Advisory Council.

BJP will initiate nation-wide ‘district level incubation and accelerator programme’ for encouraging
innovation and entrepreneurship.

procedure to avail Student's loans will be simplified and loans made affordable.

Promotion of Sports
BJP recognizes the importance of sports in society and for all age groups. Sports have a direct relation
to fitness, good health and productivity. India has not fared well in sports, and needs to invest for
promotion of sports in an organized manner.

BJP will promote all sports - traditional and modern.

More funds will be allocated to sports, and we will encourage the State Governments to fully
discharge their responsibility in the promotion of sports.

Steps would be taken to inculcate a culture of sports at the school level by arranging sports
facilities and training needs for promoting a healthy lifestyle, and making sports as a compulsory
part of the school curriculum.

Launch a ‘National Sports Talent Search System’, so that extraordinary sporting talent is identified
at a very young age. Such promising boys and girls will be selected for special training. The
existing rural sports programme and National Women Sports Festival will be broadened to reach
every village and to identify talent for nurturing and excellence development.

Attractive career path needs to be planned for sportspersons providing security of career through
jobs in government, PSUs and private sector.

Establish sports academies across the country.
Special scheme would be devised for sportspersons to ensure social security.
Encourage business houses to patronize sports and sportspersons.

Mandate all new housing colonies to include sports facilities.
Women - The Nation Builder

 

BJP recognizes the important role of women in development of the society and growth of the nation,
and remains committed to give a high priority to Women's Empowerment and welfare. BUP ruled
states have demonstrated this through various schemes. BJP also recognizes the need for women's
security as a precondition to women's empowerment and will undertake the following for women welfare:

e Women's welfare and development will be accorded a high priority at all levels within the government,
and BJP is committed to 33% reservation in parliamentary and state assemblies through a
constitutional amendment.

Launch a national campaign for saving the girl child and educating her - Beti Bachao - Beti
Padhao.

Structure a comprehensive scheme, incorporating best practices from past successes like Balika
Samruddhi, Ladli Laxmi and Chiranjeevi Yojana to support encourage positive attitude amongst
families towards the girl child.

in other ITls.

Strict implementation of laws related to women, particularly those related to rape.

Fund for relief and rehabilitation of rape victims lies unused at the Centre as the Government has
not worked out the modalities of dispensation. BUP will clear this on priority.

Appropriate measures would be taken to check female foeticide, dowry, child marriage, trafficking,
sexual harassment, rape and family violence.

We will transform the quality of life of women in Rural India by providing electricity, tapped water,
cleaner fuel and toilets in every home.

Education - Enroll and Excel

BJP believes that education is the most powerful tool for the advancement of the nation and the most
potent weapon to fight poverty. Education in India needs to be revitalized and reorganized to make
future generations proud of their culture, heritage and history and also for creating confidence in the
vitality of India. Every effort shall be made to ensure ‘equality of opportunity in access and success' to
all learners; creating a harmonious, and cohesive egalitarian society that practices democratic values.
This would be possible only when Education accords due emphasis on national integration, social
cohesion, religious amity, national identity and patriotism. It must also be analyzed how far education
has contributed to moral, ethical and humanistic values in the individuals and the society.

 

Education must create minds free from superstitions, hatred and violence and become an important
vehicle to cement national unity, social cohesion and religious amity. Our endeavour should be to
inculcate moral, ethical and humanistic values in the individuals and the society.

India has to become a knowledge society and has to reverberate with educated skilled manpower of
high standards required to meet the challenges of 21st century. This requires a bold and visionary
leadership to introduce appropriate policy and structural changes.

Highest priority would be given to address the acute shortage of teachers and researchers, quality of
education and research, and also the employability factor associated with most of the courses. Education
should not only lead to employability but also job creation and entrepreneurship by introducing a
national multi-skills orientation program.

22

BJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014

BJP

We intend to review and revise education system; the salary structures associated with the teaching
staff and most importantly, address the shortfall of faculty and related issues in the country. The
system shall be made people-friendly and the credibility of the system shall be restored.

Investment in education yields the best dividend. Public spending on education would be raised to 6%
of the GDP, and involving the private sector would further enhance this.

Under the scheme of ‘Quality education for all', BJP would take the following steps;

School Education

e NDA's flagship program 'Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’: Mechanism would be set up for its performance
audit and to have real time information about its performance. Programme shall be strengthened
and expanded with a goal to remove illiteracy.

Universalization of secondary school education and skills development through functional school
shall be seriously pursued with particular focus on rural, tribal and difficult areas.

The content and process of school education shall be thoroughly reviewed to make it dynamic,
stress-free, attractive and responsive to the emerging national needs.

Girls shall be provided all possible help to continue and complete school education.

The digital divide shall not be allowed to create further divisions in the learning situations of children.
Special pedagogy would be developed for differently-abled students.

On priority, a national modernization programme for madrasa's would be started.

would also entail use of technology for education as a mission mode project.

Establish a national E-Library to empower school teachers and students.

Initiate a multi-country student exchange programme for broadening the horizon of school going
children.

e Creative talents of students will be recognized and encouraged.
Higher and Professional Education

The basic objective of higher and professional education is not only rapid advancement of the affluent
sector of the society but also to improve the lot of the last man in the line.

The content should be designed to prepare the students to understand the current challenges and
equip themselves to be able to readily adjust in a fast changing global scenario. Policy interventions
would include:

enhancing the pivotal role of the teachers by reworking the work culture of teacher training institutions
with a goal to prepare committed and performing teachers.

optimum utilization of physical and manpower resources.

a mechanism for close interaction between industry (including SME), academia and community
would be instituted.

UGC will be restructured and it will be transformed into a Higher Education Commission rather
than just being a grant distribution agency.

we will revisit the Apprenticeship Act to facilitate our youth to Earn while they Learn.
Vocational Training

entrepreneurship and innovation, and these courses would be provided for free to women. The goal
would be to prepare the youth for jobs being created by the emerging sectors, foster a spirit of
innovation and entrepreneurship, leading to more incomes and job creation.

BJP will set up a National Commission on Education to report in two years on the state of education
and the reforms needed. Based on the report, BJP will implement a National Education Policy to meet
the changing dynamics of the population's requirement with regards to quality education, innovation
and research, aiming to make India a knowledge superpower by equipping its students with the necessary
skills and knowledge and to eliminate the shortage of manpower in science, technology, academics
and industry.

Skills - Focusing on Productivity and Employability

 

Skillful hands, bright minds, discipline and perseverance makes Indian talent an asset worldwide. We
have to live up to this potential, preparing the World's Largest Workforce. We have to make our
youth productively employed and gainfully engaged. We also have to develop India as a Knowledge
Powerhouse. We have to train and nurture our human resource. We have to use it for leap-frogging
our Nation into the future. Unfortunately, the initiatives taken by Congress for this have fallen woefully
short, being almost non-starters.

We will take up skill development on a mission mode, at an unprecedented scale.

e Skill Mapping - to help scientifically plan our national human resource development that India
would need (like engineers, architects, doctors, nurses, lawyers, accountants, plumbers, carpenters,
welders, etc.).

Launch a ‘National Multi-skill Mission’
We will run short-term courses, in the evenings, focusing on employable skills.
We will also set up Centres of Excellence in various sectors in partnership with the Industry.

Health Services - Increase the Access, Improve the Quality, Lower the Cost

India needs a holistic care system that is universally accessible, affordable and effective and drastically
reduces the out of pocket spending on health. NRHM has failed to meet the objectives and will be
radically reformed. BJP accords high priority to health sector, which is crucial for securing the economy.

The overarching goal of healthcare would be to provide, 'Health Assurance to all Indians and to reduce
the out of pocket spending on health care’, with the help of state governments.

The current situation calls for radical reforms in the healthcare system with regards to national healthcare
programs and delivery, medical education and training and financing of healthcare. Our government

 

would focus on the following reforms in healthcare:

e the last healthcare policy dates back to 2002. India now needs a comprehensive healthcare policy
to address the complex healthcare challenges, keeping in view the developments in the healthcare
sector and the changing demographics. BJP will initiate the New Health Policy.

initiate the 'National Health Assurance Mission’, with a clear mandate to provide universal healthcare
that is not only accessible and affordable, but also effective, and reduces the OOP spending for
the common man.

Economic Revival

When the NDA Government completed its tenure the baton was handed over to the incoming UPA
Government with GDP growth nearing double digit in 2004. Inflation was under control. Fiscal Deficit
and Current Account Deficit were kept within limit and the overall Economy was showing robust
fundamentals. In contrast, now at the end of Congress-led UPA regime, the GDP growth has plummeted
to very low of 4.8%, the inflation and price rise beyond control, the fiscal deficit and current account
deficit in the alarm zone, and the manufacturing sector facing a recession. The Congress-led UPA has
indulged in massive scams during its last five years. In recent years, the Indian Rupee has seen a free
fall like never before.

This is basically the result of policy and decision paralysis of the UPA Government. Decisions are
simply not taken. And if they are taken, they turn into scandals. All this has destroyed the reputation
of our economy. To reverse this process, the first thing, which is required, is to restore confidence in

the non-banking financial companies to protect the investors.

Taxation

UPA Government has unleashed 'Tax terrorism’ and ‘uncertainty’, which not only creates anxiety amongst
the business class and negatively impacts the investment climate, but also dents the image of the
country. BUP realizes the importance of having a Tax Policy Roadmap, so that people are aware of the

future and plan accordingly. We will:
e provide anon adversarial and conducive tax environment

bodies.
Industry - Modern, Competitive and Caring

We should no longer remain a market for the global industry. Rather, we should become a Global
Manufacturing Hub. We have to encourage our industry to innovate and collaborate internationally. We
have to encourage industry to produce efficiently and cost-effectively.

Economic freedom implies that Government will not get in the way of the freedom of individuals to start
and operate legitimate businesses. Increased economic freedom will break open the economic space
to new entrants, especially in the form of small and medium-enterprises, creating jobs and prosperity.
Particularly:

We will ensure that a conducive, enabling environment is created making ‘doing business’ in
India easy.

We will focus on cutting the red tape, simplifying the procedures and removing the bottle-
necks.

We will ensure logistics infrastructure, including stable power.
Our attempt will be to move towards a single-window system of clearances both at the centre
and also at the State level through a Hub-spoke model.

We will put in place a mechanism that will ensure that the Central and state governments work in
close coordination and synergy while giving clearances to mega projects.

 

Decision-making on environment clearances will be made transparent as well as time-bound.
We will set up World class Investment and Industrial regions as Global Hubs of Manufacturing.

We will set up a task force to review and revive our MSME sector (Micro and Small Medium scale
Enterprises); enabling it with better access to formal credit and technology for modernization.

Frame the environment laws in a manner that provides no scope for confusion and will lead to
speedy clearance of proposals without delay.

Manufacturing

Astrong manufacturing sector will not only bridge the demand-supply gap leading to price stabilization,
but also create millions of jobs and increase incomes for the working class. Above all, it will
increase the revenue for government and lead to import substitution to bring down the import bill.
We will make India a hub for cost-competitive labour-intensive mass manufacturing. To give boost
to manufacturing, BJP will:

Accord high priority to the growth of manufacturing, so that we can create enough jobs in the
country. This sector must grow fast to ensure employment and asset creation.

Take steps for Interest rate rationalization and have a clear tax policy to remove uncertainty and
create investor confidence.

Take all steps; like removing red-tapism involved in approvals, to make it easy to do business,
invest in logistics infrastructure, ensure power supply and undertake labour reforms, besides other
steps to create a conducive environment for investors.

Increase the public spending on R&D and Incentivize R&D investments by the industry to increase
the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector.

We will facilitate setting up of software and hardware manufacturing units.

29

BJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014

Encourage Indian companies to go global and we will support Indian companies in this endeavor.
We believe that Indian entrepreneurs have the capability to take on global markets.

Set up trade facilitation to ensure easier customs clearances and visas for business travel.
Initiate a Government - Industry Dialogue, a channel for regular interface with the industry.

MSMEs (Micro, small and medium enterprises)

BJP considers that the role of SME sector is crucial for the economic development of our country. The
sector needs to be developed by providing international linkages for exports, availability of credit through
a dedicated SME bank, supply chain efficiencies, adoption of IT, support in R&D and innovation, and a
policy support for enhancing the mandate to purchase from SME for large scale projects. Overall goal
is to enhance the competitiveness of the SME sector leading to a larger contribution to our economic
growth and employment generation.

Cooperative Sector

Every effort will be made to encourage the cooperative sector. BJP commits to review the existing laws
with regards to the cooperative sector, and will amend the multi-state cooperative act to remove
lacunae and anomalies.

Handicrafts
We will move up the value chain of the sector driven by a focus on Quality.

e Market linkages - both national and international
e Access to credit and information and skills upgradation
e Value addition will be encouraged through avenues like - branding, packaging and technology.

Artisans
Schemes will be drawn for skills upgradation and enhancement of business opportunities for artisans
like smiths, weavers, carpenters, hair-dressers, shoe-smiths, and potters.

Services - Driven by Quality and Efficiency
Business and Trade

 

The modern era is an era of exchange. Over-regulation needs to be addressed to stop the harassment
of the businessmen and traders. At the same time, we have to set up transparent systems, which
ensure credibility of our goods and services. At the same time, the bottlenecks in transporting and
exporting them have to be removed. Also, the flow of information about our tradable items has to be
made available to the rest of the world.

Focus on Zero defect products.

Build world class Ports; connecting them with roads and rail to the hinterland so as to drive the
maritime trade of the country.

Air Cargo facilities will be enhanced throughout the country.
An Export Promotion Mission will be established integrating all stakeholders.

Current accounts deficit will be brought down aggressively by focusing on exports and reducing
the dependency on imports. Value addition on our products will be the biggest task.

We shall work with the State governments to usher in the GST in an appropriate timeframe. For
implementing the same, a robust IT network system will be put in place.

We will embark on the path of IPRs and Patents in a big way.

BJP

Take all necessary steps to protect the interest of retailers, small traders and small vendors and
equip them with the latest techniques and methods to modernize them and make them competitive.

Commit to ensure that the retailers and SMEs don't have to spend time and money for seeking
multiple licenses to start the business. There will a system in place to avoid harassment of small
traders.

Ensure easy availability of institutional credit.
Review obsolete and multiple laws to reduce and simplify them.
Remove ambiguity in rules to make way for prompt decisions without any scope for discretion.

Telecom revolution has touched length and breadth of the country but there is significant scope
and necessity to improve the quality of voice and data to fully leverage the potential.

Tourism - Untapped Potential

BJP recognizes the role tourism and hospitality can play as a foreign exchange earner and its ability
to create millions of jobs every year. Tourism plays a key role in socio-economic progress through
creation of jobs, enterprise, infrastructure development, and foreign exchange earnings.

BJP realizes that the tourism sector needs a clear plan for growth, and BJP commits to initiate a
mission mode project to create 50 tourist circuits that are affordable and built around themes like: a.)
Archaeological and Heritage, b.) Cultural and Spiritual, c.) Himalayan, d.) Desert, e.) Coastal, f.)
Medical (Ayurveda and Modern Medicine), etc. This will lead to creation of infrastructure and employment
around each tourist circuit and help in boosting revenue generation.

Specialized course in tourism will be started for capacity development. Safety and Security of tourists
would be accorded due priority.

Labour Force - The Pillar of Our Growth
BJP recognizes the fact that the labour is the key to the revival of the economy and so are the laws

governing them. We believe in promoting a harmonious relationship between labour and the industry,
with both playing an important contributory role in economic growth and development.

We will ensure that the interests of labour in the unorganized sector are protected.

For the organized labour, we propose to encourage industry owners and labour to embrace the concept
of Industry Family’. This concept, in which industry owners and labours bond as a family, is guided by
the principles of efficiency, skill development and upgradation, productivity, appropriate wages and
perquisites, and security towards this end. We will:

e issue identity cards to the unorganized sector labourers, and arrangements will be made to provide
them good quality health and education services. Also, their skills will be upgraded through
appropriate training programs.

extend access to modern financial services to labour - including considering the option of setting
up a dedicated Workers Bank.

bring together all stakeholders to review our Labour laws which are outdated, complicated and
even contradictory.

strengthen the Pension and Health Insurance safety nets for all kinds of labourers.
Housing - No Longer a Mirage

 

 

We will roll out a massive Low cost Housing programme to ensure that by the time the nation

31

BJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014

completes 75 years of its Independence, every family will have a pucca house of its own. It will be an
innovatively designed scheme that dovetails various existing programmes and also encourages the
housing sector by appropriate policy interventions and credit availability including interest subventions,
where necessary.

Our proposed programme will further ensure that these houses are equipped with the basic facilities of
toilet, piped water supply, electricity and proper Access. To do this we will amongst others:

Prioritize all our resources towards this goal.
Leverage on land as a resource in urban areas and demand for unskilled labour in the rural areas.
Innovatively structure the programme to converge and dovetail various existing programmes, while
adding the missing links.
Simultaneously encourage the overall housing sector, through appropriate policy interventions and
credit availability and interest subvention schemes.

Physical Infrastructure - Better than the Best

India should no longer be limited by its infrastructure. In fact, we have to create robust infrastructure,
which drives growth. For this purpose, we have to devote ourselves for a decade. We have to think big.
Also, looking to the expansion in our population as well as social and economic activities, we have to
build our infrastructure in a futuristic way. Growth of this sector means the growth of cement, steel,
electricity and many other associated industries and directly leads to massive job creation. To achieve
this, we will take following steps.

Work on the Freight Corridors and attendant Industrial Corridors will be expedited. This will
result in the faster movement of people and goods.

Remote states like those in the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir will be connected with the
rest of India through world class highways and rail lines.

National Highway construction projects will be expedited, especially Border and Coastal highways.

 

Every village will be connected through all-weather roads.

We shall modernize existing and operational Airports, and build new ones especially connecting
smaller towns and all tourism circuits. In addition, there is a potential for inland air transportation
to various remote and local locations in the country. Such air strips will be developed so that low
cost air travelling becomes possible within the country.

We will evolve an economic model of Port-led development. India is blessed with a long coastline.
We will modernize existing ports on one hand, and develop new ones on the other - stringing
together our Sagar Mala project.

Public Private Partnership would be encouraged to tap into private sector resources as well as
expertise. An institutional framework would be established for the same; while regulators
would be given greater autonomy as well as accountability.

Next Generation Infrastructure

We will:

e setup Gas Grids to make gas available to households and industry.

e setup a National Optical-Fibre Network up to the village level; and Wi-Fi zones in public areas.
e harness our advanced satellite technology and expertise for development.

Transport

The BJP realizes the importance of travel for the vibrancy of the economy and social unity. BUP will:

Create a public transport system, which can reduce the dependence on personal vehicles for
transport, thereby, reducing cost, time to travel as well as ecological cost.

Launch an Integrated Public transport project which will include roadways, railways and waterways.
Develop waterways for passenger and cargo transport.
Develop National logistics network for faster movement of goods.

Railway

Indian Railways is the lifeline of the country. It will be modernized, strengthened and upgraded to serve
passengers as well as the country's economy. This will be done in a planned manner focusing on
national development, rather than political exigency.

e Hinterland will be connected to the ports through strategic new Rail networks.

e Agri Rail network will be established - with Train Wagons designed to cater to the specific needs
of perishable Agricultural products like milk and vegetables as well as light weight wagons for salt
movement.

Tourist Rail - including Pilgrimage Rail.

warning systems.

Modernize and equip all stations with requisite infrastructure and public utilities.

Convert all unmanned crossings into manned crossings in a phased manner.

Initiate R&D for indigenous railways, coach design and signals.

We will launch Diamond Quadrilateral project - of High Speed Train network (bullet train).
Water - Make It Reach to All Homes, Farms and Factories

 

Trends indicate that India would be a 'water stressed’ state by 2050, and the gap between the demand
and supply would be 50%. BJP recognizes the seriousness of the issue. Also, most importantly,
potable drinking water is not available to the entire population despite more than six decades of
independence. Water is a dwindling resource, with the threat of water scarcity looming large. We will
address this in a comprehensive manner across multiple dimensions. BJP remains committed to
giving high priority to water security.

e Launch the 'Pradhan Mantri Gram Sinchayee Yojana’ with a motto of ‘har khet ko paani'. We will
launch multi-pronged 'water strategy' for reducing farmer's dependence on monsoon. Increase
irrigated land by completing the long pending irrigation projects on priority.

We will nurture ground water recharge harnessing rain water to reduce dependence on ground
water.

Encourage efficient use, water conservation, recycling and rain water harvesting.
Sewage treatment plants to prevent the pollution of rivers.

To ensure drinking water security to all. We will:

Encourage setting up of drinking water supply grid in water scarce areas.

Promote decentralized, demand-driven, community-managed water resource management, water
supply and environmental sanitation.

Facilitate piped water to all households.
Energy - Generate More, Use Rationally, Waste Less

BJP realizes the need to focus on generation and distribution of power as a national security issue, so
that the growth is not negatively impacted due to supply issues in the energy sector. The overarching
goal of energy security is to ensure affordable energy for various consumer segments. Steps will be
taken to avoid over- dependence on any one fuel and ensure supplier diversity, to avoid reliance on one
supplier, country and developing indigenous capacities to meet the emerging needs.
BJP will:

Come out with a responsible and comprehensive ‘National Energy Policy’.

Focus on development of energy infrastructure, human resource development and upgradation of
technology.

Take steps to maximize the potential of oil, gas, hydel power, ocean, wind, coal and nuclear
sources. BJP considers energy efficiency and conservation crucial to energy security.

Set up small-hydro power generation projects to harness the hydropower that is not being used at
the moment. Small projects can be set up with local support and without displacement of the local
population.

Take Steps to increase the domestic coal exploration and production, to bridge the demand and
supply gap. Oil and gas explorations would also be expedited in the country. This will also help to
reduce the import bill.

Give a thrust to renewable sources of energy as an important component of India's energy mix.
Expand and strengthen the national solar mission.

Science and Technology - India Innovates and India Leads

 

 

India has been a knowledge economy and has been a leader in science and technology from the
ancient times. India now needs policies and programs to reclaim its global leadership position in
science and technology. BJP recognizes the need to create an ecosystem for fundamental research
and innovation, keeping the objective of science with a human face in the service of the common man.
Science and technology has enormous potential to bridge the disparities between the urban and rural
India, rich and poor. Scientific education and technology needs to be encouraged, promoted, practiced
and leveraged with renewed vision and vigour.

BJP recognizes the central role of science and technology in raising the quality of life of the people of
the country, particularly of the disadvantaged sections of society in creating wealth for all, in making
India globally competitive, in utilizing natural resources in a sustainable manner, in protecting the
environment and ensuring national security. We will also encourage and incentivize private sector
investments - both domestic and foreign, in science and technology and in high-end research aimed

also socially and economically. Our science and technology policy will be framed and implemented so
as to be in harmony with our worldview of the large human family. We will ensure that science and
technology truly uplifts the Indian people and indeed all humanity.

Flora, Fauna and Environment - Safeguarding Our Tomorrow

The present generation has to make this world a better place to live. Abetter place not only for us, but
for our future generations as well. We have to nurture the environment, institutions, people, resources
and amenities. We have to combine the past, the present and the future. We have to have a holistic
view of human life for sustainable development.

 

We have to develop the assets and amenities for ourselves in a manner that leaves an equally good or
even better environment for the future generations. We will put sustainability at the centre of our
thoughts and actions, working on the principle that inclusive growth cannot be limited by the barriers of
time and space - it has to be built on the foundations of the past, leverage on the opportunities of the
present, and preserve and enhance its resources for the future. We will take Climate Change mitigation
initiatives with all seriousness and work with the global community and institutions in this regard.

We will:
e Encourage Cleaner production.

which most of the rivers in North India originate.

Natural & National Resources - Use When Required, Protect Where Necessary

Indian belief has been best encapsulated in Gandhiji's words that ""there is enough for everyone's need
- but not for everyone's greed"". Need is not the issue. Greed is. A country's progress depends upon its
resources and how they are harnessed and protected. Those in power have to realize they are just
trustees of the resources of the nation. The resources are neither meant for them nor for their masters.
If we bring this basic shift in thinking of the Government, which Mahatma Gandhi also advocated, all
problems will be resolved.

In recent years, it has been noticed that country's tangible and intangible resources have been looted
with impunity. The adverse result is being felt on two sides: Firstly, the proceeds of the resources have
not gone to the public exchequer. Secondly, because of this culture of usurping, the same resources
are not available for public purposes. The management of natural resources is marred with either
misappropriation or misallocation. This has to be set right.

e Wewwill set in place national policies on critical natural resources like coal, minerals, spectrum,
etc. - spelling out in black and white how much should be utilized at what time and pace; how this
should be strategically phased out to ensure sustainability; who should be allotted what responsibility
of extraction and at what cost.

 

State Governments will be taken into confidence for harnessing of these resources.

We will implement auction of precious resources through efficient mechanisms including e-
auction.

Resource mapping, exploration and management will be undertaken through the use of technology.
Value addition will be encouraged in all resources, instead of just marketing.
Secure Indians - Zero Tolerance on Terrorism, Extremism and Crime

Comprehensive national security is not just about borders, but in its broad terms includes military
security; economic security; cyber security; energy, food and water and health security; and social
cohesion and harmony. To effectively address the issues of national security, we need to address the
issues of - human resources, science and technology, system of governance and money.

 

National security cannot be compartmentalized based on one of issues but needs a clear roadmap to
address it. Over the past decade, lack of a strong and visionary leadership, coupled with multiple
power centres, has failed to address the issue of national security, leading to a chaotic situation and
denting India's image in the international arena.

India has a sensitive neighbourhood and there are internal security issues. There have been intrusions
inside the LAC (Line of actual control), loss of squadrons of combat aircraft by the air force, witnessing
of a series of accidents by the Navy, leading to a loss in its combating capability built over many
decades, communal riots, Maoist attacks, increase in incidence of Pakistan backed terror groups in

37

BJP ELECTION MANIFESTO 2014
Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat

 

India, illegal immigration across the eastern border, and racists' attacks in the national capital. All
these are indications of surrendering of India's interest. This calls for a review and overhauling of the
current system. With the financial situation worsening, the issue of national security can acquire a
horrifying dimension.

BJP recognizes the importance of identifying a clear roadmap to address the issue head-on, with
radical systemic changes.

Internal Security

BJP will:

immigration.

Defence Production

With its skilled human resources and technical talent, India can emerge as a global platform for
defence hardware manufacture and software production. BJP will strengthen the Defence Research
and Development Organization (DRDO); encourage private sector participation and investment, including
FDI in selected defence industries.

Technology transfer in defence manufacturing will be encouraged to the maximum.
We will find solutions to the problems hampering the growth of the defence sector.

We will encourage domestic industry to have a larger share in design and production of military
hardware and platforms for both domestic use and exports, in a competitive environment.

Independent Strategic Nuclear Programme

BJP believes that the strategic gains acquired by India during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime on the
nuclear programme have been frittered away by the Congress. Our emphasis was, and remains on,
beginning of a new thrust on framing policies that would serve India's national interest in the 21st
century. We will follow a two-pronged independent nuclear programme, unencumbered by foreign
pressure and influence, for civilian and military purposes, especially as nuclear power is a major
contributor to India's energy sector.

BJP will:

e Study in detail India's nuclear doctrine, and revise and update it, to make it relevant to challenges
of current times.

e Maintain a credible minimum deterrent that is in tune with changing geostatic realities.
e Invest in India's indigenous Thorium Technology Programme.

Foreign Relations - Nation First, Universal Brotherhood

BJP believes a resurgent India must get its rightful place in the comity of nations and international
institutions. The vision is to fundamentally reboot and reorient the foreign policy goals, content and
process, in a manner that locates India's global strategic engagement in a new paradigm and ona
wider canvass, that is not just limited to political diplomacy, but also includes our economic, scientific,
cultural, political and security interests, both regional and global, on the principles of equality and
mutuality, so that it leads to an economically stronger India, and its voice is heard in the international
fora.

 

BJP believes that political stability, progress and peace in the region are essential for south Asia's
growth and development. The Congress-led UPA has failed to establish enduring friendly and cooperative

39

relations with India's neighbours. India's relations with traditional allies have turned cold. India and its
neighbours have drifted apart. Instead of clarity, we have seen confusion. The absence of statecraft has
never been felt so acutely as today. India is seen to be floundering, whereas it should have been
engaging with the world with confidence. The collapse of the Indian economy has contributed to the
sorry state of foreign affairs in no small measure.

We will build a strong, self-reliant and self-confident India, regaining its rightful place in the comity of

nations. In this, we will be firstly guided by our centuries old tradition of ayaa BSA. At the same
time, our foreign policy will be based on best National interests. We will create a web of allies to
mutually further our interests. We will leverage all our resources and people to play a greater role on
the international high table.

India has long failed to duly appreciate the full extent and gamut of its soft power potential. There is
a need to integrate our soft power avenues into our external interchange, particularly, harnessing and
focusing on the spiritual, cultural and philosophical dimensions of it. India has always played a major
role in world affairs, offering a lot to the World. This has been its tradition since time immemorial. The
magnetic power of India has always been in its ancient wisdom and heritage, elucidating principles
like harmony and equity. This continues to be equally relevant to the world today in today's times of
Soft power. We will adopt Proactive Diplomacy to spread the same. India was reckoned not only as
Vishwaguru but also a vibrant trading society. Our ancestors used to trade with foreign nations through
the routes of sea, centuries ago. This was based on the strength of our business acumen and integrity,
our products and crafts. The symbols of our ancient civilizations stand as a testimony to our architectural
and urban planning excellence. We will revive Brand India with the help of our strengths of 5 T's:
Tradition, Talent, Tourism, Trade and Technology.

Guiding Principles of our Foreign Policy will be:

Equations will be mended through pragmatism and a doctrine of mutually beneficial and interlocking
relationships, based on enlightened national interest.

We will champion uniform international opinion on issues like Terrorism and Global Warming.

Instead of being led by big power interests, we will engage proactively on our own with countries in
the neighbourhood and beyond.

In our neighbourhood we will pursue friendly relations. However, where required we will not
hesitate from taking strong stand and steps.

We will work towards strengthening Regional forums like SAARC and ASEAN.

We will continue our dialogue, engagement and cooperation, with global forums like BRICS, G20.

IBSA, SCO and ASEM. States will be encouraged to play a greater role in diplomacy; actively

building relations with foreign countries to harness their mutual cultural and commercial strengths.
Also,

We will expand and empower our pool of diplomats, ensuring our message is taken to the world
and our great nation represented on the whole in a befitting manner.

The NRIs, PlOs and professionals settled abroad are a vast reservoir to articulate the national
interests and affairs globally. This resource will be harnessed for strengthening Brand India.
India shall remain a natural home for persecuted Hindus and they shall be welcome to seek refuge
here.

Cultural Heritage

Ram Mandir: BJP reiterates its stand to explore all possibilities within the framework of the constitution
to facilitate the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

 

Ram Setu: Ram Setu is a part of our cultural heritage and also of strategic importance due to its vast
thorium deposits. These facts will be taken into consideration while taking any decision on 'Sethu-
Samudram Channel' project.

Ganga: River Ganga is a symbol of faith in India, and has a special place in the Indian psyche. It is
Mukti dayini. In addition it is also Jivan dayini for the parts of the country it flows. People and cattle
depend on it for agriculture, fodder and drinking water. Pure water of the Ganga are thus essential for
the spiritual as well as physical well being of India.

Unfortunately however, even after decades of independence, the Ganga continues to be polluted and is
drying. BJP commits to ensure the cleanliness, purity and uninterrupted flow of the Ganga on priority.
In addition, a massive 'Clean Rivers Programme' will be launched across the country driven by
people's participation.

Cow and its Progeny: In view of the contribution of cow and its progeny to agriculture, socio-economic
and cultural life of our country, the Department of Animal Husbandry will be suitably strengthened and
empowered for the protection and promotion of cow and its progeny.

e Necessary legal framework will be created to protect and promote cow and its progeny.

e ANational Cattle Development board will be set up to implement a Programme for the improvement
of indigenous livestock breeds.

Heritage Sites: We will provide appropriate resources for the maintenance and restoration of all
national heritage sites, and to prevent their vandalisation in any form. The digitization of archives and
archeological and museological records would be initiated. A National Mission for beautifying and
improving the infrastructure and amenities at pilgrimage centres of all faiths will be launched.

Languages: Indian Languages are repositories of our rich literature, history, culture, art and scientific
achievements. Many of our dialects are important source for knowing our heritage. BP would promote
Indian languages, and put measures for the development of all Indian languages, so that they become
a powerful vehicle for creating a knowledge society.

Uniform Civil Code

 

Article 44 of the constitution of India lists Uniform Civil Code as one of the Directive Principles of state
policy. BUP believes that there cannot be gender equality till such time India adopts a Uniform Civil
Code, which protects the rights of all women, and the BJP reiterates its stand to draft a Uniform Civil
Code, drawing upon the best traditions and harmonizing them with the modern times.

Conclusion - Amritmay Bharat

We aim to build a modern, prosperous and vibrant India - Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, based on our
ethos and values. We have to convert ourselves into a knowledge based society and economy, powered
by experience, tools of technology and energy of our people. BJP commits itself to this task and
promises to work relentlessly towards this goal, for which we are seeking sixty months.

In 2022, we will be celebrating 75 years of India's Independence. In Indian culture, this is celebrated as
Amrit Mahotsav. For us, every day and every step, every journey and every process will be dedicated
to make Amritmay Bharat. And all this will be done by all of us, for all of us!

This is not the time to sit back. This is the time when each of us has to get up and contribute our might
to bring the change.

Let's come together, vote BJP to make Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.

Jai Hind!
Vande Mataram!

TO BUILD A PROSPEROUS,
POWERFUL NATION,
RECALL INDIA’S PAST

Indian civilisation is perhaps the most ancient and continuing civilisation of
the world. India has a long history and has been recognised by others as a land of
great wealth and even greater wisdom. But India has also experienced continued
foreign attacks and alien rule for centuries and this has resulted in a loss of pride in
India and its remarkable achievements. Indians, particularly educated under the
system of education imposed by the Britishers, have lost sight of not only the cultural
and civilisational greatness of India, but also of its technological achievements and

abounding natural resources.

History tells us that India was a land of abundance. The country has been
blessed with great natural fertility, abundant water and unlimited sunshine.
According to foreigners visiting this country, Indians were regarded as the best
agriculturists in the world. Records of these travels from the 4° Century BC till early-
19"" Century speak volumes about our agricultural abundance which dazzled the
world. The Thanjaur (900-1200 AD) inscriptions and Ramnathapuram (1325 AD)
inscriptions record 15 to 20 tonnes per hectare production of paddy. Now, even
after the first green revolution, according to Government statistics, Ludhiana in the
late-20"" Century recorded a production of 5.5 tonnes of paddy per hectare. It is,
therefore, imperative that India rediscovers an agricultural technology which
incorporates all the inputs from our own wisdom and agricultural skills that made

us a land of abundance in food.

Indian economy was as flourishing as its agriculture. Foreigners from
Magasthenes to Fa-Hian and Hiuen-Tsiang have described and praised Indian
material prosperity. Indian villages around 1780 in Bihar have been cited as an
example of cleanliness and hospitality. The streets were swept and watered and the
people had a remarkable sense of hospitality and attention to accommodate the
needs of the travellers.

Old British documents established that India was far advanced in the technical
and educational fields than Britain of 18"" and early-19"" Century. Its agriculture

technically and productively was far superior; it produced a much higher grade of

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

iron and steel. The Iron Pillar at Mehrauli in Delhi has withstood the ravages of time
for 1,500 years or more without any sign of rusting or decay. Metallurgists of the world
have marvelled at this high degree of sophistication in technology. Textiles formed the
great industrial enterprise of pre-British India. Up to the late-18"" Century, India was

the leading producer and exporter of textiles; China was then a close second.

Indian advancements in astronomy, mathematics, chemistry, physics and
biological sciences have been documented and recognised all over the world.
Contributions in the field of medicine and surgery are also well known. Ayurveda and
Yoga are the best gifts from India to the world in creating a healthy civilisation. India
knew plastic surgery, practised it for centuries and, in fact, it has become the basis of
modern plastic surgery. India also practised the system of inoculation against small

pox centuries before the vaccination was discovered by Dr Edward Jenner.

Fa-Hian, writing about Magadha in 400 AD, has mentioned that a well organised
health care system existed in India. According to him, the nobles and householders of
this country had founded hospitals within the city to which the poor of all countries,
the destitute, the crippled and the diseased may repair. “They receive every kind of
requisite help. Physicians inspect their diseases, and according to their cases, order
them food and drink, medicines or decoctions, everything in fact that contributes to
their ease. When cured they depart at their ease.”

It has been established beyond doubt by the several reports on education at the
end of the 18"" Century and the writings of Indian scholars that not only did India have
a functioning indigenous educational system but that it actually compared more than
favourably with the system obtaining in England at the time in respect of the number
of schools and colleges proportionate to the population, the number of students in
schools and colleges, the diligence as well as the intelligence of the students, the quality
of the teachers and the financial support provided from private and public sources.
Contrary to the then prevailing opinion, those attending school and college included
an impressive percentage of lower caste students, Muslims and girls. Mahatma Gandhi
was absolutely right in saying that India was more illiterate in 1931 compared to its
state of literacy 50-60 years ago, i.e. in 1870. India had also an expertise in ship building,
as also in extensive manufacturing and uses of dyes, and also in manufacturing paper.

India had a share of about 22.5 per cent of world GDP in 1600 AD which
during British domination suffered a steep decline to 12.25 per cent in 1870, while the
British share in the same period rose sharply from 1.8 per cent to 9.1 per cent. When
Britishers left India, the economy was completely shattered and India’s share in world
manufacture, trade and GDP declined further. Even after 62 years of Independence,

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

SOr
India’s share in world market remains less than one per cent.

India’s prosperity, its talents and the state of its high moral society can be best
understood by what Thomas Babington Macaulay stated in his speech of February 02,
1835, in the British Parliament. “I have travelled across the length and breadth of
India and I have not seen one person who is a beggar, who is a thief, such wealth I
have seen in this country, such high moral values, people of such high caliber, that I
do not think we would ever conquer this country, unless we break the very back bone
of this nation, which is her spiritual and cultural heritage, and therefore, I propose
that we replace her old and ancient education system, her culture, for if the Indians
think that all that is foreign and English is good and greater than their own, they will
lose their self esteem, their native culture and they will become what we want them, a
truly dominated nation.” This policy was implemented very meticulously by Britishers
and the education system was created to make Indian’s ignorant about themselves.

No nation can chart out its domestic or foreign policies unless it has a clear
understanding about itself, its history, its strength and failings. It becomes all the more
important for any nation to know its roots which sustain its people in a highly mobile
and globalised world. Leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Sri
Aurobindo, Mahatma Gandhi and others who spearheaded the freedom movement
had built the struggle around a clear vision of India’s civilisational consciousness. Indian
ways of thought and action were in the centre of their political action. These leaders
had a vision to reconstruct the political and economic institutions of India as a
continuum of the civilisational consciousness which made India one country, one people
and one nation. It is unfortunate that the leaders of independent India quickly discarded
this vision and continued to work with the institutional structures created by the British
which had nothing to do with India’s world view and its vitality which were responsible
for its survival despite continued outside attacks and alien rule.

During the six decades of our independence, governance of our country, except
for a short period, was with the Congress and its associates. It was most unfortunate
that they never thought of creating a socio-economic and political paradigm of
governance drawing from the civilisational consciousness of India. They, instead, tried
to emulate whatever was being practised in this or that Western country. The disastrous

results are before us.

What was required after independence was to reorient India’s polity to bring it
in consonance with the seekings and sensibilities of the Indian people. Failure to do so
has resulted in a fractured society, vast economic disparities, terrorism and communal

conflict, insecurity, moral, psychological and spiritual degradation, and a state

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

apparatus unable to handle any of these problems. Attempts are sometimes made to
apply palliatives to manage the affairs but nothing succeeds. What is needed is to
arrive at a consensus about the ‘Idea’ of India and also about the seekings and
preferences of the people and how they find expression in various socio-economic,
political organisations and cultural, aesthetic and ethical sensibilities of the people of
India.

The civilisational consciousness of India has been well defined by the sages
and philosophers and has its roots in Bharatiya or Hindu world view. This world
view is holistic and spiritual. It accepts that diversity is inherent in the scheme of
creation; it is the manifestation of the same cosmic entity in different forms. Hence it
not only accepts diversity but respects it and even more celebrates it. Hindu or Bharatiya
view of life seeks unity in diversity. It is an inclusive approach and one can say that
Hinduism is the most ennobling experience in spiritual co-existence. The Bharatiya
mind has contemplated beyond national boundaries and the Vedic Rishi declared in
the hoary past ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbukam’ - that the world is a family. The horizons of
India’s worldview are known to have extended from Bamiyan / Kandahar to
Borobudur / Indonesia on the one hand, and Sri Lanka to Japan on the other. Imprints
of Indian culture are found in some other parts of the world as well. In ancient times
India was isolated in geography but not in cultural relationship, trade and commerce.

The belief in essential unity of mankind is a unique feature of Hindu thought.
The Vedic Rishi had also declared that ‘Ekam Sad Viprah Bahudha Vadanti (truth or
reality is one but wise men describe it in different ways). This is essentially a secular
thought in the real sense of the term because it accepts that one can follow his own
path to reach the ultimate. Hindus are well known for their belief in harmony of
religions. And because of this world view almost all religions practised in different
parts of the world have existed peacefully in India and will continue to do so.

But it appears that even after six decades of independence India has not been
able to discover its innate vitality and its sense of time and consequently has lost its
direction and will to act. The drift is acute and has encompassed all aspects of national
life. The situation needs a change and a new paradigm is called for, for creating a
prosperous, progressive and powerful India whose voice is heard in international
fora.

India can achieve this goal provided the people seriously set to this task. We
are endowed with vast human and material resources. Indian youth have
demonstrated their capabilities in various walks of life and proved their competence.
In science and technology, space and atomic energy, despite handicaps and lack of

world class facilities, they have done remarkably well. In industry, business and
management and information communication technology, they have successfully
taken challenging risks. With this energetic and vibrant youth power and by prudently
harnessing natural resources, Indians can perform miracles provided they work with
self-confidence and pride in India. We have to assure a prominent role and full
opportunities to our youth in the decision-making process. They are the future and
the propellers of our prosperity.

India need not blindly copy this or that model of development; it should evolve
a model suited to its genius and resources. The Integral Humanism suggested by Pt.
Deen Dayal Upadhyay provides such a model. India should be original, India should
innovate, and India should move upwards on the ladder of global leadership. The
global scenario demands a solution, a radical solution to save the world from the
impending disaster of the Great Economic Recession and terrorism looming large all
over the world. India is destined to play its historic role at this crucial juncture and for
this the BJP is committed to work for creating a modern, powerful, prosperous,
progressive and secure India.

quirk of fate brought the Congress to power at the Centre in the summer of 2004. The

United Progressive Alliance that it put together, which was able to secure parliamentary
majority with the help of the Left parties, has shown remarkable lack of cohesiveness with
individual Ministers representing the Congress’ allies running their allotted Ministries like their
personal fiefdom. This was a Government totally divorced from the twin principles of collective
responsibility and accountability.

The nation was thus burdened with a Prime Minister who was in office but not in power;
and, a Government that was in power but not in authority. This was supposed to be a Government
that would work for the welfare of the ‘aam admi’ - the common man. As it prepares to exit
office after five years, the Government has nothing to show by way of extending a ‘hand’ to the
‘aam admi’.

This Government will be remembered for four things. It was headed by the weakest
Prime Minister the country has ever had. Its reversal of NDA’s policies has led to a mounting
sense of insecurity fuelled by repeated terrorist attacks, Maoist insurgency and separatist violence
which together have claimed hundreds of innocent lives. Its gross mismanagement of the economy
has caused inflation, job losses and lockouts. And, it has shielded corruption at high places by
misusing agencies of the state, namely the CBI.

The Congress has tried to whitewash its terrible record on the national security front,
especially its abysmal failure to protect citizens from terrorism, by making cosmetic changes in
antiquated laws. This is clearly not enough. It has sought to gloss over the increasing cost of
food, which is eight per cent higher than in 2008, and many times more than in 2004, by projecting
misleading statistics.

Lakhs of people in the unorganised sector have lost their jobs over the past year. Skilled
workers are losing their jobs in the organised sector. This is far worse than unemployment
because it impoverishes families dependent on assured income and dampens the national spirit.

*

The worst hit are India’s youth, especially those who are looking forward to enter the
job market. The Congress-led UPA Government has gifted them with a bleak future.

As for the poor, they feel abandoned by the Congress-led regime. The much-publicised
National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme has turned out to be as much a flop as all
other schemes of the Government. It is a telling comment on the UPA’s performance that a

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

—O =

whopping 55 million people have been pushed below the poverty line over the past five years.
This is according to a study by the Indian Statistical Institute, based on data collated by the
National Sample Survey Organisation; the real figure could be much higher.

In rural India, thousands of farmers have committee suicide to escape the burden of
mounting debt and grinding poverty. They are victims of Government apathy.

An equally damning indictment of the Congress-led UPA regime is galloping urban
poverty. An estimated 23.7 per cent of the population in cities and towns lives in slums, according
to ‘India: Urban Poverty Report, 2009’, amid squalor, crime, disease and tension.

Such glaring deprivation and denial, such rising numbers of people below the poverty
line, contradict this nation’s aspirations. They are obstacles to India’s emergence as a great
power and need to be removed through remedial Government intervention.

The stability of the NDA years helped India to prosper. The drift of the UPA years has
put India in reverse gear. The BJP will restore the stability which India desperately needs.

*

The BJP, immediately upon coming to power, will address the key issues of security and
economy. It will resume the employment-generating, prosperity-creating policies of the NDA
Government headed by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, through massive investments in infrastructure
projects, by nursing agriculture back to health, and by making credit easily accessible to industry,
while ensuring the safety and security of all people from the depredations of terrorists.

India today faces a severe crisis of leadership. The nation needs a determined and decisive
leader who has the capacity, commitment and conviction to take command of the situation and
lead from the front. The country needs a leader who can restore Government's credibility and
the people’s confidence in themselves. The polity needs a leader who values consensus over
conflict, consultation over confrontation. Then alone can good governance replace the all-round
failure of the Congress.

That leader is Shri L.K. Advani.

Shri Advani has an exemplary record of service to the nation covering over six decades.
A leader of impeccable integrity, he was one of the chief crusaders for democracy during the
Emergency (1975-77) and spent 19 months in jail. He led the Ayodhya movement, the biggest
mass movement in India since Independence, and initiated a powerful debate on cultural
nationalism and the true meaning of secularism. Along with Shri Vajpayee, he was the principal
architect of the BJP’s triumph, as the head of the National Democratic Alliance, in forming a
stable and successful non-Congress coalition Government at the Centre (1998-2004). As India’s
Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, he ably assisted Shri Vajpayee in steering the ship
of the nation through difficult waters.

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

The BJP is proud that it is seeking the people’s mandate in the 2009 general election,
along with its allies in the NDA, under the leadership of Shri Advani.

*

The BJP is contesting the 2009 15"" Lok Sabha election on a Manifesto that commits the
party to an agenda for change guided by three goals: GOOD GOVERNANCE,
DEVELOPMENT and SECURITY. Our focus will be on the nation’s youth, on addressing their
concerns and helping them achieve their aspirations. We will lay emphasis on empowerment
through excellence by providing quality education. We will ensure the security of life and property.
Reviving the economy, re-orienting it towards agriculture, rural development, and unorganised
and informal sectors; creating adequate employment opportunities for the youth; pushing back
the price line; and, investing heavily in infrastructure projects are at the top of our agenda.

The BJP believes that after five years of drift and missed opportunities, the time has come
for a Government that works, a Government that cares. Our primary concern will be India’s
rapid, inclusive, equitable and all-embracing development and stable growth that benefits the
largest number of people. We will invest in rural development; we will ensure higher agricultural
productivity and guarantee an assured income to farmers; and, we will protect the livelihood of
the masses while creating myriad opportunities of gainful employment.

NATIONAL SECURITY
FEAR SHALL NO LONGER STALK THIS LAND

he last five years have been a nightmare for the people of this country as terrorists, separatists

and insurgents have led the effete UPA Government on a macabre dance of death and
destruction. From the daring attack on Delhi on the eve of Diwali in 2005 to the fidayeen raid
on the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, from the horrendous bombings in Hyderabad (including at
Mecca Masjid), Bangalore, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Guwahati to the slaughter of worshippers
at Sankat Mochan Temple in Banaras, the terrorists have struck repeatedly with impunity as
the Prime Minister spent sleepless nights agonising over the plight of terror suspects and eagerly
offered to reward the kith and kin of terrorists killed in action.

The UPA began its tenure by dismantling the anti-terror regime put together by the BJP-
led NDA Government: The Prevention of Terrorism Act was scrapped; investigations were
halted; and, prosecution was slowed down. The mastermind behind the daring attack on
Parliament House, Mohammed Afzal Guru, was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court
after being prosecuted under POTA. But a dissolute Government headed by an irresolute Prime
Minister has failed to carry out the execution, sending out a clear message to India’s enemies:
They shall not be punished till such time the Congress is in power.

It is, therefore, not surprising that terrorists should have repeatedly attacked our cities,
leaving behind a bloody trail of death and destruction. Delhi, the nation’s capital, and Mumbai,
the country’s financial capital, have been hit twice, as has been Bangalore, India’s technology
capital. As if the bombings of the commuter trains were not enough, the ISI despatched fidayeen
for a multiple strike on Mumbai which began on November 26, 2008, and lasted for more than
60 hours. Never before has India been seen to be so helpless in the face of terror.

Terrorism sponsored by Pakistani agencies is only one of the reasons behind the fear that
grips the people in cities, towns and villages. The life and limb of the ‘aam admi’ is equally in
danger on account of Maoists who have expanded their theatre of violence to 156 districts
across 13 States. The inter-State coordination mechanism put in place by the NDA Government
has been dismantled and State Governments have been virtually left to fend for themselves in
the face of mounting Maoist hostility. In Jammu & Kashmir, separatists continue to use the
services of Pakistani terrorists to promote their agenda of relentless violence. In the North-East,
insurgents have remorselessly killed and maimed innocent people. The situation in Assam is
particularly of concern as the ULFA, which had been all but smashed during the NDA years,
has regrouped and rearmed its cadres, and unleashed a relentless wave of terror. The Congress
State Government has done nothing to either prevent this violence or punish ULFA; instead,
unconditional talks have been offered to the killers!

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

Internal security is also imperilled by unchecked illegal immigration across our eastern
border. The vulnerability of these illegal immigrants has been time and again exploited by the
ISI and its jihadi front organisations as well as local terror cells to carry out bombings and
provide logistical support to foreign terrorists. The Supreme Court has described illegal
immigration as an act of ‘external aggression’ while striking down the IMDT Act. But the
Congress, both at the Centre and in Assam, has tried to circumvent the Supreme Court’s
judgement through executive orders. The Gauhati High Court last year lashed out at the State
Government for doing nothing to stop the illegal immigration. The High Court highlighted how
a Pakistani, who had entered Assam via Bangladesh, contested Assembly elections unchallenged.
Vote-bank politics has not only changed the demography of vast stretches of eastern and North-
East India but also eroded the authority of the state. India is sitting on a tinderbox. The
consequences of this unabated illegal immigration are bound to be disastrous.

In its dying days, the UPA Government has tried to fool the people by tampering with
outdated laws and setting up a National Investigating Agency to fight terror. But such half-
hearted efforts to calm anger and disquiet following the 26/11 outrage are neither enough nor
the right approach to tacking the menace of terrorism.

The BJP will initiate the following measures within 100 days of coming to power:

1. Revive the anti-terror mechanism that has been dismantled by the Congress; improve
upon POTA to ensure it is more effective as an instrument of deterrence and a tool to
prosecute offenders without innocent people being harassed; and, strengthen the
operational role of the National Investigating Agency.

2. Give assent to laws drafted by State Governments for dealing with organised crime and
terrorism; encourage other State Governments to adopt similar laws.

3. Launch a massive programme to detect, detain and deport illegal immigrants.

4. Completely revamp the internal and external intelligence agencies and review the existing
system of coordination, convergence and dissemination of intelligence inputs. A massive
exercise will be undertaken to modernise intelligence agencies so that they are better
equipped to use technology and cope with the rapidly changing trends and patterns of
terrorism at home and abroad. The National Security Council will be made the hub of all
sector-related assessments. It will be accountable for real-time intelligence dissemination;
intelligence agencies will be held responsible for lapses. Appointments to intelligence
agencies will be on merit and not because of political patronage as has been the system
during the Congress years.

5. A Digital Security Agency will be set up to deal with cyber warfare, cyber counter-
terrorism, and cyber security of national digital assets.

6. State Governments will be provided with all assistance to modernise their respective

police forces and equip them with the latest weaponry and communications technology.
This will be done on a mission mode approach. The police are the first responders to any
crisis situation. Drawing lessons from experience, police forces will be trained and fully
equipped to deal with situations similar to that of Mumbai and in meeting the challenge
posed by Maoists and insurgents.

Border management will be reviewed and improved. Punitive measures will be introduced
to block illegal immigration.

India’s vast coastline is virtually unprotected. Coastal security will be strengthened for
better patrolling of Indian waters and preventing terrorists from taking the sea route to
enter India. A National Maritime Authority will be set up to coordinate coastal security.

Special courts will be set up for speedy prosecution of those involved with acts of terrorism.
Their trial shall be fair and justice will be done to the victims swiftly.

Coercive measures, including diplomacy, will be used to deal with countries which
promote cross-border terrorism. India will engage with the world in the global war on
terror while not compromising on its domestic interests, primarily protecting citizens
from the ravages of terrorism.

The Centre will facilitate better inter-State coordination and real-time intelligence-sharing,
apart from helping States to raise anti-insurgency forces, to face the threat posed by
Maoists. The ‘Chhattisgarh Model’ will be used for counter-Maoist operations. At the
same time, every effort will be made to address the social and economic issues that make
the ground fertile for Left-wing extremism.

Any talks with insurgent groups will be conditional and within the framework of the
Constitution.

The BJP will send out a simple message, loud and clear, to terrorists and their sponsors:

They will have to pay a heavy price for each innocent life lost. Retribution will be swift and

exemplary. The authority of the state, which has been diminished by the Congress in pursuit of

vote-bank politics, shall be restored.

National Identity Cards for All

The BJP will launch an innovative programme to establish a countrywide system of

multipurpose national identity cards so as to ensure national security, correct welfare delivery,

accurate tax collection, financial inclusion and voter registration. Voter identity cards, PAN

cards, passports, ration cards and BPL cards are already in use though not all with photo

identity. The NDA proposes to make it incumbent for every Indian to have a National Identity
Card. The programme will be completed in three years.

The National Identity Card will contain enough memory and processing capabilities to

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

run multiple applications. Through it the NDA will ensure efficient welfare delivery and tax
collection. The card will also be linked to a bank account. All welfare payments, including
widow and old age pensions, through the wide range of schemes such as Mother and Child
support/ Kisan Credit, Students Assistance and Micro-Credit will be channelised through the
National Identity Card. The card will make it possible for individuals to save and borrow money;
for farmers to get bank credit, also establish accurate land titles data.

The National Identity Card will also strengthen national security by ensuring accurate
citizen identity, thus tracking illegal immigration. All financial transactions, purchase of property
and access to public services will be possible only on the basis of the National Identity Card
which will be made forgery and hacking resistant.

ENGAGING THE WORLD
INDIA’S VOICE SHALL BE HEARD

he BJP believes a resurgent India must get its rightful place in the comity of nations and

international institutions. The BJP also believes in a multi-polar world with no nation having
overriding powers over others. Towards this end, the BJP in power will engage in meaningful
diplomacy with nations across the world on equal terms. The BJP’s foreign policy will be based
on the principle of enlightened self-interest.

The BJP desires good relations between India and the USA and will strengthen the India-
US strategic partnership on the principle of equality. But we will not compromise on either
India’s national interest or relations with another friendly country. The BJP will restore the
balance that has been disturbed by the UPA Government.

India’s traditional relations with Russia and the Central Asian Republics will be
refashioned to keep pace with current realities and derive maximum mutual advantage.

We will pursue friendly relations with the European Union, West Asian countries and
South-East Asian nations. It will further strengthen relations with Arab countries and pursue
enhanced cooperation with Israel - the two are not inter-linked and both are beneficial for
India.

The dialogue process of solving the outstanding border dispute with China, which was
initiated by the NDA Government under Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s leadership, will be revived.
We believe that both India and China can prosper and rise together; increased economic
cooperation can contribute to this.

India has a special role to play in the Indian Ocean region and we will pursue this
vigorously.

The BJP believes in forging enduring friendly and cooperative relations with India’s
neighbours. We also believe that political stability, progress and peace in India’s neighbourhood
are essential for South Asia’s growth and development: SAARC is a good platform to promote
these goals.

But the BJP will be guided solely by national interest while dealing with India’s neighbours.
Towards this end, its decisions and actions in power will be determined by the following:

Pakistan: There can be no ‘comprehensive dialogue’ for peace unless Pakistan a)
dismantles the terrorist infrastructure on territory under its control; b) actively engages in
prosecuting terror elements and organisations; c) puts a permanent, verifiable end to its practice
of using cross-border terrorism as an instrument of state policy; d) stops using the territory of
third countries to launch terror attacks on India; and, e) hands over to India individuals wanted
for committing crimes on Indian soil.

Nepal: The BJP will re-craft India’s Nepal policy to rid it of the UPA’s biases that have
influenced India’s response to events in Nepal with which our country shares a common
civilisational and cultural history. India-Nepal relations must be based on friendship, mutual
cooperation and harmony of interests. Towards this end, existing arrangements will be reviewed
and revised bearing in mind mutual interests and benefits on the basis of dialogue. The BJP
would like to see Nepal emerge as a stable, prosperous country, and will strive to strengthen
age-old fraternal ties.

Bhutan: Existing close relations with Bhutan will be strengthened.

Bangladesh: The BJP will pro-actively engage the Government of Bangladesh on issues
of mutual assistance and benefit. A friendly Government in Dhaka is in India’s interest.

Sri Lanka: The BJP believes that Sri Lanka has the right to deal with terrorism on its soil.
At the same time, the political, economic and human rights of Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority
community must be protected by the Government in Colombo. The BJP will pursue a robust
relationship with Sri Lanka and regain the initiative that has been lost during the last five years.

Afghanistan: The BJP believes that India has an important role in helping the people of
Afghanistan to rebuild their country and stabilise their society, as well as secure their lives from
the depredations of the Taliban operating from Pakistani sanctuaries. The BJP will further build
upon India-Afghanistan relations and work in close association with the international
community to ensure a stable, secure and prosperous Afghanistan.

Mother India’s Children Abroad

The BJP will maintain close contacts with people of Indian origin who have settled on
foreign shores. It has been the consistent policy of the BJP to promote the interests of people of
Indian origin living abroad. During the NDA years, special efforts were made to revive and
revitalise the ties between Pravasi Bharatiyas and their ancestral land by institutionalising the
Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, honouring achievers and introducing the PIO card. Those efforts will
be given a further boost.

DEFENDING INDIA
NO COMPROMISE, NO CONCESSION

he Indian Army, Air Force and Navy need to be strengthened in view of rapidly changing

regional and global realities. Tragically, the services have been ignored by the Congress and
failure to address the concerns of the Army, Air Force and Navy has bred undesirable discontent.
The BJP will address all pending issues immediately. It will be guided by the following solemn
commitments while dealing with the defence of India:

1. The long-pending acquisition of military hardware will be expedited through absolutely
transparent means in a time-bound manner.

2. Budget allocations for defence forces will be spent without being allowed to lapse. The
criminal negligence of the defence forces by the UPA Government has resulted in nearly
Rs 24,000 crore by way of budgetary allocations being allowed to lapse over five years.
This not only endangers the lives of our soldiers but also the security of the nation.

3. Our forces are performing a service to the nation and deserve better pay and privileges.
Towards this end, the BJP is committed to the following measures:

a. The pending issues of pay and privileges will be revisited and resolved to the
satisfaction of the defence forces. The modalities for setting up a separate Pay
Commission for the forces will be expedited;

b. All personnel of the Army, Air Force and Navy, as also paramilitary forces, will
be exempt from paying income tax on their salaries and perquisites;

c. The honorarium for winners of gallantry awards like Pram Vir Chakra, which is
abysmally low at Rs 500 to Rs 3,000, will be increased ten-fold to Rs 5,000 to Rs
30,000. This will be done with retrospective effect; the honorarium will be taxfree.

d. The principle of one rank, one pension will be implemented;

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

15

16

e. Incentive-based steps will be taken to make joining the defence services an exciting
proposition for young men and women to overcome the shortage of officers; and,

f. Incentives will be offered to State Governments for ensuring honourable settlement
of retired personnel of the defence services.

4. The present shortage of defence personnel at all levels will be met by making the Services
an attractive career option. This would include competitive pay and privileges, and
pension benefits. This task will be completed in a time-bound manner.

5. The capacities of Defence Research and Development Organisation will be enhanced.
The PPP route will be explored for conventional defence production bearing in mind the
nation’s needs and to make India a competitive player in the global market by 2020.

INDEPENDENT STRATEGIC NUCLEAR PROGRAMME
WE WILL ASSERT INDIA’S SOVEREIGNTY

he BJP believes that India’s strategic nuclear programme has been deeply compromised by

the Congress. The gains of Pokhran-II and subsequent development have been frittered
away for gains that have accrued to those who wish to see India’s nuclear programme to be
contained, rolled back and eventually dismantled.

The BJP will reverse this drift. India’s indigenous thorium technology programme will be
expedited and given all financial assistance, correcting the grievous wrong done by the UPA
Government. India needs nuclear energy, but not at the cost of our national strategic interests.
The Congress has fooled the people of India by selling the over-hyped India-US Civil Nuclear
Cooperation Agreement as an absolute necessity and how it will help light up people’s homes.
It has done so by suppressing two crucial facts. First, as the CAG has pointed out, the UPA
Government did not make the smallest effort to tap India’s own nuclear fuel supplies. Had it
done so, our reactors would have produced many times more power than at present. Second,
nuclear power is tremendously expensive and not affordable for the ‘aam admi’. The India-US
nuclear deal, in the final analysis, is not about empowering India but disempowering India by
making us dependent on American supplies and tying us to discriminatory regimes from which
Pakistan is free.

The BJP will honour India’s commitments to prevent proliferation. But it will pursue an
independent nuclear policy based on the following:

1. All options will be kept open and all steps will be taken that are necessary for the
technological advancement of India’s civil and military nuclear programmes.

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

2. Maintain a credible minimum deterrent that is in tune with changing realities.

3. Seek cross-party consensus before agreeing to any control regime, including CTBT,
FMCR and MTCR.

In view of the uncalled for and regrettable secrecy with which the Congress and the
Prime Minister dealt with the India-US nuclear deal, the BJP proposes to introduce an amendment
to the Constitution to make it mandatory for Government to seek Parliament’s approval/
ratification by two-thirds majority before signing any bilateral or multilateral agreement that
impinges on India’s strategic programmes, territorial integrity and economic interest.

FOOD SECURITY
WE WILL MAKE INDIA HUNGER-FREE

he BJP views food security as integral to national security. The spectre of a looming food
crisis haunts the developing world as never before. With the agriculture sector suffering on
account of the Congress’ gross negligence, India faces a real threat of food scarcity.

With India becoming a net importer of food under Congress rule, there is genuine concern
about food security. Three factors have contributed to increasing food scarcity and the resultant
sense of growing insecurity among the masses. First, the real income of workers and farmers
has not kept pace with the rising cost of food, thus reducing their purchasing power. Second,
the public distribution system has been severely crippled by the Congress-led Government which
has been more interested in importing food grains and selling them at a high price than in
securing the needs of the people. Third, with an additional 55 million people pushed below the
poverty line over the last five years, there is widespread malnourishment. The economic recession
has only worsened the situation and made it grimmer, especially for workers in the unorganised
sector.

The BJP believes people have the right to food. To ensure food security for all and eliminate
hunger, we will:

1. Provide 35 kg of rice or wheat every month to BPL families at Rs 2 per kg under an
improved and expanded Antyodaya Anna Yojana. This will be available against ‘Food
Coupons’ redeemable at both PDS and private outlets.

2. Allocate more funds for expanding, universalising and improving the functioning of the
Public Distribution System.

3. Preventing families from slipping below the poverty line.

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

4. Setting up community kitchens in extremely impoverished areas with the help of NGOs
through shared funding.

5. Aggressively addressing the problem of widespread malnutrition, especially by expanding
the scope of the existing mid-day meal scheme.

6. Encouraging the production of cereals and discouraging the conversion of fertile farm
land for dubious industrial projects.

7. Ensuring a sufficient level of food stocks are maintained to meet any exigencies due to
possible global food crisis which could be severely debilitating and make imports
prohibitively expensive, if not impossible.

ENERGY SECURITY
WE WILL PROTECT INDIA FROM FUTURE CRISES

TT cannot afford to lose any more time on securing its energy requirements. The Congress’s
response to this issue has been episodic at best, often resulting in India failing to secure its
energy interests even as other countries in the neighbourhood, most notably China, have spared
no effort to single-mindedly pursue the goal of securing their energy needs for the present and
future.

At present India is largely dependent on imported oil and gas to meet its energy demands,
especially demand for power although our per capita power consumption is only a sixth of the
world average. Sixty-seven per cent of our power supply comes from fossil fuels, of which 70
per cent is imported. With market fluctuation and manipulation, as it happened in 2008, this
makes us vulnerable to external factors.

The BJP proposes to invest heavily in developing non-fossil fuel-based clean energy sources,
especially for electricity production. Our goal will be to add at least 120,000 MW of power over
the next five years, with 20 per cent of it coming from renewable sources. Similar emphasis will
be placed on developing alternatives to petrol and diesel to lessen the burden of imported oil
and gas as well as meet the challenges of climate change.

Adequate support will be extended for developing hybrid technologies and their
applications. There will be special emphasis on developing renewal energy sources, especially
solar energy, wind energy and run-on-the-river technology, and bio-fuel. Innovation will be
rewarded.

Impetus will be provided for the production of non-conventional energy by enabling
people and firms to bank it in the power grid and draw it at the time of their need.

REVIVING THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
FROM RECESSION TO JOB-GENERATING GROWTH

he UPA Government's mismanagement of the national economy and fiscal indiscipline has

resulted in frittering away the tremendous gains of the NDA years. The slowing down of

India’s growth has had an adverse impact on people across the country. To control inflation,
the UPA Government drained liquidity out of the system, which, in turn, hobbled both the
organised and unorganised sectors. It is now desperately trying to reverse that flawed policy,

but clearly such half-hearted measures are not sufficient. The situation calls for determined,
direct and visible Government intervention. The BJP plans to do so through robust policies

aimed at revitalising the economy and placing India on the path of employment-generating

growth coupled with rapid development.

Towards this end, the BJP will take the following measures:

1.

Put in place a low tax, low interest regime so that people have more money and their
purchasing power increases, which in turn will serve as an impetus for the economy.

Exempt income up to Rs 3 lakh from Income Tax. Women and senior citizens will receive
an additional exemption benefit of Rs 50,000.

Income of all senior citizens by way of pension will be exempt from Income Tax.

To incentivise savings, all interest earned on bank deposits other than by corporates and
those who have business income shall be exempt from tax.

Dispense with clubbing of agricultural income with other sources of income for
determining tax liability on other income.

CST will be abolished and GST will be rationalised between 12 and 14 per; FBT will go.
ESOPS and MAT tax regime will be rationalised and made equitable.

Firm action will be initiated to minimise the presence of black money in the national
economy. We will take determined steps to bring back the money (estimated at Rs
25,00,000 crore and Rs 75,00,000 crore) illegally stashed in Swiss bank accounts and tax
havens, and use it for infrastructure development, housing, health and social welfare
schemes.

Arrest the loss of jobs and reverse the trend of joblessness which is far worse than
unemployment by making massive public sector investments in job-generating
infrastructure programmes, especially building of roads and highways, and linking of
rivers.

Hindustan Diamond Corporation will be provided full support to help the diamond
industry tide over the crisis caused by the global economic slump. It will provide raw
diamonds to the cutting and polishing units and bank them for future trade.

Highways construction, which got a boost during the NDA years, will once again feature
high on Government's agenda. We will build between 15 and 20 km of highways every
day.

The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, the largest rural connectivity programme
initiated by the NDA Government, will be fully implemented in the first three years.

Bring down interest rates for housing loans so that housing becomes affordable, accessible
and revives the stalled real estate sector which has witnessed huge job losses.

Enhance the capabilities of the manufacturing sector by easing credit availability.

Promote SMEs and the retail sector which can generate a large number of jobs and make
a meaningful contribution to the national economy. The criteria for classifying SMEs
will be reviewed.

Introduce reforms to improve productivity and greater capital formation.

Give a boost to tourism by selecting 50 tourist destinations and investing heavily in their
infrastructure and communications. Tourist arrivals will be doubled.

Impose countervailing restrictions on foreign companies operating in India, especially in
the services sector, which, on account of domestic laws of their respective countries,
have introduced restrictions on hiring Indian employees with valid work visas.

Regulatory bodies which are supposed to monitor the performance and balance sheets
of companies will be strengthened to prevent corporate fraud that dents India’s image
as well as has a direct impact on the market and investors.

Make India proud of Indian products, and make Indian brands globally competitive.

Ensure a decent level of consumption for all without encouraging consumerism.

URBAN INDIA
LOOKING AHEAD TO THE FUTURE

s the national economy grows and jobs are generated, there will be a matching increase in
the pressures on urban centres. Apart from assisting State Governments to renew and

revive existing cities and replace festering slums with hygienic, affordable living quarters, the
BJP will review and recast the Urban Development Policy. We will specifically do the following,

bearing in mind the challenges of the future:

1.

In pursuit of the principle of ‘Shelter for All’, 10 lakh dwelling units for the poor will be
constructed every year.

Fifteen new cities, with world class infrastructure facilities and amenities, will be built in
five years.

For existing urban centres, basic infrastructure facilities and amenities of water, drainage,
roads, electricity, environment and solid waste management will be enhanced for a clean
and healthy city life.

Peripheral areas of cities will be developed on the basis of ‘rurban’ concept to minimise
migration: The physical infrastructure facilities will be that of urban areas but the heart
and soul will be of rural areas.

GIS-based mapping of urban properties and title certification will be concluded.

Practical, pragmatic measures will be adopted to deal with emerging urban problems
like vehicular traffic overload.

AGRICULTURE
DEBT-FREE FARMER, PROSPEROUS INDIA

he pitiful state of our farm sector is best exemplified by debt-ridden farmers committing

suicide. The UPA Government, while actively promoting the import of food grains, has
callously ignored the plight of India’s farmers. There are three immediate concerns which will
be addressed by the BJP in a time-bound manner: Ensuring assured income for farmers; freeing
farmers from the burden of mounting debts; and, increasing public investment in agriculture.
Everything can wait, but not agriculture.

To make India’s farmer debt-free, the BJP will:
1. Waive agricultural loans.

2. Set up a commission to study the entire gamut of farmers’ loans and come up with an
actionable solution to the deepening crisis within six months.

3. Set a maximum ceiling of 4 per cent interest for agricultural loans to farmers from banks.
4. Introduce a pension scheme for aged and helpless farmers.

5. Make agriculture profitable by reducing the cost of inputs, enhancing yields and reviewing
the present method of determining prices.

6. Implement a Farm Income Insurance Scheme through which both price and produce
will be insured. In the event of loss of crops, farmers will be compensated under this
scheme so that they do not suffer any loss of income.

7. Promote nature-friendly cultivation and incentivise organic farming to arrest soil quality
depletion. Special marketing assistance for organic produce.

8. Introduce value addition schemes to reduce wastage and invest in food-processing units
which will generate jobs for rural youth.

9. Create irrigation facilities for an additional 35 million hectares of land in five years: This
will generate rural jobs as well as benefit farmers. Drip irrigation will be promoted along
with better water management and use of check dams.

10. Ensure quality power, seeds and other inputs.

11. Heavily invest funds in agriculture to reverse the trend set by the Congress-led UPA and
make the farm sector an equal engine of growth along with industry and the services
sector.

12. Strengthen National Rural Bank and allied services.

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

~S
13. Promote horticulture, floriculture, pisciculture and poultry for generating additional jobs
and supplementing incomes.

14. Create additional grazing land and encourage the maintenance of ponds and water
bodies.

GM Seeds

No genetically modified seed will be allowed for cultivation without full scientific data
on long-term effects on soil, production and biological impact on consumers. All food and food
products produced with genetically modified seeds will be branded as ‘GM Food’.

LAND ACQUISITION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE
FARMERS INTERESTS WILL BE PROTECTED

he Central and State Governments, for long, have acquired land, through an opaque process,

to hand it over to private parties under the umbrella of ‘public purpose’. The UPA
Government has approved 572 Special Economic Zones that cover 50,000 acres, three times the
size of Singapore. This is clearly absurd and spells disaster for the farm sector.

The BJP will adopt a National Land Use Policy which will protect the interests of farmers.
Its implementation will be monitored by a National Land Use Authority which will work with
State Land Use Authorities to regulate and facilitate land management. The powers and functions
of the National Land Use Authority will be similar to those of other regulatory bodies.

The BJP will bring about amendments to existing laws to rectify anomalies pertaining to
land acquisition. Farmers will be compensated at market rates for any land acquired for
infrastructure purposes. The BJP will not allow the conversion of fertile farmland for industrial/
commercial projects or Special Economic Zones.

The entire issue of Special Economic Zones and acquisition of land for industrial use will
be addressed after a careful scrutiny of the Parliamentary Standing Committee’s report and
factoring in the need to protect the farm sector and enhance food production.

International Trade Agreements

The BJP shall fight against the protectionist trend which is emerging in some developed
countries. We will safeguard the country’s interests in all bilateral and multilateral trade agree-
ments by avoiding to accept any new unilateral or less than reciprocal commitments. Our Gov-
ernment will renegotiate all such past commitments that are inconsistent with national inter-
ests, especially to ensure food security and affordable health care. We will not hesitate to roll
back any concessions and facilities not reciprocated by the counterparts. The BJP will safeguard
the interests of our vast technical manpower and ensure maximum market access in future
agreements depending upon the offers made by the trade partners.

Retail Trade

The BJP understands the critical importance of retail trade in the context of employment
and services provided by them, and thus favours a dominant role for the unincorporated sector
in retail trade. Towards this end, it will not allow foreign investment in the retail sector. After
agriculture, the retail sector is the largest employer of nearly four crore people.

We will:
1. Adopt all necessary measures to safeguard the interests of small and tiny retail vendors.

2. Ensure availability of working capital needs for such vendors through credit at not more
than four per cent interest.

3. Study the feasibility of a slab-based ‘Compound Tax’ for traders to free them from need-
less harassment and end corruption.

4. Set up an empowered committee to recommend welfare measures, including a pension
scheme, for small traders.

Labour

The BJP will holistically address the long-pending issue of labour reforms, bearing in
mind the long-term interests of the working class. It will do so through close consultation with
representative bodies of labour and employers. We are committed to ensure the following:

1. Making secret ballot compulsory for trade union elections, by suitably amending the
Industrial Disputes Act.

2. Launching a training programme for trade unions to play an effective and positive role.

3. Setting up a ‘Workers Bank’ to deal with the banking requirements of labour in the
organised and unorganised sectors.

4. Ensuring adequate compensation for any labour that may be retrenched, with the first
option being redeployment.

5. Setting up a National Child Labour Commission.

For labour in the unorganised sector, revise minimum wages; expand safety net.

Cooperative Sector

Every effort will be made to encourage the cooperative sector. Towards this end, the BJP

will do the following:

4.

Exempt cooperative banks from paying income tax.
Frame a model law for cooperative societies for nationwide implementation.
Amend the Multi-State Cooperative Act to remove current lacunae and anomalies.

CONSUMER RIGHTS

The rights of consumers will be further strengthened. The BJP will set up an experts

committee to deal with the following issues:

1.
2.

Setting up of services specific arbitration courts to settle consumer disputes.

Creating a mechanism for whereby consumers can participate in a structured consultative
process with Government.

Making consumer product labelling more content information specific.

YOUTH POWER
EMPOWERING YOUNG INDIA

ndia’s population, unlike that of Western nations, is getting younger by the day. More than
half of our citizens are aged 25 and below; nearly two-thirds are aged 35 and below. The
aspirations and ambitions of the youth are fuelled by rising literacy and awareness levels.

It is the Government's duty to help them achieve these aspirations and ambitions, and
make them capable of taking on all challenges and converting them into opportunities. The BJP
will fulfil this duty by framing policies in consonance with the concerns of ‘Young India’ and
aimed at unleashing the abilities of the youth, who will be the driving force of this nation’s
emergence as an awesome knowledge power. The BJP’s Manifesto has been drafted keeping the
aspirations and ambitions of the youth in mind.

We propose to review, revive and re-launch the National Service Scheme and National
Cadet Corps as effective vehicles to involve the youth in nation-building and reinforcing their
national spirit. Their participation in the decision-making process and decision-making bodies
will be actively encouraged.

The BJP also proposes to launch a unique ‘National Knowledge Incubation Programme’.
This will involve the setting up of ‘Incubation Centres’ for meritorious students from all strata of
society. To begin with, at least one per cent of the best brains will be deployed for mentoring at
the ‘Incubation Centres’. Adequate resources will be provided for the programme.

A National Student Bank will be set up to meet the banking requirements, including
study loans, of students, at 4% rate of interest.

EDUCATION FOR ALL
LITERATE INDIA, POWERFUL INDIA

he BJP will give education its due place in governance to achieve social, economic, cultural

and technical advancement. Education will be the Government’s instrument to reduce
poverty, promote health, protect the environment and advance gender equality. Central
allocation to education shall be raised to six per cent of the GDP. Our goal is to spend nine per
cent of GDP on education by involving the private sector.

A National Education Commission will be constituted to propose a comprehensive policy
for the 21* century. The content and process of education shall be made responsive to the needs
of the times and the aspirations of the young. The existing digital divide will be removed by
extending the outreach of information technology to every child.

Particular emphasis shall be laid on value education, inclusive education, education of
the migratory tribes and other deprived groups and all those who need additional support. The
examination system will be reviewed for extensive reform.

The following are the highlights of the BJP’s agenda to ensure education for all:

School Education
1. The success story of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, launched by the NDA in 2002, shall be
strengthened, extended and concretised further in quality, content and support systems.

2. Implementation of the mid-day meal scheme shall be revitalised on modern management
lines. Akshaya Patra Scheme will serve as a model for this purpose.

3. Effective steps shall be put in place to provide skills acquisition.

4. Primary school timings and vacations shall be flexible and decided upon by the local
community and the Parents-Teachers Associations.

5. Universalisation of secondary education shall be speedily implemented. Special emphasis
will be given to girls’ education at the secondary level.

6. All assistance will be provided for a national madarsa modernisation programme.

7. Close linkages between school education and higher education shall be built into the
system.

Vocational education
1. Widespread network of providing skill orientation and vocational training shall be
established. Provisions for certification of skills acquired traditionally or through private
initiatives shall be made.

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

2. Additional structures and facilities shall be created at secondary stage to provide generic
vocational skills to every child who is willing to do so.

3. A fresh countrywide initiative shall be launched to bring about an attitudinal
transformation among parents and communities towards skill development and
vocational education.

4. Industry shall be persuaded to play a greater role than at present to prepare skilled
manpower, which will be of mutual benefit.

Higher Education
1. Institutions of higher learning shall be given full autonomy, coupled with accountability,
in real practice.

2. Access to higher education shall be expanded without any compromise on quality and
content. Private initiatives shall be encouraged within the broad educational priority
parameters and provisions for focus groups.

3. Manpower planning shall be put in place and made active and effective. Higher education
prepares top-level manpower for every sector. Hence, its quality and relevance have a
multiplier effect.

New National Policy on Education

Immediate steps will be initiated to appoint a National Commission on Education, the
report of which shall lead to the formulation of a new National Policy on Education that will
replace the NPE-1986/92. This Commission shall undertake continuous envisioning of
educational plans, strategies methods, material and research to make India a knowledge power
and develop several institutions of higher learning and research as centres of international pursuit
of knowledge and learning.

Ragging to be Made a Criminal Offence with Stiff Punishment

The BJP will frame a law to deal with the menace of ragging. All cases of ragging will be
tried in fast-track courts. School/college/ university authorities will be held culpable for failing
to implement the law.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
OVER THE MOON AND BEYOND

he BJP in power will aggressively promote science and technology for the well-being of all

citizens and India’s progress as well as its emergence as force on the global scene. We
believe our science and technology system has to be infused with new vitality if it is to play a
decisive and beneficial role in advancing the well-being of all sections of our society.

Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee had promised Chandrayan - India’s mission to the Moon -
and it has been fulfilled by our scientists. We now propose to take the mission a step forward:
Chandrayan - II will see Indians stepping on the Moon in the next five years.

We will take India into the ‘Super Computer’ era to enhance the nation’s defence
capabilities and scientific research and development.

The BJP recognises the central role of science and technology in raising the quality of life
of the people of the country, particularly of the disadvantaged sections of society, in creating
wealth for all, in making India globally competitive, in utilising natural resources in a sustainable
manner, in protecting the environment and ensuring national security. Our objectives will be
aimed at:

1. Ensuring food, agricultural, nutritional, environmental, water, health and energy
security of the people on a sustainable basis.

2. Mounting a direct and sustained effort on the alleviation of poverty, enhancing
livelihood security, removal of hunger and malnutrition, reduction of drudgery and
regional imbalances, both rural and urban, and generation of employment, by using
scientific and technological capabilities along with our traditional knowledge pool.

3. Building and maintaining centres of excellence, which will raise the level of work in
selected areas to the highest international standards along with creating suitable
employment opportunities.

4. Promoting the empowerment of women in all science and technology activities and
ensuring their full and equal participation.

5. Providing necessary autonomy and freedom of functioning for all academic and
R&D institutions, while ensuring that science and technology enterprises are fully
committed to their social responsibilities and commitments.

6. Accomplishing national strategic and security-related objectives by using the latest
advances in science and technology.

Encouraging research and innovation in areas of relevance for the economy and
society, particularly by promoting close and productive interaction between private
and public institutions. Sectors such as agriculture (particularly soil and water
management, human and animal nutrition, fisheries), water, health, education,
industry, energy including renewable energy, communication and transportation
would be accorded highest priority. Key leverage technologies such as information
technology, biotechnology and materials science and technology would be given
special importance.

Establishing an Intellectual Property Rights regime which maximises the incentives
for the generation and protection of intellectual property by all types of inventors.

Ensuring, in an era in which information is key to the development of science and
technology, that all efforts are made to have high-speed access to information, both
in quality and quantity, at affordable costs; and also create digitised, valid and usable
content of Indian origin.

Encouraging research and application to meet the challenges of climate change and
for forecasting, prevention and mitigation of natural hazards, particularly, floods,
cyclones, earthquakes, drought and landslides.

Promoting international science and technology cooperation towards achieving the
goals of national development and security, and make it a key element of our
international relations.

The BJP will also focus on the following:

1.

New funding mechanism for promotion of basic research in science, medical,
agricultural and engineering institutions.

Promotion of innovation by creating a comprehensive national system of innovation.

Achieving synergy between industry and scientific research. Autonomous technology
transfer organisations will be created as associate organisations of universities and
national laboratories to transfer the know-how generated by them to industry.
Industry will be encouraged to adopt or support educational and research institutions
to help direct science and technology endeavours towards tangible industrial goals.

Indigenous knowledge, based on our long and rich tradition will be further developed
and harnessed for the purpose of wealth and employment generation.

Intellectual Property Rights have to be viewed not as a self-contained and distinct
domain, but rather as an effective policy instrument relevant to wide-ranging socio-
economic, technological and political concepts. The generation and fullest protection

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

of competitive intellectual property from Indian R&D programmes will be encouraged
and promoted.

Science and technology, we believe, should be used to build a new and resurgent India
that continues to maintain its strong democratic and spiritual traditions, that remains secure
not only militarily but also socially and economically. Our science and technology policy will
be framed and implemented so as to be in harmony with our worldview of the larger human
family. We will ensure that science and technology truly uplifts the Indian people and indeed
all of humanity.

PROMOTION OF SPORTS
MAKING YOUTH HEALTHY, COMPETITIVE

r o make the nation a strong player in diverse international sports, the BJP will invest in every
sporting activity. This is an essential element of achieving our goal of making India a devel-
oped nation in the sports world within five years. Towards this end, we will:

1. Introduce sports as a compulsory part of school curriculum. Towards this end, sports
infrastructure and facilities in schools, colleges and universities will be expanded with
adequate provision of resources by the Ministry of Human Resource Development and
State Governments. Rs 5,000 crore will be allocated for the purpose to be released through
the UGC, Central Educational Boards / Sangathans and State Governments for speedy
implementation of sports and youth development activities.

2. Create an effective National Sports Talent Search System so that extraordinary sporting
talent is identified at a very young age. Such promising boys and girls will be selected for
special training. The existing rural sports programme and National Women Sports
Festival will be broadened to reach every village and to identify talent for nurturing and
excellence development.

3. Ensure sports training is world class by appointing excellent coaches, training of sports
persons abroad and upgrading the skills of existing coaches. International training and
competition exposure programme will be prepared for which an amount of Rs 1,000
crore will be allocated per year.

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

Offer a secure and attractive career plan both in public and private sector for medal
winners in National Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Olympic
Games. The present reservation of jobs only in Groups C and D categories under Central
Government Rule will be suitably revised to provide employment to meritorious
sportspersons in Groups A and B categories also. Similarly, all public sector undertakings
will be advised to employ international medal winners in Groups A and B categories.

Encourage business houses to set aside some resources for the development of sports.
They will be offered tax incentives for creating sports infrastructure and sponsoring
sports events at district, State, national and international level.

Make the management of various agencies involved in sports promotion more efficient
and accountable. All these institutions will be made to recognise that our sportspersons
are the most important entity in our strategy to achieve excellence in sports. Hence,
transparency will be ensured in their functioning.

Amend guidelines for the MPLAD scheme so that MPs can make their funds available
for promotion of sports and adventure activities.

Mandate all new housing colonies to include sports facilities.

Enhance Plan allocation for sports development and encourage State Governments to
fully discharge their responsibility in the promotion of sports.

WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT
NARI SHAKTI KEY TO INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT

he BJP’s political adversaries talk of women’s empowerment but have done nothing to truly

empower them. The Congress had promised to introduce the law for women’s reservation
in State Assemblies and Parliament. But it had neither the conviction to introduce the legislation
nor the courage to stand up to its allies who are opposed to the political empowerment of
women. The BJP remains committed to 33 per cent political representation for women, and
shall act on this after coming to power.

There are other key areas where the BJP will focus its attention to empower women:

1. Introduce the Ladli Lakshmi Scheme, which has been a big success in Madhya Pradesh,
at the national level to encourage girls to attend school up to at least pre-college level.
Under this scheme, each girl child from disadvantaged families will receive Rs 2,000 on
reaching Class 6; Rs 4,000 in Class 9; Rs 7,500 in Class 11; and, Rs 1,10,000 on completing
21 years of age. From Class 6 onwards, she will get a stipend of Rs 2,400 per year till
such time she remains in school.

2. Adopt the Bhamashah Vitteeya Sashaktikaran Evam Naari Samriddhi Yojana, conceived
by the erstwhile BJP Government in Rajasthan, to financially empower women from
Below Poverty Line, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes families and those of small
and marginal farmers. Under this scheme, bank accounts will be opened for the
beneficiary women and they alone will be able to operate the accounts through specially
designed smart cards. An initial deposit of Rs 1,500 will be made in the bank accounts.
The scheme also envisages job creation through opening of banks in remote areas and
counsellors to help the beneficiaries to manage their accounts.

3. A national programme will be launched, in cooperation with State Governments, to
provide bicycles to girls from Below Poverty Line Families who attend school.

4. Review and revamp women’s participation in local self-governance, especially panchayati
raj bodies.

5. Adopt a National Policy on Women’s Economic Empowerment to ensure every woman
has access to livelihood and enhance the income of all categories of working women.
Gender discrimination in wages, whether in organised or unorganised sector, will be
eliminated.

6. Remove all remaining gender disparities in property rights, marital rights and
cohabitation rights.

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

7. Support for programmes like ‘Swavalamban’ and ‘STEP’ (Support to Training and
Employment Programme), which promote self-employment and entrepreneurship for
women through self-help groups, will be greatly enhanced. Technical and management
services for those engaged in handicrafts, food-processing, handloom, garments, etc,
will be strengthened. Added focus will be provided for implementing these programmes
in the North-East, Jammu & Kashmir, and areas affected by Maoism.

8. Enterprises promoted by women, or employing a large number of women, will be given
‘fast track’ facilitation. They will get loans at preferential rates of interest.

9. Laws to check female foeticide, dowry, child marriage, trafficking, rape and family
violence will be reviewed, strengthened and strictly enforced. The CrPC will be amended
to ensure the rights of victims of rape are not diminished and the guilty are not able to
tamper with evidence or escape the law of the land. A special programme will be launched,
in cooperation with State Governments, to ensure full security for women.

10. Programmes aimed at helping indigent women and women in distress will be
strengthened with the cooperation of State Governments.

11. Every effort will be made to expand and improve upon the existing network of working
women’s hostels.

12. The current extremely low salaries of Anganwadi workers and helpers, who are the
backbone of the Integrated Child Development Scheme, will be doubled.

Protecting Women’s Rights

Article 44 of the Constitution of India lists Uniform Civil Code as one of the Directive
Principles of State Policy. There cannot be real gender equality till such time India adopts a
Uniform Civil Code which protects the rights of all women. The BJP, as a first step towards this
constitutionally mandated direction, will set up a Commission to draft a Uniform Civil Code,
drawing upon the best traditions and harmonising them with the modern times. The Commission
will also study reforms towards gender equality in other countries, including Islamic countries.

DALITS, OBCs & ECONOMICALLY WEAKER SECTIONS OF SOCIETY
WE WILL ENSURE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND HARMONY

he BJP is committed to the principle of Social Justice (Samajik Nyay) and Samajik Samarasata

(Social Harmony). Instead of pursuing identity politics which do not fetch benefits to Dalits,
OBCs and other deprived sections of our society, the BJP will focus on tangible development
and empowerment.

The BJP will boost opportunities for entrepreneurship and commerce among Dalits, OBCs
and other deprived sections of our society so that India’s social diversity is fairly reflected in its
economic diversity.

Atrocities against Dalits, Tribals and weaker sections of society will be firmly dealt with.

The extremely backward communities need urgent Government assistance. Special efforts
will be made to reach out to them. In contrast to the UPA years when an additional 55 million
people were pushed below the poverty line, the BJP will strive to bring families above the poverty
line through aggressive policies and targeted programmes.

A mission-mode approach will be adopted for providing the following to deprived communities:
1. Special educational facilities through Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan.
2. Water, health, sanitation and hygiene for all families/habitations.

A special component will be created in all development schemes to benefit the deprived
sections of society. An ‘Extremely Backward Communities Development Bank’ will be set up for
promoting skill enhancement through learn-and-earn schemes for their uplift.

The BJP will introduce education and job quotas on the basis of economic criteria for all
economically weaker sections of society other than Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and
OBCs, who will continue to enjoy quota benefits.

TRIBAL DEVELOPMENT
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR LASTING WELFARE

t is a proven fact that incremental and piecemeal attempts for the development of tribals

have not helped. Hence, the BJP will adopt a comprehensive, all-encompassing long-term

strategy to empower tribals and ensure their welfare. We will draw upon the experience of our
Governments in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh which have successfully

implemented tribal welfare and development schemes.

We will initiate a ‘Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana’ at the national level, to be overseen by a

‘Tribal Development Authority’. This scheme will focus on:

1.

Setting up new schools and colleges, as also engineering colleges, polytechnics, agri-
engineering colleges, nursing schools, veterinary schools.

Upgrading housing, water and health facilities.
Electrification of tribal hamlets and provision of all-weather roads.

Initiating new economic activities related to agriculture and agri-processing,
horticulture, etc.

Promoting dairy-based activities.

Creating employment opportunities by promoting bamboo-processing units and small-
scale units.

Preventing tribal land from being alienated.
Facilitating access to minor forest produce and creating a network of rural markets.

Establishing a National Research Centre for the preservation of tribal culture and
languages.

10. Providing adequate funds for tribal welfare and development.

SENIOR CITIZENS
CARE AND RESPECT FOR THE ELDERLY

he elderly deserve full support of both Government and society. The BJP is committed to the
welfare of senior citizens. A separate department will be created in the Social Welfare
Ministry to deal with senior citizens’ issues. We will:

1. Review pensions and pension policies to ensure benefits keep pace with the actual cost
of living.

2. Study the feasibility of introducing higher interest rates on savings for all citizens above
60 years of age.

3. Rationalise travel concessions.
4. Introduce a health insurance policy that does not discriminate against the elderly.

5. Income tax benefits for senior citizens will be made available at 60 years, instead of 65
years as is the practice at present.

6. Review existing provisions of old age pension scheme and expand its application.

CARE OF THE DISABLED
INTEGRATING THE DIFFERENTLY ABLED

De people constitute five per cent of India’s population. Years of neglect has delayed
their integration into the social mainstream. Their welfare and rehabilitation is integral to
NDA’s vision of a caring society and a responsive government. The BJP will:

1. Ensure and implement the right for education and vocational training for the disabled.
2. Ensure disabled-friendly access to public utilities, public buildings, and transport.

3. Ensure maximum economic independence of the disabled by creating more income
generation models for the disabled.

4. Facilitate establishment of an Institute of Vocational Training for the Disabled in every
district with public-private partnership.

5. Provide special incentive for the adoption of a disabled child.

6. Support voluntary organizations working for the care of the disabled.

MINORITY COMMUNITIES
HEALTHY DIET OF DEVELOPMENT

he BJP repudiates the division of Indian society along communal lines which has been

fostered by the Congress and the Left in pursuit of their vote-bank politics. Categorisation
of communities as ‘minorities’ perpetuates notions of imagined discrimination and victimhood;
it reinforces the perception of the ‘minority’ identity as separate from the national identity. The
BJP remains committed to a common Indian identity that transcends community, caste and
gender, with every Indian an equal participant in the building of a prosperous nation and an
equal beneficiary of that prosperity. Pluralism is a sine qua non for any democracy and the BJP
cherishes the diversity that is also the strength of Indian society and lends vibrancy to our
national fabric. But pluralism should strengthen, not weaken our national resolve.

It is an unfortunate fact that Muslims form a substantial part of the underprivileged. The
principal reason for this is the fact that the Congress, a dominant presence in power for six
decades, has secured minority support through the politics of fear rather than a healthy diet of
development.

The BJP will implement a set of policies committed to a massive expansion of modern
education among Muslims, particularly for the girl child, through a new nationwide network of
schools, in a public-private partnership programme. This will include, but not be limited to:

1. Capital assistance in new educational projects, both for basic and technical education,
in low-income minority areas. Each project will be vetted for viability by a team of
professionals within a maximum of six months.

2. Cash incentives for the education of the girl child, based on attendance and
performance. Incentives will rise for those girls who get admission into recognised
colleges for higher education.

3. Computer centres will be set up in low income urban areas and the most backward
districts of the country.

4. The Ministry of Minority Affairs, today a stagnant source of toxic politics, will be
revitalised into a hub for economic projects specifically targeted towards employment
creation. There will be special emphasis on crafts and small-scale industries that
have been traditional employers of minorities. The neglect of the Congress-led UPA
Government was evident in the fact that even monies allotted for minority welfare
programmes in States like Maharashtra were largely, if not wholly, unspent.

5. Youth are the owners of the future, and it is our duty to make them a dynamic social
and economic engine for upliftment. The young do not live only in cities. In districts

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

39

—O =

like Murshidabad in Bengal, young girls are being forced by poverty into making
bidis on pathetic wages. Dynamic intervention is needed to improve income levels
where such jobs exist and to create fresh avenues of employment where they do not.
The unfortunate phase of confused loyalties in some minority sections is over.
Generations have been born in free India who are as committed to the nation as the
nation is committed to them. The success stories of Muslims in sports, cinema, industry
and a host of other fields, as individuals and team players, makes every Indian proud.

6. Terrorism does not havea religion. Those who espouse terrorism have stepped outside
the moral code of their religion into barbarism. We must lift community-relations
from the morass of misunderstanding.

A vibrant, modern India can have no place for either the perpetrators or the exploiters of fear.

Religious Conversions

The BJP will facilitate, under the auspices of noted religious leaders, the setting up of a
permanent inter-faith consultative mechanism to promote harmony among and trust between
communities. This mechanism will also be used for a sustained and sincere Inter-Faith Dialogue
between leaders of the Hindu and Christian communities on all aspects of life, including the
issue of religious conversions. The dialogue should be held in the spirit of the unanimous report
of the Inter-Faith Dialogue on Conversions, which was organised at the Vatican in May 2006 by
the Pontifical Council for Inter-Faith Dialogue and the World Council of Churches, Geneva.

HEALTH FOR ALL
INDIA’S WEALTH, PEOPLE’S HEALTH

AS to quality and affordable healthcare remains a dream for a vast majority of our
people. This is truly ironical because India is rapidly emerging as a global destination for
medical care for foreigners.

The BJP will launch a massive programme, through public-private participation, to
introduce a ‘Health for All’ scheme based on an innovative insurance policy. Under this scheme,
the premium of BPL families will be paid by Government. Beneficiaries will have access to
Government and private hospitals for cashless treatment.

We will make the ‘108’ telephone service - for medical emergencies - universally accessible
throughout India in 12 months.

One of our main targets will be to eradicate the curse of malnutrition. We will do so by
revamping existing programmes and launching a multi-pronged war against malnutrition across
the nation, especially in the under-developed areas, with the help of State Governments. All
resources will be provided to achieve this goal.

The BJP will also initiate action on the following:

1. Set up a National Regulatory Authority for private hospitals, nursing homes and special
care facilities to ensure quality services, affordable fees and prevent/ punish malpractice.
While private sector participation in health care is welcome, it cannot become a source
of unrestricted and unrestrained profit-making at the expense of the people.

2. Ongoing work on setting up six additional All-India Institutes of Medical Sciences in
various parts of the country, which were proposed by the NDA Government but not
acted upon by the UPA, will be expedited. Similar institutions will be set up in other
places to broad-base access to specialised medical care.

3. Incentives and disincentives will be introduced for State Governments to improve the
quality of primary health care, maternal health care, and child health care.

4. Targets will be set for achieving significant reduction in maternal and infant mortality
by improving the Janani Suraksha Yojana. The successful initiative of the BJP Government
in Gujarat in this regard will be used as a model.

5. Preventive health care by way of inoculation against diseases and dissemination of
information will receive focussed attention.

6. A national programme will be launched to vaccinate adults and children against all
forms of hepatitis.

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

7. Substantial investment will be made in promoting Ayurved as an alternative therapy.
Full support will be extended to the promotion of Unani system of medicine and
homoeopathy. The promotion of Yoga will receive all Government assistance.

8. Clean drinking water is one of the best barriers against common but often fatal diseases.
The BJP proposes to make access to clean drinking water a fundamental right for all
citizens.

Population Stabilisation

The BJP views the people of India as productive assets of society. To maximise their
productivity, they have to be provided with access to health, education, technology and skills,
which, in turn, require additional resources. This will be possible if we are able to stabilise
India’s population. Towards this end, the BJP will address three priority issues:

1. Recognition of close linkages between sustainable development and population
stabilisation.

2. Link population programmes with other development initiatives like health, education,
nutrition and poverty eradication programmes.

3. Follow a non-coercive and gender sensitive approach for population stabilisation.

ONE EARTH, GREEN EARTH
CREATING THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT

he BJP will pursue national growth objectives through an ecologically sustainable pathway

that leads to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. We recognise that containing global
warming is essential to protecting life and security of people and environment. Mitigating the
threat by building a low carbon economy is the biggest economic opportunity of the 21""
century.

The BJP endorses the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”, as
enshrined in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. We look at ‘Climate Change’
in the context of the promises made by the international community for technology transfer and
additional financing since Rio, which have remained unfulfilled. The BJP will actively pursue
the transfer of critical technologies that can have a significant impact on reducing carbon

emissions.
Bearing in mind concerns on environment and related climate change issues, the BJP will:

1. Give appropriate importance to containing climate change.

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

11.

Lay importance on energy security and sustainable energy pathways by setting clear
targets for energy efficiency and renewable energy.

Bring about a complete shift in subsidy from chemical fertilisers to rewarding farmers
for pursuing conservation and enhancement of local crop varieties, thereby enhancing
the conservation of local agro-biodiversity.

Offer attractive support prices and incentives for traditional rain-fed crops and promote
markets for them. This will be coupled with a decentralised Public Distribution System
that will mop up excess production of local food and distribute it among those households
that are food deficit locally. A decentralised PDS will be more climate smart since it will
eliminate excessive costs of transportation and storage.

Revisit laws for protecting forests and reserve parks to make them more effective in
preventing encroachment and man-animal conflict. All resources will be provided for
protecting forestland and animal reserves; wilful destruction of forests and killing of
wildlife for profit or pleasure will fetch stringent punishment.

A permanent Task Force will be set up for the protection and preservation of tigers, lions
and other wild cats. A separate Task Force will look after the protection and preservation
of elephants. A third Task Force will look after bird sanctuaries. They will be duly
empowered to take whatever steps are necessary to achieve their goals.

Provide incentives to encourage institutions and individuals to switch over to energy-
saving devices and eco-friendly designs for housing and workplace. Full support will be
given for developing low-energy, low-cost technology by both public and private sectors.
A Group of Experts will be set up to formulate target-driven objectives towards this end.

Encourage citizens’ participation in protecting the environment and curbing pollution.
Schools will be involved in promoting environment and ecology-related issues among
children.

Adopt a mission-mode approach to clean all rivers.

Launch a national programme for citizens’ participation in reforestation, agro-forestry
and social forestry by planting a billion trees every year.

Importance given to programmes to arrest the melting of Himalayan glaciers from which
most major rivers in North India originate.

ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES & CENTRE-STATE RELATIONS
WE ARE COMMITTED TO GOOD GOVERNANCE

he BJP will set up a Group of Ministers to study the report of the Administrative Reforms

Commission and submit its recommendations within six months. Given the importance of
these reforms to our pursuit of the goal of Good Governance, the BJP proposes to implement
them through an appropriate body under the Prime Minister’s Office. We will strive to bring
about absolute transparency in Government's decision-making process. Corruption at any level
of Government will be dealt with swiftly.

We will place Centre-State relations on an even keel through the process of consultation.
The genuine grievances of States will be addressed in a comprehensive manner. The moribund
National Development Council will be revived and made into an active body.

While every effort will be made to meet the development aspirations of the people and
make authority accountable to the citizens, no concessions will be made to separatist and insurgent
groups.

Jammu & Kashmir

Jammu & Kashmir was, is and shall remain an integral part of the Union of India. Its
status is non-negotiable and, as successive elections have comprehensively demonstrated, the
people of Jammu & Kashmir see themselves as part of the Indian national mainstream.

The BJP will be guided by the following principles while dealing with issues related to
Jammu & Kashmir:

1. The territorial integrity of India is inviolable. The unanimous Parliamentary Resolution
of 1994 reiterates this point and shall remain the cornerstone of future decisions and
actions of our Government.

2. To meet the aspirations of the people of Jammu & Kashmir and ensure rapid progress
of this State, the BJP will promote an agenda of equal development of its three regions
— Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. All support, including financial, will be provided to
the State Government for this purpose.

3. The Pandits who had to leave their home and hearth in the Kashmir Valley on account
of separatist violence and terrorism are fully deserving of all support and assistance,
which will be provided to them in full measure. Their return to the land of their ancestors
with full dignity, security and assured livelihood will figure high on the BJP’s agenda.

4. The long-pending problems and demands of refugees from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
will be addressed.

 

BJP MANIFESTO - LOK SABHA ELECTION 2009

5. Article 370 poses a psychological barrier for the full integration of the people of Jammu
& Kashmir with the national mainstream. The BJP remains committed to the abrogation
of this Article.

Small States

The BJP has always been in favour of formation of smaller states. It was during the
NDA’s rule that the three small states of Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh were cre-
ated. Keeping in mind its commitment to good governance and all-round development, the BJP
in future, too, would encourage the cause of establishment of smaller States.

In consonance with its policy, the BJP supports the creation of Telangana as a separate
State of the Union of India.

We will sympathetically examine and appropriately consider the long pending demands
of the Gorkhas, the Adivasis and other people of Darjeeling district and Dooars region.

North-East

Poor governance, corruption and insurgency have resulted in the resources-rich north-
eastern States lagging behind. The physical distance between the North-East and New Delhi
has contributed to the widening of psychological distance. The NDA years saw the Union
Government actively pushing a development agenda for the north-eastern States. A similar but
more robust agenda will be crafted by the BJP in power for the welfare of every north-eastern
State and the region’s rapid development. In doing so, the BJP will be guided by the following:

1. Immediate steps will be taken to stem the tide of illegal immigration from Bangladesh to
Assam and other North-Eastern States. The construction of the India-Bangladesh border
fence will be completed without any further delay. A special cell will be set up to monitor
the detection, detention and deportation of illegal immigrants.

2. Insurgent groups will be dealt with firmly. Simultaneously, the grievances of a section of
the youth will be identified and addressed.

3. The land and culture of indigenous ethnic groups will be protected.
4. Flood control in Assam and river water management will receive special attention.

5. Appropriate resources will be allocated for land development, agriculture and allied
activities, housing, nutrition, health, education, rural connectivity and irrigation.

6. New institutions of higher education in engineering and medical sciences will be set up.

7. Job-generating schemes will be initiated, especially in the services sector, to address the
problem of unemployment in the region. Tourism and traditional skills-based industries
will be given a big boost.

8. Special emphasis will be given to connectivity with and within North-Eastern States.

Hill States & Desert States

The BJP recognises the special needs and unique problems of the hill and desert States.
In consultation with the Governments of these States, a development-based, State-specific
model will be evolved so that the aspirations of the people can be met.

Union Territories

Given their unique status, Union Territories will receive special attention. We will focus
on developing and strengthening the economy of Union Territories. Tourism will be promoted;
tribal welfare and rights will receive full attention; and, infrastructure and coastal area
development will be given top priority.

Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshdweep Islands
The BJP is committed to the protection and integrated development of our island
territories.

Judicial Reforms

The BJP will initiate a set of judicial reforms to deal with the issue of appointment of
judges, tackling the backlog of cases and other problems that exist at various levels of the
judiciary.

Towards this end, the BJP will:

1. Streamline the appointment procedure of judges in the higher judiciary through the
National Judicial Commission and introduce guidelines on objective criteria to determine
merit.

2. Double the number of courts and the judicial strength of the sub-ordinate judiciary in
five years.

3. Create a Fund for Modernisation of Courts to improve the physical and operational
infrastructure of courts.

4. Set up a separate class of courts for cases involving specified commercial laws such as
the Contract Act, Negotiable Instruments Act, and other business laws. These would
deliver quicker justice and be partly funded by charging both litigants a ‘Fast Track’
fee.

5. Reform the criminal justice system to make dispensation of justice simpler, quicker and
more effective on the basis of the Malimath Committee Report.

6. Computerise and network courts all over the country for improving their efficiency.
7. Extend fast track courts to all layers of the judiciary.

8. Expand alternative disputes redressal mechanisms through Lok Adalats and Tribunals.

9. Appoint a Judicial Procedural Reforms Committee which will suggest, in six months,
how to halve the time taken to conduct every trial, civil or criminal. The aim would be to
ensure that three-fourths of all cases are completed within 12 months.

10. Halve the number of cases in which the Government is a litigant in the next three years.

Electoral Reforms

The BJP will seek, through consultation with other parties, to evolve a method of holding
Assembly and Lok Sabha elections simultaneously. Apart from reducing election expenses for
both political parties and Government, this will ensure a certain stability for State Governments.

Panchayati Raj Institutions
To empower self-governance at the grassroots level, the BJP will strengthen Panchayati
Raj institutions. Towards this end, it will:

1. Work for the effective financial and administrative empowerment of Panchayati Raj
institutions and Urban Local Bodies in respect of funds, functions and functionaries.
There will be further devolution of powers by amending the Constitution.

2. The institution of the Gram Sabha will be strengthened to enable a full discussion on
development projects, scrutinise the allocation and spending of funds, and evaluating
the performance of elected and Government functionaries.

PRESERVING OUR CULTURAL HERITAGE

Ram Setu
Ram Setu is our national heritage. Millions want to visit it and it can be developed as a
centre of cultural tourism. For millions it is a place of pilgrimage.

Saving Rama Setu is to save the vast thorium deposits which are the future source of our
energy. Thorium technology will ensure India’s energy security. BJP will, therefore, look for an
alternative alignment for the proposed Sethu-Samudram Channel Project (SSCP).

Ram Temple

There is an overwhelming desire of the people in India and abroad to have a grand
temple at the birth place of Sri Ram in Ayodhya. The BJP will explore all possibilities, including
negotiations and judicial proceedings, to facilitate the construction of the Ram Temple in
Ayodhya.

Ganga

Ganga occupies a special place in the Indian psyche. It is most unfortunate that it has
been thoroughly neglected even after India attained freedom. It is a pity that even after six
decades of independence Ganga continues to be thoroughly polluted and is drying. The BJP will
ensure the cleanliness, purity and uninterrupted flow of Ganga, and will take all measures,
legal and administrative, in this regard. Necessary financial and technical assistance will be
provided on priority.

In addition, a massive ‘Clean Rivers Programme’ will be launched across the country
with the participation of voluntary organisations.

Cow and its Progeny

In view of the recent judgement by the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, and
in keeping with the Directive Principles of State Policy as contained in the Constitution, necessary
legal framework will be created to protect and promote cow and its progeny.

In view of the contribution of cow and its progeny to agriculture, socio-economic and
cultural life of our country, the Department of Animal Husbandry will be suitably strengthened
and empowered for the protection and promotion of cow and its progeny. A National Cattle
Development Board will be set up to implement a programme for the improvement of indigenous
livestock breeds.

Monasteries and Temples

The BJP shall ensure autonomous administration of Maths and Mandirs.

These institutions have been the heart and hub of dharmic and cultural life and traditions
of Indian society. Huge properties were offered to Maths and Mandirs by society for running
their religio-cultural activities and service projects for the benefit of all. The management of
such institutions should be freed from Government control and handed over to autonomous
bodies constituted by the followers and devotees of those seats. Necessary legal framework will
be provided for this purpose.

All dharmic activities will be considered as ‘charity’ with appropriate tax incentives. A
special cell will be created to make dharmic organisations’ interface with government agencies
hassle-free.

A National Mission for beautifying and improving the infrastructure and amenities at
pilgrimage centres of all faiths will be launched.

Waaqf Properties

The BJP will examine the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee
regarding Waqf properties headed by Shri K Rahman Khan, Deputy Chairman, Rajya Sabha,
and would, in consultation with Muslim religious leaders, take steps to remove encroachments
from and unauthorised occupation of wagf properties.

Heritage Sites
The ASI will be provided with appropriate resources for the maintenance of all national
heritage sites and prevent their vandalisation in any form.

Languages

Indian languages are repositories of our rich literature, history, culture, art and scientific
achievements. Many of our dialects are important source for knowing our heritage. Samskrit
and Tamil have made remarkable contributions in this regard. B.J.P. would promote Indian
languages and measures for the development of all Indian languages including Urdu will be
taken by providing adequate resources so that they become a powerful vehicle for creating a
knowledge society.

8th April, 2019

Dear sisters and brothers,

The BJP comes to you to seek your valued blessings yet again, so that India continues unhindered on the
path of development, to realize its true destiny with renewed vigour.

Five years ago, on 26th May 2014, we commenced our journey to transform our great nation and do justice
to the historic mandate bestowed upon us.

At that time, India's challenges were monumental- our economy was in the doldrums, the nation was
among the fragile five, pessimism and despair was all-pervasive and corruption was rampant. There were
serious doubts in the minds of many about India's ability to fulfill the dreams and aspirations of her citizens.

But, if challenges were enormous, so was our resolve to build a stronger, safer and prosperous nation.
Powered and inspired by the strengths and skills of 130 crore Indians, we converted obstacles into
opportunities, decay into development and pessimism into positivity.

At an unimaginable speed and scale, what seemed impossible earlier soon became a reality. In the last five
five years, every Indian family got a bank account due to Jan Dhan Yojana, 50 crore Indians got health
insurance thanks to Ayushman Bharat and more than 40 crore people in the unorganised sector can now
avail pension coverage. A subject like cleanliness ignited the imagination of the nation and now we are close
to 99% sanitation coverage, compared toa mere 38% in 2014. It is now possible for youngsters from smaller
towns to become entrepreneurs thanks to Mudra Yojana. The rising neo-middle and middle class with
taxable income upto Rs. 5 lakhs nolonger need to pay income tax.

Our Government filled the infrastructure gaps with speed and foresight. The pace of construction of roads
and railway lines has doubled. India has now more efficient ports. 18,000 villages living in darkness till 2014
are now brightly lit thanks to rural electrification efforts. More than 2.6 crore homes have been electrified
through Saubhagya Yojana. Over 1.5 crore homes built over the last five years have enabled millions to
dream big.

The nation is no longer helpless against the barbaric forces of terror. Any destructive ideology that destroys
the atmosphere of peace and unity is and will be given a befitting reply. They are being paid back in their own
coin, with compoundinterest.

India's Northeast, which earlier made headlines for blockage and neglect, is now witnessing
unprecedented development. The Northeast is now closer to the national mainstream in more ways than
one.

 

 

The Central Government has waged a determined crusade against the scourge of corruption and black
money. The culture of middlemen roaming in the corridors of power is now history. Decisions are guided by
public interest of all Indians and not the self-interest of a select few. The trinity of Jan Dhan- Aadhaar and
Mobile has weeded out over 8 crore fake beneficiaries, and prevented leakages of more than Rs. 1 lakh
crore. Systems have been strengthened to prevent money laundering. The corrupt have begun to realize
that their machinations will no longer be tolerated.

One can clearly see how development has become amass movement. Numerous people friendly decisions
have led to the empowerment of 130 crore Indians and the safeguarding of our strategic interests.

Today, India stands tall at the international level. The world recognizes India's immense potential, which is
clearly reflected in a record rise in foreign investment. India's stand on subjects like terrorism, climate
change and prevention of money laundering are setting the global narrative.

Friends,

Through this Sankalp Patra, you would get a glimpse of the challenges of the yesteryears, the indomitable
efforts made by 130 crore Indians to overcome those challenges and our collective vision for the future.

We have achieved a lot in the last five years and we want to do lot more. There are two commitments that |
am extremely passionate about- doubling of farmer income and housing for all, by the year 2022. With your
support, lam sure both will happen.

| thank lakhs of alert, committed and patriotic citizens of India, who have enriched the Sankalp Patra with
their valuable inputs. This Sankalp Patra is the voice of the people in the truest sense.

Your vote in 2014 for a strong and decisive government enabled us to fill some of the biggest shortcomings
of five decades of dynastic rule in a short span of just five years. Now that these shortcomings have been
successfully addressed, imagine the pace at which we can workin the times to come.

The next five years are crucial because in 2022, we mark the 75th anniversary of our Independence.
Generations of great women and men laid down their lives so that we could breathe the air of freedom. It is
our sacred duty to create the India of their dreams.

In 2047, our nation would complete a hundred years of freedom. Let us together imagine what is the kind of
India that we want by 2047. The BJP pledges to make the next five years as the foundation laying period for
India of 2047. Let us together lay the foundations of this vision now, and work earnestly towards translating
this vision into a golden reality.

Having seen the work of different political parties and ideologies, the people of India are convinced that if
there is one party that can address their problems, it is the BUP. The Mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' has
resonated across the length and breadth of India. BJP is a party for every Indian. It is a Party that works 24/7
at the grassroots level. That is why, the support we have received has been historic and unprecedented
New India has broken from the shackles of the past. Today, we are a nation that is daring to dream and
dreaming to dare. There is an air of hope anda spirit of aspiration among the youth.

Together, let us work towards building a strong and inclusive India, whose citizens are assured of dignity,
prosperity, security and opportunity.

Vande Mataram! ‘]

Narendra Modi

 

 

Bharatiya Janata Party is committed to Indian values, to making Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan) a reality and to
re-establishing the ideals of nation building. Our promises originate from our five commitments (Panch-
Nishtha). We have an ideology that inspires us to fulfil our promises, which are not just limited to elections
and election manifestos. Inclusive development, good governance, national security, promotion of our
cultural heritage at a global level and continuance of a multi-dimensional progress are the salient features
of our ideology that continues to be a part of our promises and commitments to the nation. None of the
vision documents or manifestos of the Bharatiya Janata Party are either temporary or amere pile of papers.
Every single word written in our manifesto signifies our commitment to the nation and its people.

Bharatiya Janata Party has been active in public sphere for decades guided by the ideological foundation
laid down by Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee and carried forward by Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya through his
mission of Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan). Whenever our party has received the mandate of the Indian people to
govern the country, we have served the people and fulfilled their wishes with full sincerity and commitment.
Under Atalji’s leadership, when the BUP-led NDA government won the mandate to govern the country, our
party ensured that the benefits of development and good governance reach the last citizen at the bottom
of the societal ladder. Antyodaya (Garib Kalyan) remains Bharatiya Janata Party’s path, its resolve and goal.

Today, when we are ushering in the biggest festival of democracy - the General Elections of 2019, | would
like to dwell on the resolves made by the BJP. In 2014, when the BJP presented its Vision Document before
the people, India’s march of development had already been derailed because of the UPA government's
inaction and policy paralysis. It was a phase when the hope of seeing a corruption free and transparent
government realised seemed impossible. Nobody was ready to believe that multi-dimensional
developmental goals could be achieved without resorting to corruption. However, the government led by
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi turned this belief into a reality by successfully running the government in
a transparent manner. We have succeeded in conveying this message to the people at large that
governance is possible without corruption.

In 2014, Shri Narendra Modi emerged as the symbol of the aspirations of the people of India and we made
some promises. Today, when we are at this juncture of elections and facing the electorate, | can assert with
immense pride and satisfaction that the journey of resolves and commitments that began in 2014 will
continue to be carried forward in accordance with the wishes of the people. We have succeeded in kindling
faith towards development in the minds of people and have convinced them that the Narendra Modi led
BJP government is the harbinger of a New India. The same people who used to once say, “Nothing can
happen in this country”, are now hopeful and say, “We can do more” while standing united for the
development of India.

It has been seen in the past that even if a government continues to govern the country for a period of twenty
years, it succeeds in taking one or two historic decisions. In its tenure of five years, the government led by
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been able to take many decisions which are historic and has ushered
in a comprehensive and fundamental transformation. Swachh Bharat Mission, Ujjawala Yojana, Saubhagya
Yojana, Demonetisation, GST, Surgical Strikes, Air Strikes, total electrification, provision for housing for 2.5
crore families, health insurance under Ayushman Bharat for more than 50 crore people and disbursement

 

 

»

of loans to more than 14 crore people under MUDRA Yojana are some of the historic achievements of our
government. The Congress led UPA government could never have dreamt of achieving, let alone envisaging
such watershed policy initiatives. The idea of fulfilling the basic necessities of every ordinary citizen is
intrinsic to our party’s ideology.

In last five years our government has done incredible work in establishing a transparent system of
governance, furthering economic development and increasing people’s participation in the country’s
progress. Today, India is the sixth largest economy in the world and from the point of view of ease of doing
business we have emerged as one of the best destinations in the world. India’s prestige on the global stage
is at an all-time high since Independence. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, we
have been able to make an India that our friends praise, our competitors respect and our enemies fear. India
is now ina position to adopt an independent stand on national security, to successfully strive to strengthen
our Armed Forces and to lead the world in various spheres. In the field of space too, India has emerged asa
global power.

India has been able to convey to the global community the unequivocal message that it considers terrorism
as a serious threat to the world and stands in solidarity for concerted action against the menace of
terrorism. We have also been able to convey that India will instantly give a befitting reply to any act of terror
that is perpetrated against us. The world, today, sees us as a strong and emerging power. Not only have we
succeeded in strengthening our Armed Forces with state-of-the-art defence technologies, but also
become self-reliant in this field.

The General Election of 2019 is an election for carrying forward the multi-dimensional journey of
development started by the Narendra Modi led government. This election is significant because it narrates
the story of a country that has faced historical wrongs before this government came to power in 2014. Itisa
government which has, since then, demonstrated that in the race of development it is not going to stop or
slow down. Inthe journey of aspirations and trust, itis an election to select a government which has one aim
and objective and thatis to continue with the journey of development, good governance and prosperity.

This election is not between two political parties; rather, it is an election to dissipate the negativity that
makes us oblivious of our glorious past and our cultural roots and values. This election is not about victory or
defeat; rather it is an election to reject those opportunists who trample upon the hopes of the common
people for their personal gains. This election is to defeat dynasticism, casteism, communalism and
corruption so that India’s democracy can be infused with greater strength.

In order to ascertain the future of India’s march of development, we have incorporated in our Sankalp the
hopes, aspirations, opinions and suggestions of crores of our fellow citizens. This Vision Document is the
representative document of the expectations of the people of India, it gives voice to their aspirations. To
ensure that the Vision Document of a government that bases itself on people's participation and support,
also reflects their hopes and aspirations, the Manifesto Committee led by Shri Rajnath Singhji had
undertaken a marathon effort. This effort is now before you in the form of the Sankalp Patra. Each member
of the committee and every person associated with the formulation of this document deserves
appreciation.

Friends, this election is not merely to elect a government, it is an election to ensure the country’s national
security, it is an election to propel India to become among the top five economic powers, it is an election to
transform the lives of 50 crore poor Indians, it is an election to take the country forward and to make India
great in the comity of nations.

Come, let us strengthen Shri Narendra Modi’s hands, and resolve to form a full majority BJP government.
With Best Wishes

It gives me immense pride and satisfaction to present to you the Bharatiya Janata Party's vision document,
which is a collection of the hopes and aspirations of every Indian. This document is a compendium of our
promises and commitments that we make to our fellow citizens who stand with us on the journey of
development which India has undertaken since 2014. We have prepared this document after an elaborate
and extensive discussion with people from different regions, communities and classes across the country
through ‘Bharat Ke Mann Ki Baat’, the largest ever collaborative effort to engage citizens in crafting the
roadmap of development for the next five years. These direct suggestions from all across the country form
the core of our vision document for the 2019 elections. The promises that we have made in it are our
commitments to facilitate building a New India.

India has moved on the path of progress at an unprecedented pace after Prime Minister Shri Narendra
Modi-led NDA government won a decisive mandate to form the government and serve the people of India.
Weare bringing to you this document at a time when our country has already embarked on the path of rapid
progress under this government. It is as a result of Shri Modi’s vision of inclusive development and good
governance that we are consistently moving forward and are poised to achieve the goal of building a New
India by 2022.

When the BJP government was formed in 2014, the country was faced with the challenge of turning around
the wheel of development that had been stalled because of rampant corruption, misrule and indecisiveness
of the UPA government, under whose rule the country had been pushed into the darkness of despair. For a
decade, India had a government with no clarity of intentions, lacking strong leadership which could take
crucial decisions and bereft of a policy directive devoted to the welfare of the people. In the last five years,
we have been successful in lifting the country out of the morass of problems inherited from 10 years of
misrule by the UPA government, while also increasing the pace of development.

In the last five years, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the NDA government has
successfully vindicated the mandate that it won in 2014. With the will to transform the hopes of 100 million
of fellow citizens into a solid ‘trust’, we have pledged to take the country forward on the path of progress.

After running a government devoted to the welfare of the common citizen for five years, we can proudly say
that we have not only successfully achieved our goals, but have empowered millions of Indians to become
self-reliant and capable of fulfilling their dreams and aspirations. This government has made historic efforts
made towards empowerment of the ordinary Indian, establishment of a strong and transparent system of
governance andinculcating the spirit of unity and fulfilment of the vision of ‘Ek Bharat ,Shreshtha Bharat’.

In order to achieve the highest goals of agricultural development, we have undertaken the unprecedented
measure of making the agriculture sector ‘farmer centric’. As a result of our efforts in this sector, we are now
moving rapidly towards the goal of doubling the income of farmers by 2022. By increasing the Minimum
Support Price of crops by 1.5 times the cost, we have ensured a fair value for their yield. Through the Prime
Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi, the government has provided financial support to farmers by giving them an
assistance of Rs. 6,000 per year, transferred directly into their bank accounts. The BJP government has also
ensured that adequate warehousing and marketing opportunities are available to farmers, thereby
reducing the chances of risk toa minimum.

In the last five years, the work done by our government for the development and empowerment of every
section of society including women, youth and weaker sections has instilled faith in every citizen that they
can move ahead on the path of progress with dignity. Prior to 2014, numerous projects lay idle for years
because the UPA government had failed to work on them. This, in turn, resulted in the decrease of both the
number and quality of basic amenities for the citizens of our country. By simplifying processes, we have
achieved a historic success in bringing the economy back on track. 'One Nation, One Tax' has become a
milestone in the direction of indirect tax reform. Because of proactive and effective measures taken to
ensure the external and internal security of the country, the Prime Minister Modi-led government has given
rise to a sense of security in the minds of the people. By accomplishing all these tasks, we have presented
the example of an accountable, sensitive and strong-willed government.

The BJP government has always considered people’s participation of utmost importance in good
governance and therefore ensured that people in general were given ample opportunities for participating
in our initiatives and voicing their opinions. With this spirit, we have made an attempt to know ‘Bharat Ke Man
Ki Baat' and taken this into account while defining our work for the next five years and in the formation of our
vision document.

We connected crores of people under the ‘Bharat Ke Man Ki Baat' dialogue which was a nationwide
campaign run by the BJP for a month. Millions of suggestions were shared with us through different means.
Our manifesto is a document of expression of crores of suggestions and aspirations. With the aid of about
7,700 suggestion boxes, 300 rath, more than 100 dialogue program, more than 4000 ‘Bharat Ke Man Ki
Baat' program and through the social media we have made an effort to gauge the ‘Mann ki Baat’ of people
across India. At the same time, we consulted many domain experts, whose suggestions constitute the basis
of this vision document.

This vision document is the vision of an uninterrupted journey upon which we had embarked with the
blessings of the people in 2014. By presenting our achievements in the last five years as a proof of our
dedication, we are firmly committed to continue that journey in the coming five years. This vision document
is our plan of action for achieving these objectives and to fulfil the aspirations of every Indian.

Since this document is inspired by the ‘will of the people’, we dedicate it to the people by reiterating our
unwavering commitment and dedication to the creation of a New India.

Chairperson, Manifesto Committee

 

 
 

TOWARDS A NEW INDIA

As a continuing government, we will build on the foundations laid out in the last five years in terms of re-
establishing macro-economic stability, building long-term frameworks of governance, raising India's
international stature, introducing a non-nonsense approach to internal/external security, upgrading the
stock of physical/social infrastructure and, most importantly, building a basic safety net for the deprived
section of our society. We have demonstrated what all can be achieved by a committed and decisive
leadership that is not afraid to take hard decisions.

Inthe next five years, we promise to create growth opportunities for all citizens in every aspect of life. Sab ka
Saath, Sab ka Vikas remains our guiding principle. We intend to reach out to a developed future while
retaining our civilisational roots.

In order to achieve our long-term goals, we must first secure our country against internal and external
aggression. These threats need to be dealt with at their roots and our decisive leadership that will equip our
security apparatus with all the necessary tools. As we have already demonstrated, we intend to use our
foreign policy, were necessary, in order to tackle the problem of global terrorism. Thus, we intend to
increase the strength of our diplomatic and allied cadres. We will also build on the “Make in India in Defence”
initiative to further indigenise our defense equipment.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised, in his very first speech in Lok Sabha, that this government
would work for the welfare of the poorest. In the last five years, we have created a transparent mechanism
for directly delivering basic services to the bottom of the pyramid by leveraging Aadhaar, DBT and Jan Dhan
accounts. Basic health has been a special focus with large investments made on sanitation (Swachh
Bharat), health insurance (Ayushmaan Bharat) and in modern medical facilities. We intend to accelerate the
pace of providing access to basic amenities such as housing, electricity, toilet, cooking gas, and
health/social security to every poor Indian household, rural and urban, in the next five years and to bring the
percentage of population below the poverty line to single digits.

In the last five years, we re-imposed macro-economic stability while building lasting frameworks for
economic governance. These frameworks include the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, inflation-targeting,
nationwide Goods & Services Tax, and the banking sector clean-up. These efforts have not only changed
the business culture of the country and anchored inflation at 4 percent, but have also been internationally
recognized with a sovereign rating upgrade and a sharp rise in our Ease of Doing Business ranking. We will
ensure that India remains the world's fastest growing major economy in future while maintaining macro-
stability. We aspire to be the world's third largest economy by 2030.

Since our economic model is based on entrepreneurship and innovation, we commit to simplifying and
lowing tax rates. An important aspect of the ease of doing business is the ability to enforce contracts and
resolve disputes. Therefore, we promise to significantly increase the capacity of the legal system within five
years in partnership/co-ordination with the judiciary.

The physical infrastructure of the country has undergone an unprecedented upgrade in the last five years.
We have connected 91% of villages with rural roads, electrified 100% of villages, operationalized 36 new
airports and introduced metro networks in several cities. Looking ahead, we plan to build 60,000 km of
National Highways, connect 100% of villages with rural roads, operationalize 100 new airports, modernize
400 railway stations, and cover 50 cities with metro networks.

Agriculture employs a large proportion of our labour force. In order to ensure remunerative prices for
farmers, the minimum support price for 22 crops was increased to 1.5 times cost of production. In addition,
we have curbed the large-scale diversion of subsidized farm inputs through measures like Neem-coating
of urea, rolled out electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM), provided insurance cover to 14 crore
farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and, most recently, introduced direct income support
for 12 crore farming families through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. In the next five years, we will
create a National Warehousing Grid, invest Rs25 lakh crores in farm/rural productivity, introduce interest-
free Kisan Credit Cards and extend the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi to all farmers. We remain
committed to the promise of doubling farmer incomes by 2022 and more resources will be made available if
necessary.

In the last five years, we have created a national common market for the industry and services sectors. By
lowering inflation and cleaning up the banking system, we are now in a position to structurally lower the real
cost of capital. This is key to a sustained increase in private sector investment. We intend to establish a
National Traders' Welfare Board as well as announce a National Policy for Retail Trade. The tourism sector will
be a special focus. We will make sure that all UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India have facilities of
international standard. We will also identify and promote specific sites of cultural/natural importance as a
national priority (while being sensitive to their preservation).

The cultural, ecological and social capital of a country are just as important as its economic capital. These
too need continuous investment and we intend to expand support for protecting cultural/linguistic
heritage, conserving sites of ecological/historical importance, and promoting our civilizational ideas both
internationally and to the next generation. We reiterate our stand to explore all possibilities within the
framework of the Constitution to facilitate the construction of aRam Temple in Ayodhya.

We remain committed to ensuring the benefits of constitutional provisions to the Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes and backward classes. We recently introduced a further 10% reservation for the
economically backward sections of the non-reserved category. At the same time, we will expeditiously
complete the National Registration of Citizens in Assam and actively consider its extension to other states.

Every society progresses through the empowerment of women, inclusion of minorities and the
encouragement of youth. We will not allow these objectives to be held back by the politics of appeasement.
Therefore, we hope to modernize personal laws to prohibit practices such as Talaq-e-Biddat and Nikah
Halala. We intend to invest in our human potential by focusing on the quality of our primary/secondary
schools as well as expanding our tertiary education capacity. In addition, we will also invest in a select set of
universities and research institutions in order make them world class.

For three generations, India's socio-economic system was held hostage to dynastic perpetuation. This
propagated a corrupt, self-servicing system of political patronage that came to pervade every aspect of
life in India. In 2014, the country voted decisively to end this system. Under the leadership of PM Modi, every
effort has been made to re-establish probity in public life, introduce transparency in policy-making and in
the management of national assets as well as to bring offenders to book.

The above summary is based on the vision of Prime Minister Modi to build a technologically modern,
entrepreneurial, rules-based economy that is secure from external/internal security threats and
simultaneously able to build onits cultural, ecological and social assets.

 

 

Rem

The decisive leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has fundamentally altered the national
security paradigm of India in the last five years. Looking ahead, we propose to do the following:

Zero-Tolerance Approach to Terrorism

Our security doctrine will be guided by our national security interest only. This is exemplified by the
Surgical Strikes and the Air Strikes carried out recently. We will firmly continue our policy of ‘Zero
Tolerance’ against terrorism and extremism and will continue to follow our policy of giving a free hand
to our security forces in combating terrorism.

National Security

Strengthening our Armed Forces - We will speed up the purchases of outstanding defense related
equipments and weapons. In order to equip the Armed Forces with modern equipment, we will
continue to take focused steps to strengthen the strike capability of the Armed Forces.

Self-reliance in defence sector - In order to ensure self-reliance in procurement of defence
equipment, we have taken several effective steps in the last five years. For instance, the most modern
AK-203 automatic rifles are being manufactured at Amethi under our ‘Make in India in Defence’
initiative. We are committed to focus on 'Make in India in Defence’ to enable indigenous production of
defence equipment. This will also generate employment and encourage investment in the defence
sector.

Welfare of Soldiers

We have already demonstrated our commitment to the welfare of our veterans with the
implementation of long delayed OROP. To take this commitment forward, we promise to create a more
effective framework for the resettlement of our Armed Forces veterans. Under this effort, the Armed
Forces will start planning for the resettlement of soldiers three years before their retirement and in
accordance with their preferences. This will include provision for skills training, soft skills training,
financial support for higher education, for housing and for starting an enterprise.

Modernization of Police Forces

We will continue to take forward the process of modernizing the Central Armed Police Forces to
further increase their capacity and readiness and enable them to effectively combat internal security
challenges.

We will provide assistance to the states to upgrade their police forces through the ‘Scheme for
Modernization of Police Forces’. We will encourage expedited police reforms in the states so as to
enable the State police forces to deal with new types of crimes like cyber crime and help them to be
more sensitive to the citizens, especially the weak and vulnerable sections of the society.

Combating Infiltration

There has been a huge change in the cultural and linguistic identity of some areas due to illegal
immigration, resulting in an adverse impact on local people's livelihood and employment. We will
expeditiously complete the National Register of Citizens process in these areas on priority. In future we
willimplement the NRC ina phased manner in other parts of the country.

We will continue to undertake effective steps to prevent illegal immigration in the Northeastern states.
For this, we will further strengthen our border security. A pilot project on the use of technology to
strengthen border security (Smart Fencing) was implemented in Dhubri (Assam). We will implement
this onall borders.

 

Reinforcing Border Security

We will focus on creation of developmental and other necessary infrastructure in border areas to
ensure that border security is strengthened, and to enable increased participation of and benefits for
border areas in the country’s development and progress.

We have completed building six integrated check-posts with another under construction to facilitate
easier trade and travel from the neighboring countries. We will further ease the movement of goods
and people by constructing 14 more integrated check-posts by 2024. After completion of all the
proposed integrated check-posts, all trade movement with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan will be
conducted through the integrated check-posts.

Coastal Safety

After effectively strengthening coastal security through implementation of a coastal security scheme
to provide modern equipment and allocating funds to the states for establishing coastal police
stations, establishment of National Committee for Strengthening Maritime & Coastal Security, Island
Information System and National Academy of Coastal Policing, we will continue to take steps for
ensuring security of India’s long coastline.

Citizenship Amendment Bill

We are committed to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Bill for the protection of
individuals of religious minority communities from neighbouring countries escaping persecution. We
will make all efforts to clarify the issues to the sections of population from the Northeastern states who
have expressed apprehensions regarding the legislation. We reiterate our commitment to protect the
linguistic, cultural and social identity of the people of Northeast. Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs and
Christians escaping persecution from India’s neighbouring countries will be given citizenship in India.

Combating Left Wing Extremism

We have already taken strong actions to reduce left wing extremism to a very large extent and limited
them to small pockets. We are committed to taking necessary and effective steps against left wing
extremism to eliminate this menace in the next five years. In the last five years, we have focussed on
the development of economic and social infrastructure such as roads, mobile towers, schools and
medical facilities in the tribal areas affected by left wing extremism and we will continue to make
efforts in this direction.

Jammu & Kashmir- Article 370

* Inthe last five years, we have made all necessary efforts to ensure peace in Jammu and Kashmir
through decisive actions and a firm policy. We are committed to overcome all obstacles that come
in the way of development and provide adequate financial resources to all the regions of the state.
We reiterate our position since the time of the Jan Sangh to the abrogation of Article 370.

« We are committed to annulling Article 35A of the Constitution of India as the provision is
discriminatory against non-permanent residents and women of Jammu and Kashmir. We believe
that Article 35A is an obstacle in the development of the state. We will take all steps to ensure a safe
and peaceful environment for all residents of the state. We will make all efforts to ensure the safe
return of Kashmiri Pandits and we will provide financial assistance for the resettlement of refugees
from West Pakistan, Pakistan occupied Jammu and Kashmir (POJK) and Chhamb.

 
  
 

India supports peace,
but the country will not hesitate to take
any steps required for national security

mechanism for agriculture produce

¢ Our Pradhan Mantri Krishi SAMPADA Yojana highlights our focus on warehousing as a means of
increasing farmers’ income. To further expand the warehousing infrastructure in the country, we
will establish a National Warehousing Grid along National Highways to ensure necessary logistical
linkages for warehousing of agricultural produce.

* Toenable the farmer to store the agri-produce near his village and sell at a remunerative price at an
appropriate time, we will roll out a new Village Storage Scheme of agri-produce. We will provide
farmers with loans at cheaper rates on the basis of storage receipt of the agri-produce.

To ensure greater promotion and increase profitability under organic farming, we will take the
following steps:

« We will promote chemical-free organic farming in an additional 20 lakh hectare of hilly, tribal and
rainfed areas in the next 5 years.

* Wewilllauncha dedicated e-commerce portal to enhance the availability of organic produce to the

« Promotion of organic eco-tourism in the vicinity of organic farming will also ensure additional
income to the farmers.

National Bee-keeping and Honey Mission: We will launch a National Bee-keeping and Honey
Mission to ensure additional returns to the farmers. We will double the honey production from the
present 1,15,000 MT by developing infrastructural facilities and providing marketing support.

Expanding Irrigation in Mission Mode

We have completed work on the long-pending 31 irrigation projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi
Sinchai Yojana and work will soon be completed on the remaining 68 projects in phases up to
December 2019. Continuing our efforts to developing irrigation, we will further expand Pradhan Mantri
Krishi Sinchai Yojana to realize 100% irrigation potential of the country within a defined time-frame.

We will bring one crore hectares agricultural land under micro-irrigation, this would be supplemented
with ‘fertigation’ to promote judicious use of fertilizers.

Cooperatives

We recognize the role of cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) can play in ensuring
better market linkages and opportunities in the agricultural sector and we are committed to support
and strengthen them.

We will enable the creation of 10,000 new Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) by 2022 to ensure
economies of scale for farmers regarding access to inputs and markets.

To cater to the needs of big cities we will set up a mechanism of direct marketing of vegetables, fruits,
dairy and fishery products through farmers’ cooperative organizations so as to ensure better price
return to the farmers.

Convergence of Agriculture and Technology

rental/custom hiring basis.

We will extensively use technology to ensure a better knowledge of the market prices of various agro-
products for the benefit of farmers.

We will enable development of young agri-scientists to take advantage of Artificial Intelligence,
Machine Learning, Blockchain technology, Big Data analytics etc. for more predictive and profitable
precision agriculture.

We view solar energy as an additional source of income for farmers and will encourage solar farming
on a massive scale so as to enable the ‘Annadaata’(food provider) to become ‘Urja-daata’ (energy
provider).

Digitization of Land Records - On the lines of Aachaar project, we will complete digitization of land
records on a mission mode. We will implement second-generation land reforms to ensure title
guarantee for the landholder and reduce land-related litigation. We will create a model law for
conclusive titling (in consultation with states) promoting title guarantee and title insurance and work
with States to implement this system.

 

We have given utmost importance to the dairy sector and have established Kamdhenu Aayog for the
conservation of indigenous species of cows. We will establish a network of mobile veterinary
dispensaries to provide doorstep service to farmers.

We will roll out a model programme for periodic health checkup of all cattle and other domestic
animals at the district level with the help of veterinary experts from the public and private sector.

We will expand the coverage of immunization and eliminate Foot and Mouth Disease and Brucellosis.

We will launch a National Feed and Fodder Mission to eliminate the shortage of fodder.

On the Path of Gram Swaraj

Gram Swaraj is one of the principal pillars of Mahatma Gandhi's vision of India. As we approach the
150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Bharatiya Janata Party resolves to realize his vision of
Gram Swaraj by ensuring that everyone has equitable access to resources. As India reaches the
defining milestone of the 75th year of its independence in 2022, we pledge to adopt the ideals of Gram
Swaraj as envisaged by Mahatma Gandhi. Inline with this vision we promise:

India as the World’s 3rd Largest Economy

Roadmap for 5 trillion dollar economy

India was branded as ‘fragile five’ in 2014. Within five years, we have turned India into a bright spot that
is not only the fastest growing major economy of the world but also enjoys macroeconomic stability.
We have already become the world’s sixth largest economy and will soon be among the top five. We
aspire to make India the third largest economy of the world by 2030. This implies that we commit to
make IndiaaUS $5 trillion economy by 2025 and US $ 10 trillion economy by 2032.

When compared to all governments post-1991, this government has delivered the highest rate of
average GDP growth (7.3%) over the last five years and maintained lowest rate of average consumer
inflation (4.6%). The consumer inflation is presently at 2.6%. This has been achieved with lower fiscal
deficits and significantly lower current account deficit as a percentage of GDP. Average fiscal deficit
as a percentage of GDP during 2014-19 has been brought down to 3.7% from 5.4% during 2009-14.
Reduction in fiscal deficit of this order implies less burden of debt on future generations by almost
Rs.16 lakh crores. Average Current account deficit as a percentage of GDP during this government has
been reduced to 1.5% from 3.3% during 2009-14.

Tax Policy

Our economic policy has been guided by the principle of lowering the tax rate and improving
compliance; thereby broadening of the tax base. With improved compliance and increased tax base,
the tax to GDP ratio has reached 12%, highest in the recent past, up from 10.1% in 2013-14. This
increased revenue has been deployed for benefits to the poor and creation of infrastructure at an
unprecedented level. We will continue with our policy in the similar manner — lowering of tax rate
thereby rewarding honest tax payers and improving compliance.

Goods and Service Tax

Goods and Service Tax (GST) has resulted in overall lowering of tax rates and increased revenue
collection, particularly for States. When compared to base year of 2015-16, GST revenue for all states
have increased by 50% in three years. We will continue with the simplification of GST process by
engaging in dialogue with all stakeholders.

100 lakh crore Investment

While social security net for the poor and farmers will be expanded, we will take up capital investment
in the country to a new height. By 2024, we will make capital investment of Rs.100 lakh crore in the
infrastructure sector. We recognize that investment driven growth requires cheaper cost of capital. By
anchoring inflation at 4% and cleaning up our banking system we have created the space for structural
reduction in the cost of capital. This will not only help infrastructure investment but investment also in
the wider economy. Thus, new India will be built on the basis of investment driven growth.

 

@

 

Make In India

With the aim of developing India into a knowledge based, skill supported and technology driven
society, we have launched the ‘Make in India’ campaign. A beginning has already been made through
our initiatives like Digital India, Startup India and Skill India. To bring in fast and inclusive growth, we
have also carried out substantial reforms in the last few years in terms of de-regulation and de-
licensing, with an aim to improve ease of doing business. More than 90% FDI approvals are now
through the automatic route. FDI has grown by almost 50% in the last five years. Similarly,
implementation of One Nation, One Tax through GST has brought all businesses under single tax net.

Making India a global manufacturing hub - as we position India as a global manufacturing hub over
the next five years, we will take the following steps:

* Top 50 Ranking in Ease of Doing Business Index- In the last four years, India has climbed 65 places
in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index. We will further work in this direction to take the
country’s ranking into the top 50.

* Strengthening Companies Act - In order to incentivize compliance of law and ease of doing
business, we will amend the Companies Act to impose civil liability for technical and procedural
defaults of aminor nature thus unclogging the majority of the cases from the courts.

¢ New Industrial Policy - We will announce a new industrial policy to improve competitiveness of
manufacturing and services with an eye on Industry 4.0 in order to gear up for technologies like
artificial intelligence and electric mobility. Special effort will be made for MSMEs.

« Network Approach for Growth - We understand that clustering and network effects are
important in order to build competitiveness in cutting edge industries. Therefore, we will invest in
creating clusters/networks that can take on the world’s best. Public procurement and
governmentincentives will be used actively to build up these clusters and encourage job creation.

Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises

Aspecial package was launched by the Government to boost the MSME sector. The Credit Guarantee
Scheme of the Government of India is an important component wherein loans to MSME are
guaranteed. Under this alone, the credit of around Rs.19,000 crore was achieved in 2017-18. We would
aim to take this figure to Rs.1,00,000 crore by 2024.

Technology access and upgradation are key elements in the MSME sector. Our government has taken
amajor step in expanding of ‘Technology Centres’ and we would achieve more than 150 such centres
all over the country by 2024. These Technology Centres would help in mentoring skilling and proto-
typing of MSMEs. They will expose MSMEs to Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Internet of Things, Virtual
Reality, BlockChain technology and Zero Defect Zero Effect.

The Technology Centres, other skilling centres of MSMEs and NSICs incubation centres alone would
provide focussed and high level skilling to more than 6 lakh people per year.

Welfare of Small Traders -

¢ Wewill establish National Traders’ Welfare Board and create a National Policy for Retail Trade for
the growth of retail businesses.

* Toprotect the interests of small traders, we will provide an accident insurance of 10 lakh rupees to
all the traders registered under GST.

* On the lines of Kisan credit card, we will also create a scheme to give merchant credit card to
registered merchants.

 

 

Entrepreneurship & StartUps

To encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship amongst the youth, we will launch a new scheme to
provide collateral-free credit up to 50 lakh for entrepreneurs. We will guarantee 50% of the loan
amount for female entrepreneurs and 25% of the loan amount for male entrepreneurs.

India is now among the largest Startup ecosystems of the world. We will further strengthen this
ecosystem by:

¢ Easing regulatory requirement for start-ups

* Targeting time spent for tax compliance at 1hour per month

* Facilitating establishment of 50,000 newStartups in the nation by 2024
¢ Creating 100 Innovation Zones in Urban Local Bodies

* Setting up 500 new incubators and accelerators by 2024

¢ Initiating ranking of Central Ministries, departments, State Governments and CPSUs for their
increased engagement with start-ups and in bringing in innovation and newer technologies and
global practices and skills.

We will continue to promote and encourage Startups through creation of a ‘Seed Startup Fund’ of
%20,000 crore.

We will support entrepreneurial ventures started by individuals from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
Tribes, Other Backward Communities, or Economically Weaker Sections and take forward the ‘Stand-
up India’ initiative.

We will set-up new ‘Entrepreneurial Northeast’ scheme to provide financial support to the micro, small
and medium industries and for employment generation in the Northeastern state.

Using Tourism to Cluster Services

Within the services sector, tourism will be special focus because it brings together many different
service segments.

In particular, we will identify specific places of cultural or natural importance in order to develop them
as comprehensive destinations instead of leaving them as isolated sites. This requires that we look at
transport connection, heritage conservation, hotels, restaurants, entertainment and other services in
an integrated way. We will make an effort to ensure that all these services interconnect. Therefore, the
government will make sure that schemes/ agencies such as Swachh Bharat, ASI, forest department
and local government work together with the travel and hospitality industry. All UNESCO heritage
sites in India willbe upgraded to international level facilities.

The North eastern states and our Island/coastal areas will be developed while being sensitive to
conserving their ecological uniqueness. Similarly, places of cultural importance will be developed
while maintaining their unique heritage. As we have recently demonstrated by projects in Varanasi, an
effort will be made to upgrade these sites while being sensitive to their historical/cultural heritage.

Transparent economy

We will continue our crackdown on Benami properties and illegal foreign bank accounts to benefit
honest taxpayers and the poor of the country. We will also expedite our actions to bring fugitive
economic offenders back to India and prosecute them for their crimes.

International Trade

We will ensure faster customs clearance of international cargo by relaxing clearance procedures,
introducing self-declaration etc and adopting new scanning technology. We will also provide
adequate financial and institutional support for exporters and export organizations to build capacity
and equip them with adequate information to ensure unhindered exports.

 

 

Infrastructure]

Foundation for New India

Infrastructure is the backbone of any economy. In the 10 years of UPA rule, policy paralysis and
corruption had derailed infrastructural development. The last five years, under the leadership of Prime
Minister Modi, infrastructural roll out has been put back on track. For the first time, India has started
marching and is being seen on the path of global standards in infrastructure and civic amenities. The
speed of constructing rural roads has doubled and 90% of rural road connectivity has been achieved.
Furthermore, India has become a net exporter of electricity and has achieved maximum production of
coal and maximum distribution of LED bulbs. There has been an unprecedented rise in the port
capacity and the speed of setting up new rail lines, gauge conversion, and electrification of railway
tracks has doubled. We have invested at an unprecedented level in building infrastructure in the last
five years. This includes massive budgetary allocation for railways, highways, village roads and other
health as well as educational infrastructure. We have also started and matured into a new technology
driven platform called PRAGATI (Pro-active Governance and Timely Implementation). Through this,
mechanism, we are de-bottlenecking major projects on a regular basis through video conference with
officials across the country. Going forward,

We will aim at next generation infrastructure which will include gas grids and water grids, i-ways,
regional airports and way side amenities along National highways.

We will continue the fast pace with more and more public and private investment and efficient ground
level management on building of infrastructure further and to improve the quality of life and enhance
the ease of living.

In addition to ensuring efficiency in the economy this will also lead to creation of a large number of jobs
andlivelihood opportunities.

Ensuring Urban Development

Through the development of infrastructure and connectivity, we will ensure the further development
of suburban townships and new urban centres.

We will set up five regional centres of excellence on urban issues. These centres will provide support to
states and local bodies on issues of urban governance and growth.

Urban Mobility -We will launch a National Urban Mobility Mission to provide technology based urban
mobility solutions to all urban local bodies and increase the use of public transport, enhance
walkability and cycle use. Under this mission, we will incentivize cities to integrate the public transport
systems such as metro, local trains and local buses with the private service providers inthe sector such
as, private bus operator, private taxi operator, the auto-rickshaw, e-rickshaw services, pedestrian and
cycling infrastructure for a seamless and smooth last mile connectivity. We will also promote a
common mobility card/ ticketing across different modes of transport.

Inthe next five years, we will ensure that 50 cities are covered witha strong metro network.

Swachh Bharat Mission

We have constructed over 9 crore toilets under our flagship programme, Swachh Bharat Mission. We
will take the Mission to a new level through sustainable Solid Waste Management in every village.
Through the mission, we will ensure 100% disposal of liquid waste through emphasis on faecal sludge
management and reuse of waste water in rural, peri urban and unsewered areas.

We will ensure that all habitations attain open defecation free status and those that have attained the
status sustain the behavioural change.

Jal Shakti

Water is a critical resource but its management is spread across various departments, even at the
Central level. We will form a new Ministry of Water unifying the water management functions to
approach the issue of water management holistically and ensure better coordination of efforts. The
Ministry will expeditedly take forward the ambitious programme, conceptualized by Shri Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, for linking rivers from different parts of the country and ensure a solution to the problems of
drinking water and irrigation. We will initiate work on this programme by constituting an authority.

We will launch ‘Jal Jivan Mission’ under which we will introduce a special programme, ‘Nal se Jal’ to
ensure piped water for every household by 2024.

We will ensure sustainability of water supply through special focus on conservation of rural water
bodies and ground water recharge.

Road Connectivity

In continuation to our existing milestone of constructing roads at an unprecedented pace, we will
construct 60,000 kms of National Highways in the next five years.

We will double the length of National Highways by 2022.

We will complete the Phase-1 of Bharatmala Project expeditiously. We will also launch Bharatmala 2.0
project especially with a view to support the states to develop state road networks connecting the
interior regions to the main roads and to effectively leverage the economic potential and market
opportunities of the concerned regions.

We will bring in new technologies and designs in road construction, operation and maintenance.

We want to become a world leader in e-mobility. 10,000 crores have already been allocated to launch
a programme for promoting clean energy and battery operated vehicles. We will further work on this
front to ensure expansion of this new mobility experience.

Railways

We have made all efforts to make the experience of rail journey safe, smooth, clean and satisfying and
have achieved great results. We will continue the pace of work in this regard and encourage private
participation in the development of railway amenities and infrastructure and provision of services.

We will ensure conversion of all viable rail tracks to broad gauge by 2022.
We will make all efforts to ensure electrification of all railway tracks by 2022.

We will expand connectivity and experience of high speed trains and new version trains such as Vande
Bharat Express across the length and breadth of the country in the next five years.

We will complete the dedicated freight corridor project by 2022.
We will launcha massive programme for modernization of railway stations in the country.

We will equip all main railway stations with Wi-Fi facility by 2022.

Establishment of New Airports

In 2014 there were 65 functional airports and there are a total of 101 functional airports today. In the
next five years, we will double the number of functional airports.

Coastal Development

Potential of coastal development for transportation, tourism and for economic upliftment of coastal
communities has remained unexploited in the country. To exploit this potential fully, we have launched
theSagarmala programme and will ensure speedy completion of the projects under this programme.

We will double our port capacity in the next five years.

We will further encourage integrated development of coastal areas including coastal cities, coastal
transport and coastal industrialization.

We will undertake the upgradation of infrastructure for connecting the coast and hinterland to ensure
smooth transportation.

We will continue to focus on development of inland waterways for shifting inland cargo movement
from road and rail to water transport.

Energy

We had made a commitment to provide 24x7 electricity to all and the country has substantially
attained the goal. All remaining villages have been electrified. Similarly, almost all remaining
households have been provided with an electricity connection. Thus, we are near completion of our
promise in a record time. We will further work towards completing any unfinished task in this regard.

Exceptional work has been done in adding to the electricity generated and in laying down of
transmission lines and in putting up the nationwide transmission grid. With these milestone
achievements, India can now claim that quantum of or access to electricity is no longer an issue. In fact,
India has also become anet exporter of electricity. Now, we will work towards:

¢ Ensuring aright mix of energy which leads towards a cleaner environment
* Supplying quality electricity to allconsumers
* Making the state electricity entities financially sound and administratively more efficient.

India has become a global champion in addressing the issues of climate change through effective and
feasible interventions. We have achieved cumulative installed renewable energy capacity of 76.87 GW
as on February, 2019 and are on track to achieve our goal of 175 GW by 2022. We will continue our
efforts in this regard and make it a popular movement. We will further make all efforts to invite other
countries of the world to become members of the International Solar Alliance.

Digital Connectivity

Every Gram Panchayat will be connected with high speed optical fibre network by 2022. Through
village level high speed broadband services, we will provide a range of services such as telemedicine,
tele-education and agriculture related advisories.

Healthy India - Determined India

Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi took a historic step last year through the roll out of Ayushman Bharat
the World’s largest healthcare programme. In addition, we have conceived and implemented
programmes for controlling prices of medicines, and significantly expanding Medical education. We
are committed to leverage all resources to ensure that the out-of-pocket expenditure on health is
reduced andall citizens can avail necessary medical services.

Making Healthcare Accessible

While providing annual health cover of Rs. 5 lakh to 10.74 crore poor families under the Pradhan Mantri
Jan Arogya Yojana under Ayushman Bharat, we also initiated a programme to set up 1,50,000 Health
and Wellness Centres (HWCs) by 2022. Till date 17,150 HWCs have become functional. We will take up
the programme of HWCs to next level. We will target provisioning of telemedicine and diagnostic
laboratory facilities at these HWCs by 2022 to ensure quality primary medical care to the poor at his
doorstep.

We will create an essential devices list and a separate pricing policy for medical devices to ensure their
accessibility and affordability to masses.

Strengthening Health Infrastructure

With our initiatives, we have successfully reached the stage of ensuring one Medical College for every
three Parliamentary Constituencies. We will take it forward and set up one Medical College or Post
Graduate Medical College in every district, through public or private participation, by 2024. To start
with 75 such Medical Institutes will be set up by 2022. This would ensure availability and accessibility
of quality secondary and tertiary medical care to the citizens across the diverse landscape of our
country.

In a mere span of 5 years, we have increased the number of MBBS seats by 18,000 and that of Post-
graduate Medical seats by 12,000. We would further accelerate the pace of reforms in medical
education sector so as to ensure transparency on one hand and improved doctor: population ratio on
the other hand. With our efforts we will double the number of MBBS and Specialist doctors in the
country by 2024 as compared to the work done from 1947 till2014. Further, we will also accelerate the
reforms in para-medical education sector so as to increase the availability of nurses, pharmacists and
other paramedical personnel.

We will also accelerate the reforms in paramedical education sector so as to increase the availability of
nurses, pharmacists and other paramedical personnel.

Immunization and Nutrition

@_ We will endeavour to make the National Nutrition Mission a mass movement and strengthen

 

infrastructure and capacity in all Anganwadis.

The Mission Indradhanush programme has ensured full immunization of 3.39 crore children and 87.18
lakh pregnant mothers. Further, the annual increase in the rate of immunization has jumped from 1%
per year to 6% per year. Continuing this pace, we will ensure full immunization coverage for all the
children and pregnant women by 2022.

Eliminating Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis claims more lives every year than any other infectious disease. As on today, more than 25
lakh citizens are suffering from TB while over 3 lakh persons die due to TB every year. The disease
mainly affects the poor and malnourished. We have rolled out a Special Mission to eliminate TB from
India by 2025. We will ensure this becomes a success much ahead of the target given in Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs)

erica Governance

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has always maintained that Good Governance is the cornerstone of
good politics. In the last five years, we have put in place a framework of governance which will yield rich
dividends over the next generation.

Simultaneous Elections

We are committed to the idea of simultaneous elections for Parliament, State assemblies and local
bodies to reduce expenditure, ensure efficient utilisation of government resources and security
forces and for effective policy planning. We will try to build consensus on this issue with all parties.

Single Voter List - In order to ensure that every citizen gets the right to exercise his/her franchise for all
public bodies and to avoid confusion created by multiple voter lists, we will strive to ensure acommon
voter list for all elections.

Corruption-free Bharat

In order to curb corruption, the Modi government has taken many effective steps such as enacting the
Fugitive Economic Offenders Act,2018, Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act,2018, and the
Benami Transaction Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 2016. We have eliminated inertia in the government
by ensuring decisive actions under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and will continue to make
efforts to ensure more effective governance and transparent decision making.

Civil Service and Governance Reforms

To transform India into a developed nation, we need to work with the guiding principle of “Minimum
Government and Maximum Governance” and we will bring reform in the Civil Services and implement
it in a manner to achieve the same. In order to ensure better implementation of policies and
coordination, we will merge similar and complementary departments into sectoral ministries. This will
allow policymakers to frame holistic and comprehensive policies on the one hand and ensure smooth
implementation on the other.

We will continue to implement the Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan in a focussed manner to build the
capacity of members of Panchayati Raj Institutions and ensure effective delivery of schemes at the
grassroots.

Police reforms

Police is the most basic and key functionary affecting the people’s life. An effective policing and
peaceful law and order is the key to growth and development. Our present police and policing is based
upon the colonial police force and there is a need to change and transform the police according to the
challenges of the 21st century. Therefore, we will bring Police Reform. We will formulate a ‘Model Police
Act’ in consultation with the States to have a pro-people citizen friendly police. This will take the Indian
policing at par with its contemporaries anywhere in the world.

Judicial Reforms

We will work towards simplifying procedural laws, encouraging mediation and strengthening judicial
and court management system in order to increase accessibility.

for creating an International Financial Services Centre Authority which will put in place a robust
regulatory framework. We will continue and further increase the ongoing incentives to expand digital
transactions.

Implementing Cooperative Federalism Effectively

We have set an example of inclusive federal governance through steps such as the creation of NITI
Aayog, establishment of the GST council and restructuring of central schemes in line with our pledge
of cooperative federalism. We will continue to pursue this course by ensuring greater involvement of
the states in all aspects of policy making and governance thereby strengthening federalism. We will
also ensure implementation of the 14th Finance Commission’s recommendations.

Ease of Living

We will set up a committee for Easing Citizens’ Interactions with Government (CECIG) to work with
experts in reforming citizen’s interface with Government across domains such as taxes, business
compliance, rules and regulations for greater simplicity and ease.

To empower citizens and ensure time-bound delivery of public services, we will explore every avenue
toimplement the Right to Service.

Science and Technology

The future belongs to Science and Technology and the use of technology for development of people.
We will launch a new Science Mission for development of cutting edge technologies and future
technologies with two submissions, specifically focused on (a) artificial intelligence mission and (b)
robotic research mission with the aim to leapfrog into the future world of cutting edge technologies.

Our first agenda is our people. Today much of our S&T investment is in central institutions. We will aim
to spread this to the 95% of students who attend state government institutions also. This will be done
by investment from the government through a National Research Foundation in partnership with
States. Industry investment in R&D will also be enhanced, in partnership with our network of national
laboratories.

We will launch a Language Translation Mission that will enable ready translation of English text in
Science & Technology and humanities in any of our languages. This will take the best works, bilingually,
to every student in the country.

We will initiate a genome mission for human health that will bring the latest diagnosis and treatment to
our entire population through frugal innovation.

We will explore the diversity of our oceans, have a human crewed submersible going to the deepest
oceans that will facilitate sustainable use of resources. With a thrust on non-fossil fuels, our research
mission in this area will reduce imports and make India a leader innew technologies.

The supercomputer, Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Missions will make India not only Industry 5.0
ready but also a leader. The Swachh Bharat mission has transformed one side of Swachhata. Now we
will get the latest technologies to transform Waste to Energy and Wealth in a major mission. We will also
strive towards semiconductor manufacturing within the country.

 

25

 

After achieving unprecedented success through Mission Shakti, we are committed to ensuring that
‘Gaganyaan' successfully demonstrates our scientific capabilities of executing a manned mission in
space. We will start the ‘National Program for Rapid Research in Socially Contextual Technologies’ to
create research paths in desirable technologies and to manage financing of such projects in
coordination with the private sector.

Forest and Environment

We have ensured speed and effectiveness in issuing forest and environmental clearances for eligible
projects due to which we have added around 9000 Sq. Kms to the forest cover of the country. We are
committed to maintaining this pace through adoption of cleaner practises to make our nation a
greener country.

We have evolved technologically better strategies and devices to map the level of pollution in cities
and rivers and have taken effective steps to reduce the level of pollution in major cities, including the
national capital. We will convert the National Clean Air Plan into a Mission and we will focus on 102 most
polluted cities in the country. Through concerted action, we will reduce the level of pollution in each of
the mission cities by at least 35% over the next five years.

We have continuously protected and promoted the interest of forest dwellers particularly the tribal
communities. We have endeavoured to provide basic amenities, such as roads, telephone connectivity
and cooking gas connection in addition to houses and toilets, at the doorstep of people living in
remotest forest areas. We are committed to continuing our workin this direction.

Protecting the Himalayas

We will ensure the Himalayan States are provided special financial assistance in the form of a ‘Green
Bonus 'to facilitate the protection and promotion of forests in those states.

Focussing on Island Territories

We have taken important steps such as establishing the Island Development Authority to ensure the
overall development of the island regions. We will continue to focus on these areas given their
economic potential and strategic importance.

We will preserve the unique identity of Andaman-Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands and build a world-
class infrastructure compatible with the local ecosystem. We will focus on fully developing the
potential of tourism in these islands to bring transformational improvement in the standard of living
andincome of the residents.

Focussing on Union Territories

We will develop Union Territories as models of development and good governance, and ensure the
highest quality of living, citizen services and infrastructure for the residents of Union Territories.

Development of Northeastern States

We have ensured that the insurgency in the Northeastern States is brought under control and the
security situation in these states improved significantly. We will leverage this situation to ensure
accelerated development of the Northeastern states.

We will continue to focus on the development of infrastructure and improved connectivity in this
region to ensure that the Northeastern states duly participate in the economic progress of the
country. We will continue to take the necessary steps to leverage the tremendous potential of hydro-
electric, tourism, horticulture etc in the Northeastern states.

We are committed to ensure that the unique linguistic, cultural and social identity of the Northeas
States is adequately protected and take steps to ensure the same.

Yuva Bharat - Tomorrow’s India

We need to create stepping stones for the next-generation in order to ensure that they can participate
more fully in building New India.

Creating Opportunities for Youth

We will create new opportunities of employment by providing more support to the 22 major
‘Champion Sectors’ identified as the main drivers of Indian economy. We will optimally leverage the
untapped employment-generation of potential of sectors such as defence and pharmaceuticals to
take advantage of the opportunities available in domestic and foreign markets.

Entrepreneurship & StartUps- To encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship amongst the youth, we
willtake the following steps:

* Wewill launch anew scheme to provide collateral-free credit up to 50 lakh for entrepreneurs. We
will guarantee 50% of the loan amount for female entrepreneurs and 25% of the loan amount for
male entrepreneurs.

* Wewill set-up new ‘Entrepreneurial Northeast’ scheme to provide financial support to the micro,
small and medium industries and for employment generation in the Northeastern state.

¢ More than 17 crore entrepreneurs have availed loans under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. We
will expand this initiative further to take the number of beneficiaries of Mudra loans up to 30 crore.

* Wewill continue to promote and encourage Startups through creation of a ‘Seed Startup Fund’ of
20,000 crore.

Youth In Governance

Engaging Youth with Society - To ensure increased participation of youth in our society, we will take
the following steps:

* Wewillincentivise and reward self-organized groups of youth who adopt social assets like schools,
hospitals, lakes, public gardens etc. and ensure their maintenance and cleanliness to encourage
greater civic engagement of the youth.

* We will launch a special awareness and treatment programme for de-addiction among youth to
protect them from the harmful effects of substance abuse and addiction

Youth in Urban Governance - We will support a large scale internship programme for the youth in
urban local bodies, matching skills needed by the local bodies and providing the young with much
needed understanding of urbanissues.

Sports

We will map state and district-wise sport talent and strengths, recognize the traditional sporting
practices and focus on the promotion of specific sports in specific regions.

Our government has taken comprehensive steps to develop the culture of sports in the country
through the 'Khelo India’ scheme, and we will continue to provide adequate resources under this
scheme to ensure the achievement of declared objectives. Under this scheme, special attention will be
given to encourage sporting talent among women and tribals.

 

27

In order to further promote sports, we will introduce practical sports courses as part of the educational
curriculum and also establish a National Sports Education Board for the development of
sportspersons.

& We will support the creation of a mini-stadium in each sub-district, with the participation of state
governments, to encourage sports and to make sporting infrastructure available in the rural areas.

@ We will formulate a mechanism to ensure that the capacity of existing sporting infrastructure is easily
accessible for use of sportspersons and new models including PPP will be explored to ensure
maintenance and management of such assets.

® We will promote the Fit India campaign as an integral part of building a culture of sports in India and will
consistently undertake necessary steps to encourage broader awareness and participation in the
campaign.

 
  
 
 
 
 
  

India is a youthful country.

A country with such a major
percentage of youth has the
capability to change not only
its own, but the fate of the
entire world.

creek for All

While keeping the education system in pace with modern trends and knowledge, our efforts will
continue to be oriented towards ensuring a global, scientific, outcome-focused, knowledge-oriented,
accessible, inclusive and student-friendly education system in order to ensure that students can
optimally benefit from the education system.

Primary and Secondary Education

Having achieved access and equity in school education, our emphasis will now be on quality of
learning. We have already identified learning outcomes for various classes and our priority in the next
five years will be to ensure that children achieve these learning outcomes. We will focus on teachers
training and capacity building as a key factor in achieving these learning outcomes.

We consider it our duty to provide a conducive environment for talented children in our country to
facilitate them to unleash their talent. For this, we will initiate a ‘Prime Minister Innovative Learning
Program’ to bring together such children for a certain period in a year in one place from all over the
country and provide them with facilities and resources for them to excel. This would instill a culture of
lateral thinking and innovation among them.

We will establish National Institutes of Teachers’ training. These institutions would provide four-year
integrated courses that would set the standards for quality teachers in our schools. We will also
motivate States to replicate this model as it is our firm belief that quality teachers lay the foundation of
quality learning.

We are committed to using technology in classrooms and in imparting education. We will move ahead
to provide smart classes to our children in schools. To begin with, we will initiate this process in the
secondary classrooms.

Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas have done yeoman service in the field of school
education. In order to cater to the demands of more such schools, we aim to open another 200 such
schools by 2024.

Higher Education

We will take all necessary steps to increase the number of seats in Central Law, Engineering, Science
and Management institutions by at least 50% in the next five years. We will also motivate States to
accordingly increase the number of seats in State institutions.

We have given due emphasis to on-line courses as a medium of delivering education in the last five
years. We will take it to the next level and make it a major resource for imparting higher education.

While we have world-class Technology, Science and Medical institutions, the same needs to be
replicated in other areas. We will set up an Arts, Culture and Music University with a focus on fine arts
suchas music and dance. We will also open a state-of-the-art Hospitality and Tourism University anda
Police University. States will be encouraged to establish similar institutions of excellence.

We will relook the role of existing regulatory institutions’ and make necessary changes in the
legislation to ensure a regulatory overhaul. We will formulate new regulatory mechanism to provide
autonomy to quality institutions and focus towards setting national standards. It will work towards
promoting excellence and quality learning in higher education while providing academic and
functional autonomy to institutions.

 

29

In the past five years, our emphasis has been on quality higher educational institutions and Institutions
of Eminence have been a step in that direction. We will take it forward in the next five years and create
50 suchinstitutions by 2024.

Inthe past 5 years, anumber of our institutions have figured in the top 500 institutions of the world. We
will encourage academic institutions towards excellence and motivate more such institutions to rank
among the top 500 institutions of the world.

We will consciously promote a programme for ‘Study in India’, which will focus on bringing foreign
students to study in higher educational institutions in our country and make India a major destination
for education for foreign students.

To ensure innovation and quality research, we will incentivise the industry to collaborate with our
scientific labs and technological institutions, to undertake research in cutting-edge technology and
science.

We have launched the ‘National Digital Library of India’ and provided access to e-books and many
other papers to the students free-of-cost. To further promote a research-orientation in our higher
education institutions, we will take it forward by providing access to leading journals free of cost to the
students.

We will formulate a ‘National Policy for Reskilling and Upskilling’ to evolve a flexible and industry-
responsive workforce which is capable of accessing new opportunities and to insulate it from
technological shocks.

 

 

Women Empowerment

As, The Prime Minister has stated that ‘India needs not just women development, but women-led
development that makes women the leading force of our development trajectory’, and as per this
belief, we have determinedly gone beyond tokenism to take substantive measures to ensure overall
development of women and achieve gender equality. Building on these positive measures we will
continue to pursue the course of holistic development and increased participation of women in
society and economy.

Women-led Development

The gains made under our pioneering ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ programme have been impressive.
We are committed to continue to build on these gains to provide accessible and affordable quality
education to all women. We will ensure that ample financial support is available to girls through out
their education and subsidised education loans are provided for higher education.

During the last five years, we have focussed on ensuring a safe and dignified life and access to basic
resources for women through various schemes such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujjwala, Pradhan
Mantri Awas Yojana, Saubhagya. In the next 5 years, to ensure financial empowerment among women
in rural and semi-rural areas and create better employment opportunities for them, we will make every
effort to ensure access to credit and other resources, capacity building, market and distribution
network for women entrepreneurs, SHGs and women farmers.

We are committed to make women equal partners in and equal beneficiaries of the progress and
prosperity of the nation and will formulate a comprehensive ‘Women in Workforce’ roadmap focussed
on dramatically increasing the female workforce participation rate over the next five years. We will also
encourage industries and corporates to generate better employment opportunities for women.

To generate better work opportunities for women, 10% material to be sourced for government
procurement will be done from MSMEs having at least 50% women employees in their workforce.This
will cover various import substitution items including, but not limited to, apparel, leather, paper and
wood, articles, stone items like idols, etc, plastic and rubber items, furniture, clocks, toys etc.

To ensure greater participation of women in the workforce, it is necessary to enable them to continue
in the workforce by providing support for child care. Our government has already made it mandatory
for any establishment with 50 or more employees to have the facility of a creche. We will now
strengthen the creche programme with special focus on the needs of parents employed in the
unorganized sector to provide créche and child care facilities by leveraging the existing Anganwadis,
civil society organisations and the private sector. We will ensure that the number of childcare facilities
is increased three fold by 2022.

Ensuring Equal Rights

We have determinedly taken substantive measures to ensure overall development of women and
promote gender equality. Continuing our work, we will legislate a bill to prohibit and eliminate practices
suchas Triple Talag and Nikah Halala.

Ensuring a Dignified Life for Women

Continuing our efforts to ensure safe motherhood through schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Matru
Vandana Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Matritva Suraksha Abhiyaan and Ayushman Bharat, we will focus on
ensuring good quality, easily accessible and affordable maternal healthcare services for all women.

The government has launched a major initiative on malnutrition by launching the POSHAN Abhiyan.
We will reduce the malnutrition level by at least 10% in the next five years, doubling the rate of
reduction of malnourishment.

 

31

 

We will ensure that all reproductive and menstrual health services are easily available to all women
across India and with the expansion of ongoing Suvidha scheme, sanitary pads at an affordable cost of
just Rs. 1will be provided to all women and girls.

We have very significantly increased the honararium of ASHA and Anganwadi workers. We will
increase the coverage of Ayushman Bharat to include all Anganwadi workers and ASHA workers to
ensure improved health and social support system for these frontline workers.

Women's security will be given more priority. We have constituted the Women's Security Division in the
Home Ministry, and have made strict provisions for transferring the laws in order to prevent crimes
against women, in particular in a time-bound investigation and trial for rape. In such cases, forensic
facilities and fast track courts will be expanded to bring convicts to justice.

To create a positive atmosphere for women, promote gender justice and create awareness on issues
related to women, gender sensitisation courses will be made an essential part of all educational
institution's curriculum and training modules of public offices.

Inclusive Development

The creation of an open and egalitarian society is central to the philosophy of the BJP. ‘Sabka Saath,
Sabka Vikas’ is at the heart of PM Modi’s vision of New India.

Ensuring Justice for All

We are committed to ensure benefits of constitutional provisions of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
Tribes and backward classes. We will ensure that proper representation and opportunities are available
for these sections.

We have decisively ensured that the economically weaker sections (EWS) of the society who belong to
the non-reserved category are represented and have access to government jobs and higher
education through the 10% EWS reservation which was long overdue. We will implement the law in the
same spirit while ensuring that SCs, STs and OBCs continue to have their fair representation.

Strengthening ‘Sabka Vikas’

To ensure that quality education is available and easily accessible, every block with more than 50% ST
population and at least 20,000 tribal persons will have an Eklavya Model Residential School. Eklavya
Schools will be at par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and besides providing state of the art training in sports
and skill development, these schools will have special facilities for preserving local art and culture.

Continuing our efforts to promote social and political empowerment, we will ensure that the rights of
all forest dwellers are fully protected.

We will establish 50,000 ‘Van Dhan Vikas Kendras’ in the tribal areas of the country to ensure the
availability of primary processing and value addition for forest produce and to provide employment for
tribals and increase tribalincome.

We will make adequate provisions for personal safety equipment and accelerate the adoption of
mechanized cleaning to ensure occupational health and safety for Safai Karamcharis.

Ensuring welfare of Poor

We are committed to bringing down the percentage of families living below the poverty line toa single
digit in the next five years.

We will ensure pucca houses for families living in kuchha houses by 2022.

We have been successful in extending the food security cover to over 80 crore people from poor and
lower-middle-income families who are receiving food grains (wheat/rice/coarse grains) at highly
subsidized prices. We will further widen this cover to provide subsidized sugar (at Rs. 13 per kg per
family per month) to these families in line with our motto ‘Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas’.

The unprecedented success of the Jan Dhan Yojana has dramatically improved financial inclusion in
India. We will take further steps to ensure access to bank branches, payment banks and banking
correspondents by creating a new data-sharing framework that builds on the success of Jan Dhan and
Aadhaar platforms while ensuring data privacy and security. With this scheme, we will ensure that
every Indian has access to banking facilities within a radius of 5 km. We will also launch a technology-
enabled programme for broader financial literacy by complementing financial literacy with mass
media campaigns to provide information on financial products and their use to enable effective
participation of every Indian in the financial system.

Responsive to the Needs of Aspirational Middle Class

After providing major tax relief in the recent budget, we are committed to further revise the tax slabs
and the tax benefits to ensure more cash and greater purchasing power in the hands of our middle-
income families.

We will make all efforts to ensure that our aspirational middle class has access to education,
employment opportunities and suitable urban infrastructure for a better quality life.

Commitment to Geographical Equity

Inclusive development also means inclusion by geography. To this end, our Government has identified
115 aspirational districts that are being given special attention. We intend to continue with this effort to
ensure that these districts catch up with the rest of the country. Similarly, we have already laid the
foundation for economic and social progress of Eastern India through improved connectivity,
construction of high impact infrastructure projects and provision of adequate financial resources. We
intend to continue our efforts to resolve the geographical imbalance of the said region and ensure that
Eastern India is an equal participant in the progress and growth of the nation. In PM Modi’s words, this
is ‘Purvoday’ (Rise of the East).

Development with Dignity for the Minorities

We are committed to the empowerment and ‘development with dignity’ of all minorities (Muslims,
Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis etc ).

Caring for the Elderly

We will strengthen the Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana to ensure that poor senior citizens in need of aids and
assistive devices receive them ina timely manner.

Enabling Divyangs

To take forward the gains achieved under Sugamya Bharat, we will put in place a system of continuous
accessibility audits and ratings for cities, public infrastructure including airports, railway stations and
public transport systems, to ensure that they are fully accessible, with collaboration with industry and
civil society organisations.

We will prioritize Divyang beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and mandate accessibility
benchmarks to be met in Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.

Anganwadi and pre-school system will be strengthened to ensure that cases of disabilities are
detected at an early stage.

We will offer higher interest rates on fixed deposits by divyangs.

Political resolution on the matter of Gorkha

We will recognise the 11 left out Indian Gorkha sub-tribes as Schedule Tribes. We are also committed to
implement the reservation in the legislative assembly of Sikkim for Limboo and Tamang tribes.

@ We are committed to work towards finding a permanent political solution to the issue of Darjeeling

Hills, Siliguri Terai and Dooars region.

 

34

 

Ensuring welfare of the Labour Force

@ Under our government, there has been a 42% growth in the National Minimum Wage. We will maintain
the same direction over the next five years to ensure a respectable living for the workers.

Pension Scheme for all Small Shopkeepers

€ Wewillexpand the Pradhan MantriShram Yogi Maandhan scheme to cover all small shopkeepers.

Ensuring Welfare of Artisans

Q We will create an umbrella scheme ‘Pradhan Mantri Kalanidhi Yojana’ to allow flexible and customized
packages of credit, working capital and social security options to provide comprehensive support to
traditional arts.

Protecting Our Children

® We will formulate a comprehensive Child Protection Framework to facilitate the setting up of
standards and robust inspection and monitoring of child care institutions across India.

Empowering Transgenders

(3 We are committed to bring transgenders to the mainstream through adequate socio-economic and
policy initiatives.

We will ensure self-employment and skill development avenues for transgender youth.

etna Cee Heritage

Since inception, the philosophy of the BJP is anchored in the civilisational ethos of India. As we build
‘New India’, we intend to actively invest in strengthening our cultural roots and preserving civilisational
continuity. Far from seeing our cultural values as hurdles to progress, we see them as essential
ingredients of our future.

Ram Mandir

We reiterate our stand on Ram Mandir. We will explore all possibilities within the framework of the
Constitution and all necessary efforts to facilitate the expeditious construction of the Ram Temple in
Ayodhya.

Conserving Bharatiya Faith and Culture

We are committed to conserve and promote all culturally, religiously and spiritually significant heritage
sites related to every faith in India and the ongoing PRASAD scheme will be expanded to achieve this
goal.

Conserving Bharatiya Linguistic Culture

We will constitute a National Task Force to study the status of all written and spoken languages and
dialects in India. We will also work towards revival and promotion of vulnerable or extinct dialects and
languages.

With a focussed effort on promotion of Sanskrit, we will ensure that the teaching of Sanskrit is
expanded and popularised at the school level. We will also provide 100 Panini fellowships to
researchers and scholars across India to promote research in Sanskrit.

Namami Gange: A matter of Pride

We are committed to ensure a clean and uninterrupted flow of river Ganga from Gangotri to Ganga
Sagar. We will ensure that the sewerage infrastructure to deal with 100% of the waste water from the
Ganga towns is completed and is functioning effectively, and take steps to enhance the river flow.

The villages located on the banks of the river, which are already open defecation free, will be taken up
under a special project to ensure complete sustainable management of solid and liquid waste.

Sabarimala

We will undertake every effort to ensure that the subject of faith, tradition and worship rituals related
to Sabarimala are presented in a comprehensive manner before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. We will
endeavour to secure constitutional protection on issues related to faith and belief.

Promoting Yoga Globally

We will further continue our efforts to promote Yoga globally as the world celebrates 21st June as the
International Yoga Day. We will promote Yoga as a vital method to achieve physical wellness and
spiritual rejuvenation across the globe and will continue to work towards training of Yoga practitioners.
We will undertake a rapid expansion of Yoga health hubs, Yoga tourism and research in Yoga.

Bharatiya Cultural Festival

An International Cultural Festival will be organised on a grand scale every year in 5 different states to
showcase and promote the rich diversity of Indian culture and efforts will be made for greater
participation of Pravasi Bharatiya population and international community.

36

  

To increase accessibility and promote all culturally and historically significant heritage sites and
museums in India, we will launch a web-enabled virtual tour of all such locations through ‘Dharohar
Dharshan-an integrated web portal’. Eliminating the geographical boundaries, the portal will provide
real-time experience of Indian cultural heritage, accessible from any corner of the globe.

Article 44 of the Constitution of India lists Uniform Civil Code as one of the Directive Principles of State
Policy. BUP believes that there cannot be gender equality till such time India adopts a Uniform Civil
Code, which protects the rights of all women, and the BJP reiterates its stand to draft a Uniform Civil
Code, drawing upon the best traditions and harmonizing them with the modern times.

 

 

crulaoie am Policy

We believe that India’s time has come. She is emerging as a power and connecting stakeholders in a
multi-polar world. The rise of India is the new reality and we shall play a major role in shaping global
agendain the 21st century.

‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’

While pursuing our national developmental and security interests, the ancient Indian vision of
‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ will form the basis in our global co-operation for progress, prosperity,
peace and security, especially with friendly countries and neighbours. Besides working to secure and
safeguard ‘global commons’, we will strengthen our role as ‘first responder’ for disaster relief and
humanitarian assistance and develop partnerships for disaster resilient infrastructure.

Global Coordination on Knowledge and Technology

We will make knowledge exchange and transfer of technology for the development of all countries a
major focus of our diplomatic relations. As a part of this, we will endeavour to create an ‘International
Space Technology Alliance’ for better coordination and cooperation on issues related to space
technology to ensure that the benefits of space technology reach all, especially the smaller countries.

Continuous Dialogue with Indians Living Abroad

We will create an institutional mechanism to deepen the relationship of culture and heritage with
people of Indian origin, and to regularly engage with them. We will simultaneously launch ‘Bharat
Gaurav’ campaign to increase interaction among the Indian diaspora and enable their continuous
engagement with the Indian missions. We will strengthen the MADAD portal as single-point avenue for
information and services for Indians living abroad.

Combating Terrorism through Global Forums

We are committed to taking concrete steps on international forums against countries and
organizations supporting terrorism, and we will take all necessary measures to isolate such countries
and organizations on the global stage. To ensure the same, we will work towards establishing a ‘Comity
of Nations Against International Terrorism’ as a voluntary multi-lateral forum based on the principles of
the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.

Deeper Multilateral Co-operation

We will effectively pursue co-operation against global evils, such as terrorism and corruption through
forums like UN, the G20, BRICS, SCO, Commonwealth, etc. Significant interactions such as Russia-
India-China (RIC) and Japan-America-India (JAI) will be strengthened. To forward our
‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, we will extensively leverage forums such as BIMSTEC, to accelerate
regional coordination and economic co-operation with countries in our neighbourhood. Act East
Policy, cooperation with ASEAN and ensuring an open, inclusive, prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific
willbe pursued vigorously.

Permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council

We are committed to seeking permanent membership of the United Nation Security Council so that
the body reflects the contemporary geopolitical realities of the world. We are determined to intensify
our efforts towards these objectives.

 

38

 

Strengthening the Diplomatic Cadre and Outreach

We will increase the strength of the diplomatic and allied cadres to keep pace with our increasing
global engagement and enhanced stature of India in the world. In addition, we will facilitate the
participation of experts in foreign policy-making through a robust mechanism. We will establish a full-
fledged University of Foreign Policy, the first of its kind in the region, to focus on academic study and
research on foreign policy and geopolitical issues relevant to India and capacity building of our and
friendly foreign diplomats. India’s states will be actively assisted in their international outreach for
economic development.

Introduction

Dear Countrymen,

Elections to the 14th Lok Sabha will take place in April-May 2004.
The Bharatiya Janata Party along with its partners in the National
Democratic Alliance, has entered the electoral fray seeking a renewed
mandate under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Atal
Bihari Vajpayee. On this occasion, I am pleased to present before
you the Vision Document 2004, which sets forth our Party’s core
beliefs, basic commitments, and our priority agenda for the next
five years and beyond.

India is an ancient civilisation with a rich cultural and spiritual
heritage. We have perennial rivers, fertile land, hardworking kisans,
industrious workers, skilled artisans, great intellectuals, a robust
scientific and technological establishment and capable entrepreneurs.
Why, then, did India lag behind in development? The answer lay
in the Congress party’s wrong policies and long misrule.

The Congress era in Indian politics is over. The era of the BJP
has begun. India has now embarked on a path of rapid progress
and all-round development. India is more ambitious, more self-
confident and more capable now than ever before.

For the BJP our vision, our political journey and our distinctive
identity have always been personified by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Since the inception of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, and the founding
of the BJP, Shri Atalji has been our leader, guiding the Party
throughout its steady march forward in the past five decades,
inspiring countless Indians with his poetry, his thoughts, his tapasya
and his towering personality. Because Shri Atalji best personifies
our Party’s vision, we have decided to illustrate this document

with pictures showing different facets of his political life.

I do hope that this Vision Document succeeds in persuading
you to give an absolute majority to the BJP and a two-thirds majority
to the NDA in the 14th Lok Sabha.

Vande Mataram!

President
Bharatiya Janata Party

Introduction

2.1 India on the Move

The people of India will elect the 14th Lok Sabha in the elections
to be held in April-May 2004. The Bharatiya Janata Party, as the
leading constituent of the National Democratic Alliance, enters
this electoral battle seeking a renewed and bigger mandate for the
NDA, with a significantly larger representation for itself, in the
next Lok Sabha. We do so on the basis of our Performance, Vision
and Leadership, the proud performance of our Government; our
clear vision and programme for making India a strong, secure, and
integrally Developed Nation by 2020; and the inspiring leadership
of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee which is the continuing link between
our performance so far and our pledge for the future.

In 1999, the people voted for the National Democratic Alliance.
The Bharatiya Janata Party was the largest constituent of the NDA
and the single largest party in the Lok Sabha. Our promise to the
people then was encapsulated in the assurance: “ Able Leadership,
Stable Government”. On both counts, we have more than fulfilled
our promise.

The Vajpayee Government's achievements in strengthening
national security, countering cross-border terrorism, fortifying
national unity, setting India on the path of high socio-economic
growth, making development the national mantra, and raising
India’s image and standing in the international community have
created a surge of hope and national pride.

The Pokharan-II blasts in May 1998 triggered a process of
national resurgence. India successfully beat back post-Pokharan
sanctions imposed by big powers. The same countries are now
keen on strengthening comprehensive relations with India. There

has been a significant reduction in cross-border terrorism. India
has also played a widely acclaimed role in creating international
awareness and solidarity on the issue of jehadi terrorism.

India’s economic fundamentals are robust and its strengths
envied. Today ours is one of the fastest growing economies in the
world; India’s GDP growth rate is estimated to be over 8 per cent
this year. Our Government has heralded a Connectivity Revolution
in India. Some of the largest and most ambitious projects are now
underway for improving India’s infrastructure with highway
connectivity, rural roads connectivity, telecom and Internet
connectivity, railway connectivity, port and airport connectivity.
The past five years have seen the largest ever number of BPL
families rising above the poverty line over a comparable period
in independent India’s history.

Major steps have been taken for addressing the long-neglected
needs of agriculture. Agricultural credit has been nearly trebled
and over 3.5 crore farmers have been given Kisan Credit Cards.
Interest rates have been significantly lowered. Minimum Support
Prices for over 25 crops have been raised every year. An innovative
Farm Income Insurance Scheme has been introduced.

In a short time, India has emerged as a leading power in
Information Technology. Ina short time, our manufacturing sector
has restructured itself and become globally competitive. Individual
Indians have always scripted success stories in India and overseas;
now India as a whole is big news. Today, India stands tall in the
international community. Its voice is heard and respected. Our
people are finding fresh recognition and new audiences.

There is a rapidly widening belief, both in our own country
and all over the world, that India is poised for a great leap forward.

Ours is an ancient nation with a civilisation that is more than
5,000 years old. We have inherited a glorious cultural heritage,
which the entire world marvels at. India has time and again shown
unmatched resilience to overcome the vicissitudes of history, to
emerge resurgent. The time of Indian Renaissance has arrived
again. We have set the stage to reclaim our rightful inheritance
as a Great Power contributing to humanity’s all-round progress.

2.2 The Congress era in Indian politics is over

The BJP holds the Congress Party, which ruled India for the
longest period since Independence, principally guilty for the many

Untitled-10 9 11/7/2016 11:18:58 PM

10 * Party Document Vol-1

problems that our Government inherited. Half a century is not too
short a time for a country to be liberated from the curse of poverty
and backwardness. India did make considerable progress during
this period. But this progress fell woefully short of her potential
as well as her needs.

This wide gap between promise and performance was the
result of the wrong policies of successive Congress governments.
They promoted corruption, weakened institutions of the State and
failed to mobilise people’s participation in the development process.
The Congress Party weakened the bonds of national unity and social
harmony for partisan gains. Allowing itself to be reduced froma great
party of the Freedom Movement to a tool in the hands of a family, it
sought to reduce the world’s largest democracy to dynastic rule.

The Congress era in Indian politics is now over. And the BJP’s
era - the era of nationalist, democratic and development-oriented
politics - has begun.

India is today a nation once again on the move. We have
recovered our bearings. After five decades of wasted opportunities,
the Vajpayee Government has infused new life and vigour into the
soul of India. From being a nation of unrealised potential, its policies
and performance have helped unleash India’s positive energies.

2.3 Atalji’s Leadership: A Source of Immense Pride

The BJP is proud that it has given India and the world a
leader of the calibre of Shri Vajpayee. As Prime Minister, he has
harnessed the national energy and transformed the national mood.
With his fierce integrity, long tapasya, commitment to the ideals
of democracy, indomitable patriotism and statesmanship, he has
shown that he is an embodiment of India’s best political traditions.

Shri Vajpayee has demolished the Congress Party’s self-serving
myth that it alone, and a member of the Nehru family alone, can rule
India. He has effected a mindset change in the country. In polity, his
leadership has demonstrated that coalition governance can be stable
and successful. In society, his personality has promoted the values
of tolerance, understanding and partnership. In our neighbourhood
and in the world, his statesmanship has championed the cause of
peace and dispute resolution through dialogue, while resolutely
guarding our national interest.

Election Manifestoes * 11

Under Shri Vajpayee’s leadership, an atmosphere of distrust
and disharmony has been replaced by a spirit of cooperation and
consensus. The highhandedness and partisanship that marked
the Centre’s relations with the States have given way to a healthy
Union. With a good blend of national outlook and legitimate regional
aspirations, the NDA Government has brought the diverse sections
of our society closer together.

The Prime Minister has shown unprecedented earnestness
to resolve outstanding and inherited problems. Thus, Jammu &
Kashmir is returning to peace, normalcy and development after
what seemed to be an unending era of strife, terror and separatist
activities fomented from across the border. The fulfilment of his
promise to hold free and fair elections in the State in 2002 was a
major milestone in this process.

Peace talks in the North-East are also making headway. No
Central Government in the past paid as much attention to the
developmental needs of this important region as the Vajpayee
Government has. For the first time since Independence, a separate
ministry has been established for this purpose.

The BJP considers the Joint Statement issued during the Prime
Minister’s January visit to Islamabad a historic foreign policy
success for India. For the first time, through this joint statement,
Pakistan has committed itself to preventing the use of any part of
the territory under its control for terrorist activities aimed against
India.

If Shri Vajpayee won the hearts of Indians and the admiration
of the international community with his firm leadership during the
Kargil War, he is repeating the feat now with his earnest pursuit
of peace-through-dialogue with Pakistan. The whole world today
recognizes him as a “Man of Peace”.

Shri Vajpayee has boldly demolished the culture of cynicism
and negativism that impaired the national character. He has
inspired India to think big, implement big, and believe in itself.
He has motivated the youth to nurture big dreams and to work
hard to realize them. He is indeed “The Great Unifier”, binding
India’s aspirations, energies and diversities. Oo

The Context of Election 2004

For the people of India the 2004 general election is an opportunity
to reaffirm faith in the leadership of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee and
in the policies of the NDA Government. These have yielded initial
results and, taken forward, will definitely produce big gains for
India and all Indians.

The 2004 general election is also an opportunity for all Indians
to reject the grim, feel-pain record of the Congress Party and endorse
the feel-good mood generated by the our Government.

Every election has a specific context. According to the BJP,
the two main issues of Election 2004 are: good governance and
accelerated, all-round development. There is a new type of hunger
in India —the tremendous hunger for development. It is especially
acute in rural areas and among the urban poor. They want to free
themselves from poverty, backwardness and underdevelopment.
They want to see an end to regional and social imbalances in
development. They want the rural-urban divide to be bridged.
They want the best opportunities for themselves and their children.
They want a standard of living that is fulfilling. They want dignity.
They want security and prosperity.

India is now impatient to get to the top. India wants to be the
best. One billion Indians want to show to themselves, and to the
world, what they can do.

India has had enough of negativism. The BJP is committed
to making India a Developed Nation and a Great Power on the
global stage.

We have the leadership, we have the commitment and we
have the vision to make India shine ever brighter.

In 2004, we seek a decisive mandate for India. Oo

Our Basic Mission and Commitments

4.1 Politics as a means to serve the Nation:

From modest beginnings, the BJP has grown steadily to emerge
as a stable pole of Indian politics. Our growth is rooted in our
distinctive ideology and the tireless dedication of millions of our
karyakartas throughout the country. In Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
ably assisted by Shri Lal Krishna Advani, we have a leadership that
has guided and inspired our Party for decades. For the BJP and
the fraternal organisations that constitute our extended Nationalist
Parivar, politics and power have never been ends in themselves, but
a means to serve the people and to contribute to India’s attainment
of Param Vaibhav (peaks of glory).

4.2 Strengthening India’s Democracy:

The BJP is deeply committed to strengthening India’s
democracy and to making its institutions more effective in fulfilling
the aspirations of our people. We are proud that our Party has
nurtured the best traditions of internal democracy in India’s
political class. In the years to come, we shall continue to broaden
the interaction between the Party organization and the people,
between the people and their elected representatives, and between
the Party and the Government to make governance more dynamic,
more responsive and more responsible.

4.3 Integral Humanism:

The BJP is proud of its commitment to the philosophy of
Integral Humanism, as enunciated by Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya.
We believe that development cannot be measured by economic
indicators alone. Development must be holistic. It must fulfil the

Untitled-10 13 11/7/2016 11:18:59 PM

14 * Party Document Vol-1

material and non-material needs of all individuals and promote a
symbiotic relationship between the individual and society, in which
the individual works for society, and society, in turn, cares for the
individual. Development must also keep in mind environmental
concerns, local and community traditions, and the quality of life.

The BJP believes that economic progress should not be at
the cost of family values. The family constitutes the social unit of
stability, welfare, and continuity of cultural traditions. Its importance
can never be undermined. Integral Humanism teaches us that our
nation too is a family and that India itself is a part of the larger
human family.

4.4 Cultural Nationalism:

The BJP draws its inspiration from the history and civilisation
of India. We believe that Indian nationhood stems from a deep
cultural bonding of the people that overrides differences of caste,
region, religion and language. We believe that Cultural Nationalism
for which Indianness, Bharatiyata and Hindutva are synonyms - is
the basis of our national identity.

Contrary to what its detractors say, and as the Supreme Court
itself has decreed, Hindutva is not a religious or exclusivist concept.
It is inclusive, integrative, and abhors any kind of discrimination
against any section of the people of India on the basis of their faith.
It rejects the idea of a theocratic or denominational state. It accepts
the multi-faith character and other diversities of India, considering
them to be a source of strength and not weakness. It firmly upholds
secularism, understood as Sarva Pantha Samabhav (treating all
faiths with respect).

However, the BJP unflinchingly holds that differences in faith
cannot challenge the idea of India as One Nation or undermine
our millennia-old identity as One People. This is why, we rejected
the two-nation theory on the basis of which our Motherland was
tragically partitioned in 1947. Thus, Cultural Nationalism is the
most potent antidote to communalism, divisiveness, and separatism
of every kind, and a guarantor of our national unity and national
integration.

4.5 Ram Mandir in Ayodhya:

The BJP reaffirms its commitment to the construction of a
Ram temple in Ayodhya. As Maryada Purushottam, Ram is an
inspiring cultural symbol of India. His birthplace in Ayodhya is

Untitled-10 14 11/7/2016 11:18:59 PM

Election Manifestoes * 15

also associated with the religious sentiments of crores of Hindus.
The BJP remains committed to its stand that the judiciary’s verdict
in this matter should be accepted by all. However, we believe that
dialogue, and a negotiated settlement in an atmosphere of mutual
trust and goodwill, are the best way of achieving this goal. The
BJP appeals to the religious and social leaders of the Hindu and
Muslim communities to speed up the process of dialogue and bring
it to an amicable and early fruition. We hope that these efforts will
succeed in heralding a new chapter of amity in Hindu-Muslim
relations and fortify national integration.

4.6 Religious Freedom, our Core Value:

Contrary to the propaganda of the Congress and our
other political opponents, Shri Vajpayee’s government has not
discriminated against minorities, nor curtailed their religious
freedoms in any manner. In statecraft, we will continue to be wedded
to our founding ideal of “Justice for All, Appeasement of None”.
We envision the day when the distinction between “majority” and
“minority” disappears in the political field, even while people
practise their respective faiths unhindered.

The BJP gives a three-point assurance to minorities: Education,
Economic upliftment, and Empowerment. At the same time, we
appeal to them to change their old mindset vis-a-vis the BJP and
strengthen the hands of Shri Vajpayee in the coming elections.

4.7 Consensus over Uniform Civil Code:

The BJP believes that all laws, including personal laws, must
be in accordance with the guarantees available to all citizens under
the Indian Constitution. The Constitution calls for the enactment
of a Uniform Civil Code. The Supreme Court has reiterated this
need. Therefore, this cannot be seen as an issue of any single
political party. The BJP views Uniform Civil Code primarily as an
instrument to promote gender justice. We believe that social and
political consensus has to be evolved before its enactment.

4.8 Swadeshi:

The BJP believes that every civilisation has its own innate
genius. We are committed to Swadeshi, the philosophy of India
First, and to the path of self-reliance. Swadeshi means faith in

Untitled-10 15 11/7/2016 11:18:59 PM

16 * Party Document Vol-1

indigenous institutions and a strong belief that the future of India
must be secured by Indians themselves.

The BJP believes that India’s goal of achieving a double-digit
annual GDP growth rate on a sustainable basis can be achieved
principally by mobilizing our own domestic resources. A strong,
efficient and high-growth Indian economy, in which Indian
products, services and entrepreneurs dominate the domestic and
global markets, is our concept of Swadeshi. This can be achieved
by making Indian products and services competitive on both cost
and quality.

4.9 Globalisation:

The BJP believes that, to reduce the risks and challenges
of globalisation and to enhance its opportunities and gains, it is
imperative to bridge the current divide between the developing
and developed economies. This divide is enabling the developed
nations to secure unfair advantages for themselves in global trade,
investments, agriculture and services. They give huge trade-
distorting agricultural subsidies to their own farmers, but object
to the legitimate pro-farmer measures by developing countries.
The NDA Government has been at the forefront of defending the
interests of Indian kisans by bringing about a coalition of developing
countries against such unjust practices of developed countries. We
did so successfully at the WTO meets in Doha and Cancun. Our
Government has also successfully defended India’s case in other
matters such as patents. This approach shall continue.

The BJP is of the view that a big shift is taking place in the
global economy, and India should be prepared to take advantage of
it. This shift favours low-cost economies over high-cost economies
in manufacturing and services, provided the former have sufficient
competitive strengths on the counts of cost, quality and technology.
The Indian economy is rapidly acquiring these strengths. The BJP
is committed to accelerating this process by further reforming
our economy, modernizing our infrastructure, enriching India’s
human resources, and augmenting our capabilities in science and
technology. This will place our predominantly young population
in an advantageous position vis-a-vis many advanced nations in
the world that are projected to have a demographic disadvantage

Untitled-10 16 11/7/2016 11:18:59 PM

Election Manifestoes * 17

in the coming decades. This is the Swadeshi approach to turning
globalisation into an opportunity for India in the 21st century.

4.10 Underpinnings of Our Economic Vision:

The BJP believes that India must greatly enhance her economic
strength, in order to enhance her national strength and become a
Great Power. Towards this strategic goal, the BJP is committed to
ensuring faster economic growth with equity, employment, and
social justice.

The underpinnings of our economic vision are: steady
enhancement of the productivity of our human and natural resources
with the best use of science, technology, management and HRD
practices, both modern and traditional; removal of regional and
social imbalances; bridging the urban-rural divide; minimizing
the gap between the rich and poor; maximizing developmental
opportunities for all citizens; and environmental protection.

The BJP believes that, as India moves from being a developing
country to a developed one, our economic policy has to have a
two-pronged approach: policies to achieve faster economic growth
combined with effective welfare measures for the poor. Today the
foremost national developmental objective is banishment of poverty
by increasing our national wealth. The surest way to achieve this goal,
as Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya had emphasized four decades ago,
is: “Work for Every Hand and Water to Every Land”. Agriculture
continues to be the backbone of India’s rural economy, sustaining
the livelihood of a majority of our population. Government policies
must, therefore, be geared to encourage domestic savings and
directing them into productive, entrepreneurship-promoting and
employment-generating investments, especially in agriculture and
other areas of the rural economy.

The BJP believes that wealth creation should be applauded and
encouraged. However, conspicuous consumption goes against the
cultural ethos of India. We are not in favour of selfish advancement of
the few. Rather, the BJP believes in the multiplication of universally
accessible entitlements for the majority.

The BJP is committed to greater consumer choice. We believe
that the creation of monopolies, both in the public and private
sector, are undesirable, except when dictated by national security.

Untitled-10 17 11/7/2016 11:18:59 PM

18 * Party Document Vol-1

We believe in a responsible fiscal regime marked by modest deficits,
low inflation and a steadily strengthening rupee.

4.11 India’s Cultural and Spiritual Heritage:

The BJP considers India’s priceless cultural and spiritual
heritage to be our intangible national wealth. It has protected our
family system, sustained our national life over the millennia and
given India her unique identity in the world. We are proud that
all the world’s religions have their footprint in India. We believe
that a proper use of our cultural and spiritual resources can greatly
aid India’s developmental endeavours because of their enormous
power to mobilize people’s energies. This cultural and spiritual
heritage displays immense diversities, which should be cherished
and celebrated by all Indians as our common endowment.

We consider it to be the bounden duty of the Government
and citizens alike to preserve and further augment this wealth
of a diverse heritage. In this context, the BJP applauds the NDA
Government’s decision to launch national missions for the
preservation of manuscripts, monuments, and other facets of our
cultural, artistic and spiritual heritage. However, a lot more needs
to be done, considering the neglect of this crucial aspect of nation-
building in the past.

Our Priority Agenda for the
Next Five Years

(The B]P has suggested specific measures under the following areas for
inclusion in the NDA’s Manifesto for Election 2004.)

5.1 Defence

The BJP has always attached the highest importance to national
security. We are proud of the NDA Government's historic initiatives
to strengthen India’s defence capability and preparedness. We
commit ourselves to carrying forward the work done in the past
five years. Our priorities will be: speedy implementation of all the
ongoing programmes for modernisation, acquisition and capability
enhancement; minimizing delays and procedural bottlenecks, which
push up costs and cause obsolescence; achieving greater efficiency in
defence spending; giving a further boost to indigenisation of defence
production and encouragement to private sector participation; and
making defence exports a thrust area.

The BJP would also work for further augmentation of welfare
measures for ex-servicemen and war widows, creating adequate
opportunities for retired officers to contribute to development
activities where they can put their skills and training to productive
use; and making service in the Armed Forces an attractive career
option for the educated Indian youth.

5.2 Internal Security

The BJP believes that creating a society free of fear, and
ensuring safety and security to all citizens form the cornerstone
of good governance. Our war on terrorism, which has shown

Untitled-10 19 11/7/2016 11:19:00 PM

20 * Party Document Vol-1

encouraging results in the past five years, will continue with
unflagging determination. Building on the significant reduction
of communal and caste violence in the past five years, we shall
work with redoubled zeal to realise our vision of a riot-free India.

The long misrule of the Congress Party weakened India’s
internal security apparatus and reduced its capacity to counter
jehadi terrorism, left-wing extremism, organised crime, and,
in some States, even to maintain law and order. For the first
time since Independence, the NDA Government conducted a
comprehensive review of the internal security scenario, started to
act on its recommendations and launched a massive programme to
modernise our police and paramilitary forces. The BJP is concerned
at the inadequate utilization of the police modernization fund in
several States, even though the need for it is glaring. We will work
with State Governments for time-bound implementation of this
programme with utmost urgency.

We will continue our efforts to build political consensus to
enact a Central law, and constitute a federal agency to deal with
federal crimes like the Telgi scam, which encompass several States.
We will also work with the States to urgently implement police
reforms that would make the police and security forces more
people-friendly, more sensitive towards the grievances of the poor,
weaker sections of society, and women.

The BJP recognises the growing menace of left-wing extremism,
which extends from the Nepal border to Andhra Pradesh, as one of
the most serious challenges to India’s internal security. Overcoming
this menace, with the closest possible cooperation among the
affected States and the Centre, will be our priority. Since the fight
against Naxalite outfits can be successfully waged primarily by
isolating them from local populations, our Government will take
further steps to speed up development activities, encourage people’s
participation in them, and ensure that their benefits actually reach
the poor.

5.3 Jammu & Kashmir

The unity of India is not only sacred to the BJP, but also a
paramount commitment. We have always believed that Jammu
& Kashmir, including the PoK, is an integral part of India. We

Untitled-10 20 11/7/2016 11:19:00 PM

Election Manifestoes * 21

hold that the age of redrawing national boundaries is over. While
recognizing that the Constitution provides for certain transient and
temporary provisions for Jammu & Kashmir, we believe that the
immediate challenge before the Centre and the State is to involve all
sections of society in eliminating terrorism, accelerating economic
development and strengthening popular governance that can
provide people-friendly administration. The imperative for security
operations has to be balanced with respect for human rights. We
are committed to ensuring early return of Kashmiri Pandits and
other displaced people to their native places.

We believe in balanced development of all the three regions
of the State—Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh—without any
discrimination against any section of the State’s population. To
ensure this, the BJP is committed to a three-point programme:

(a) Autonomous Regional Councils for Jammu and Ladakh

with adequate financial and administrative powers;

(b) Protection of the original demographic identity of the

three regions.

(c) Equitable distribution of funds from the Centre.

The BJP strongly condemns the recent move by the Government
of J&K to introduce a law that discriminates against women
marrying outside the State in matters of inheritance rights. We will
do everything democratically possible to stop such anti-women
moves.

5.4 North-East

The NDA Government has given unprecedented attention to
the development of the North-Eastern States. Consolidating the
gains already made, we are committed to achieving:

(a) Restoration of peace and normalcy in all the disturbed
regions by dialogue with all groups who are willing to
give up the path of violence, and by firmly dealing with
those who continue on this path.

(b) Ensuring that the ethnic identities of all the people in the
North-East are protected.

(c) Putting an end to infiltration from Bangladesh and
vigorously pursuing the 3-D formula — Detect, Delete, and
Deport.

Untitled-10 21 11/7/2016 11:19:00 PM

22 * Party Document Vol-1

(d) Accelerating economic development that provides growth
opportunities to all.
(e) Development of the communication infrastructure to
overcome the constraints of physical distance.
(f) Making all Indians more aware of the rich history and
cultural heritage of our North-Eastern States, including
Sikkim.
(g) Expanding regional economic cooperation with countries
in our eastern neighbourhood and in South East Asia.
The BJP is also committed to imparting further momentum
to the activities of the Island Development Authority to attend to
the needs of the people of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshdweep
Islands.

5.5 Poverty Alleviation

The BJP stands committed to tackling dire poverty on a war
footing. The persistence of abject poverty after more than 50 years
of Independence is a result of both misrule and the faulty policies
followed by the Congress. In the past six years, the number of
Indians living below the poverty line has diminished significantly.
However, an unacceptably large number of our citizens are so
steeped in poverty that they are unable to reap the full benefits of
India’s march forward, or to contribute their fullest to it.

We shall wipe out the problems of poverty and backwardness
by mounting a five-pronged attack:

5.5.1 By policies aimed at fully harnessing India’s productive
potential and creating national wealth;

5.5.2 By policies that ensure distributive justice by expanding
the basket of opportunities for all;

5.5.3 By policies that direct greater governmental investment
and incentivise more private investment in backward and
rural areas;

5.5.4 By policies and programmes that bring vibrancy to the
rural economy, expand and deepen rural markets, and
thus create large-scale employment and self-employment
opportunities locally.

5.5.5 By continuing and further strengthening Antyodaya
schemes targeted at BPL families and social security
schemes aimed at the unorganized sector.

Untitled-10 22 11/7/2016 11:19:00 PM

Election Manifestoes * 23

5.5.6 By effecting time-bound distribution of surplus land and
making the rural poor partners in the development of
wasteland;

5.5.7 By giving inalienable ownership rights to tribals who have
been traditionally living on forest lands.

5.6 Second Green Revolution

The route to agricultural prosperity and rural regeneration
lies in scientific management of water, land and bio resources,
and better linkages with both domestic and export markets. Our
vision has three objectives: (a) Indian agriculture should meet the
growing domestic demand; (b) it should emerge as an important
global player; and (c) agriculture should become remunerative
even to small farmers with shrinking landholdings.

The first Green Revolution enabled India to achieve self-
sufficiency in food. However, it did not address many critical
problems in agriculture and food economy. The BJP believes
that a Second Green Revolution is needed to increase farm
productivity, achieve crop diversification, reduce waste and
add value at every stage in the food chain linking the kisan
to the consumer. Towards this end, we will continue to give a
boost to dairy, poultry and other food-processing industries.
We will promote horticulture, floriculture, sericulture, and
cultivation of bio-fuels, medicinal plants and bamboo in a big
way. We will take up crop insurance scheme and the newly
launched farm income insurance scheme for effective and large-
scale implementation. Comprehensive reform of agricultural
markets; free movement of agricultural goods throughout the
country; setting up of cold storages, godowns and grain banks;
intensification of technology transfer and agricultural extension
services; and support to organic farming will be given priority in
the Second Green Revolution.

Agricultural workers, many of whom are marginal farmers
themselves, form a large section of the rural poor. The BJP is
committed to lifting them above BPL levels, ensuring sustainable
year-long employment with minimum wages, enhancing their
labour productivity, expanding the social security net for them,
and improving their overall quality of life.

Untitled-10 23 11/7/2016 11:19:00 PM

24 * Party Document Vol-1

The BJP is fully committed to preserving India’s animal
wealth especially, to protection of Gau Mata (Cow) and her
progeny. We shall evolve a consensus to bring a Central
legislation in this regard.

5.7 Support to Cottage Industries

Revitalization of India’s cottage industries, arts and handicrafts
forms the pivot of the BJP’s vision of faster economic growth
with equity and employment. Towards this end, we will intensify
our efforts to ensure that the banking sector and government
departments are receptive to their special needs. We will improve
linkages with domestic and export markets for their products.
Activities of the Khadi & Village Industries Commission (KVIC)
and its affiliate bodies, which have done remarkable work in the
past five years, will be given greater support.

5.8 Making India a Global Manufacturing Hub

The BJP believes that India can become the manufacturing
hub for the world. India’s capability to achieve this goal is evident
from the highly encouraging initial successes in pharmaceuticals,
automobiles, auto-components, engineering goods and some
other products. We aim to provide the conditions for a broad
manufacturing base that can export its products all over the
world, and can compete not only on cost but also on quality and
technology. In the process, we aim to actively facilitate the creation
of global Indian brands and Indian MNCs. Our small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), the KVIC sector, and traditional industries such
as textiles, gems and jewellery and leather, have a huge potential
to contribute to this endeavour. This potential will be unleashed
through suitable policy and institutional measures. We will take
necessary steps to realize similar growth potential in our food-
processing, telecom and IT hardware, and other industries.

A competitive manufacturing sector requires the simultaneous
fulfillment of various conditions. They include a network of good
roads and railways, efficient ports and airports, low-cost and
reliable power, cutting-edge communication and IT infrastructure,
strengthening of India’s core sector oil and natural gas, steel, coal,
minerals, metals —, quality educational institutions that provide a

Untitled-10 24 11/7/2016 11:19:01 PM

Election Manifestoes * 25

skilled workforce, a sophisticated financial sector which can meet
low-cost capital needs of businesses, modern trading environment,
and, above all, maximum government facilitation with minimum
government interference. Specifically, firm and quick steps will
be taken to put an end to the tyranny of the Red Tape and the
Inspector Raj, which breeds corruption, drains the growth potential
and demotivates Indian entrepreneurs.

We are proud that India has successfully embarked on this
growth-oriented path. Unlike during the Congress years, the “Made
in India” brand is making waves in global markets. We envision
a future when it will dominate world markets in a wide range of
products, creating large-scale prosperity and employment at home.
The BJP will actively work for the realization of this vision.

5.9 Putting India at the Centre of the Knowledge Economy

The BJP is proud of the spectacular achievements of India’s
software professionals and entrepreneurs both at home and abroad.
They have not only given India a new stream of wealth-creation and
employment generation, but also brightened our country’s image
globally. The BJP believes that this is just the beginning, and the
best of India in the emerging Knowledge Economy is yet to come.

To achieve this, we have to consolidate India’s leadership in
software exports and strengthen our IT hardware industry. We
also have to expand our share in employment-intensive IT-enabled
services across the value spectrum through enterprises like call
centers and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) centres. The BJP
sees India emerging as a preferred service provider to the world in an
ever-widening range of services, including high-paying professional
services of teachers, doctors, lawyers, managers, accountants, and
scientists. We will fully support our bio-technology sector, which
is making rapid strides. India has acquired impressive self-reliant
strengths in space research, peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and
civilian applications of defence research. These strengths will be
further augmented and commercialised appropriately. We will
also strive to develop Indian businesses in other frontier areas
of technology, such as micro-electronics, nano-technology, new
materials, etc.

To achieve these ends, we have to make India a front-ranking

Untitled-10 25 11/7/2016 11:19:01 PM

26 * Party Document Vol-1

nation in scientific and technological R&D. Partnership between
Indian businesses and CSIR, DRDO, ICAR, ICMR, ISRO, BARC,
IITs, universities and other government-supported research
institutions will be vastly expanded. We will actively encourage
more foreign companies to set up their R&D centers in India or
start joint R&D activities with Indian entities. Our NRI and PIO
professionals and entrepreneurs would be encouraged to participate
in this partnership.

5.10 Our Vision for an Ideal Indian Village

Majority of India’s population continues to live in villages.
However, the neglect of the development needs of villages is one of
the particularly damning parts of the legacy left behind by the long
Congress misrule. This is clear from two stark facts: even after five
decades of Independence, as many as 1.86 lakh villages one-third
of all villages in the country were deprived of good roads; and as
many as 60% of our rural households have no toilets.

In line with what Mahatma Gandhi had said, the BJP believes
that India cannot rise to her full potential without the revitalization
of rural India. Our vision of an ideal Indian village is one that
has the following attributes: (a) self-reliant society and dynamic
economy that makes best use of local human and natural resources
and has linkages to the national and global economy; (b) modern
infrastructure and basic amenities — bijlee, sadak, paani, education,
quality healthcare at the nearest place, and sanitation—that are
needed to ensure a high quality of life for all inhabitants; (c) full
employment to all able-bodied persons; (d) free of social and
economic exploitation; (e) a harmonious, cooperative and caring
environment; (f) Antyodaya or concern for the development of
the last man; (g) effective functioning of Panchayat bodies with
people’s participation and involvement of voluntary organisations;
and (h) a vibrant cultural life that displays both modernity and
pride in Indian traditions.

The BJP is committed to taking all our villages towards this
ideal. We have taken several important steps in this direction,
the most notable among them being the blueprint of a new
comprehensive rural development initiative called PURA (Provision
of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas). PURA aims at providing

Untitled-10 26 11/7/2016 11:19:01 PM

Election Manifestoes * 27

four types of connectivity to every Indian village: Physical
Connectivity, Digital Connectivity, Knowledge Connectivity, and
Market Connectivity to every rural cluster in the country. Speedy
implementation of this programme will be our priority.

5.11 Our Vision for an Ideal Indian City

India is rapidly urbanizing. At the same time, Indian cities and
towns are groaning under unplanned and unaesthetic growth, made
evident by their overstretched infrastructure, severe shortage of
basic amenities, proliferation of slums, and unhygienic environment.
This has affected the quality of life of all sections of the urban
population most of all the urban poor. The continuance of this reality
is incompatible with our vision of India as a Developed Nation.

No previous government paid as much attention to urban
renewal as the Vajpayee Government has done since its inception.
HUDCO’s loans for urban infrastructure rose by 550% during the
past six years, compared to the previous 28 years.

Our vision of an ideal Indian city is one in which our cities
(a) provide a high quality of material and cultural life to all their
inhabitants, with strong human bonds that is the hallmark of Indian
society; (b) have good infrastructure, civic amenities, and pollution-
free environment; (c) are free of slums and illegal encroachments, and
display aesthetic city planning; (d) preserve their unique tangible
and intangible heritage; (e) are engaged in promotion knowledge
and diverse creative pursuits; (f) Have good municipal governance
with strong community participation and, above all, (g) serve as
engines of India’s rapid economic growth, providing adequate
employment opportunities and ideal conditions for entrepreneurs
and professionals to flourish in the era of globalisation.

The BJP is committed to working towards this ideal by
introducing major urban governance reforms and massively
expanding the programme for urban renewal in the coming years.

5.12 Dealing with the Challenge of Water

The BJP recognises that scarcity of water in both rural and urban
areas has assumed serious proportions in many parts of the country.
There is an urgent need for a people’s movement, supplementing
government efforts, for conservation, management and rational

Untitled-10 27 11/7/2016 11:19:01 PM

28 * Party Document Vol-1

use of this scarce resource for drinking, agriculture, industry and
domestic purposes. The problem needs a multi-pronged strategy
that combines both mega and micro initiatives. We remain fully
committed to starting work on the interlinking of rivers, with due
consideration for environmental protection and rehabilitation of
displaced people.

However, we attach greater importance to millions of local
initiatives for desilting of tanks, lakes and reservoirs, restoration
of wells, recharging of natural aquifers, building check dams,
promotion of drip irrigation, desalination of sea water, rainwater
harvesting, recycling of water, and other means of water conservation
and efficient water management. Cleaning of all polluted rivers and
traditional water bodies, with people’s participation of the kind that
was evident in olden times, should be taken up in a mission mode.

5.13 Dealing with the Challenge of Employment

The BJP recognizes that unemployment is a major problem
faced by a significant section of the Indian youth. At the same time,
we confidently state that no other government in the past paid
as much attention to dealing with this problem, and achieved so
much success, as did the NDA Government. It is our Government,
which, for the first time, promised to facilitate creation of one crore
additional employment and self-employment opportunities each
year. We have substantially succeeded in fulfilling this promise.
Between 1999-2002, for which official figures are available, 84 lakh
employment and self-employment opportunities were created on
average, per year.

The nature of employment generation has altered with the
changing nature of the economy. Government jobs and jobs in the
organized industry are shrinking not only in India and this is true
of Congress and Communist-ruled States too but all over the world.
At the same time, large-scale employment and self-employment
opportunities have come up in services and the unorganized sector
(whose preponderance in the Indian economy has been steadily
growing), housing and road construction, telecom and IT, tourism,
etc.

In the coming years, our strategy to deal with the challenge
of employment will be four-pronged:

Untitled-10 28 11/7/2016 11:19:01 PM

Election Manifestoes * 29

5.13.1 Sustaining a high rate of annual GDP growth 8% going up to
double digits and broadbasing the growth in employment-
generating sectors of the economy.

5.13.2 Higher allocation to, and better implementation of,
the Government’s employment and self-employment
generation schemes such as the Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar
Yojana, which is the biggest food-for-work programme
since Independence launched by our Government, self-
help groups, etc.

5.13.3 Evaluating every development policy and programme
from the point of view of its potential to create
employment and self-employment opportunities.
Policies and programmes that promise to deliver this
goal will be given special thrust. Thus, agri-processing,
support services for agriculture, textiles, handicrafts,
wasteland development, social forestry, housing and
construction activities, renewal of urban infrastructure
and amenities, retail trade, tourism, transportation,
etc. will be given priority in terms of investment and
facilitation.

5.13.4 Providing special thrust to vocational education and training
to match the needs of the economy. In rural areas our focus
will be mainly on skill upgradation of people engaged in
traditional occupations. In urban areas our focus will be
mainly on enhancing the employability of students and
youth, and create an aptitude for self-employment and
entrepreneurship.

5.14 Developing a Democracy of Stakeholders

The BJP is committed to continuing reforms in the financial
sector that have contributed to better performance of the corporate
sector and the evolution of well regulated stock markets. We believe
that the gains of this process must be shared more equitably. Today,
less than 2 per cent of Indians are retail investors. We believe that
the base of investment in equities must be broadened. The BJP
believes that the advantages of low interest credit must be shared
by all productive forces in society, including small businesses, the
self-employed and farmers.

Untitled-10 29 11/7/2016 11:19:02 PM

30 * Party Document Vol-1

The BJP is proud that the vigilance and intervention of the
Union Government have helped revive institutions like the UTI.
We believe that public financial institutions and corporate houses
must conduct themselves with exemplary responsibility.

5.15 Widening the Social Security Net

The BJP is proud of the NDA Government's initiative to launch
a social security scheme for 37 crore people in the unorganized
sector. Expanding its coverage and its effective implementation will
be our commitment. The BJP believes that all Indians must have
access to competitive and well regulated pension and insurance
schemes tailored to every income level. The needs of senior citizens,
widows, disabled persons, etc. will continue to receive our special
consideration. We shall ensure that money invested will be both
secure and will fetch good returns.

Focus on Social Development

The BJP believes that faster economic growth cannot be an end
in itself; rather, it is a means to ensure a high quality of life to all
citizens by fulfilling their material needs and satisfy their social,
educational and cultural aspirations.

6.1 Education for All

We believe that both society and the Government at all levels
must give top priority to meeting the goal of “Quality Education
for All” since education aids both economic growth and social
development. Its importance in the emerging Knowledge Economy
has increased manifold. Enriched human resources of our one billion
population can propel India into a higher orbit of development
with limitless possibilities in the new century.

The BJP’s ideal of good education is one expressed in Swami
Vivekananda’s profound words: “Education for Man-Making and
Nation-Building”. India needs a system of education that opens
the doors of knowledge to all citizens, develops their talents and
skills, anchors them strongly in human values and Indian culture,
reinforces their patriotism, and equips them to explore opportunities
both in India and abroad.

Because of inadequate and unbalanced attention by successive
governments in the past, India continues to face major challenges
in education. Our strategy for overcoming these challenges and
unleashing the potential of India’s enviable human resources has
the following underpinnings:

6.1.1 Steadily raising the total spending on education to 6% of
the GDP by 2010, with enlarged public-private partnership.
6.1.2 Achieving complete eradication of illiteracy within a

Untitled-10 31 11/7/2016 11:19:02 PM

32 * Party Document Vol-1

decade. For this, we will ensure that every child goes to
school, every school is made accountable to the community,
every State is made accountable for its quality education
status, and appropriate resources both from Government
and non-government sources are mobilized to match our
ambitious goals.

6.1.3 Further intensification of measures aimed at education of
the girl child, and spread of education among SCs, STs,
OBCs and minorities.

6.1.4 Improving the standards of education at all levels of the
Educational Pyramid from primary to university.

6.1.5 Making quality education affordable to a common Indian
family. No student should be deprived of access to higher
education for lack of resources. Hence, scholarships and
soft loans should be made widely available.

6.1.6 While encouraging private investment, necessary steps will
have to be taken to check commercialization of education.

6.1.7 Rectifying the biases in history education, increasing the
moral and cultural content in syllabi, and restoring the
neglected focus on character-building.

6.1.8 De-bureacratising the administration of our educational
institutions; autonomy to centers of excellence; empowering
teachers; and maximizing community participation.

6.1.9 Enlarging the partnership between Government and the
private sector, and between industry and universities, to
promote world-class R&D.

6.1.10 Making India a preferred higher education destination
for students from all over the world. This would not only
reduce huge spending abroad by rich Indians, but also
enable India to earn significantly from higher education.

6.2 Healthcare for All

The BJP believes that healthcare is a basic need and rightful
entitlement of every citizen. Hence, its provision should be made
immune to the citizen’s economic status. Wrong policies, inadequate
resource allocation, and neglect of our country’s traditional wisdom
by the Congress governments have created daunting problems in
this field. The BJP’s strategy to overcome them, and to enable India

Untitled-10 32 11/7/2016 11:19:02 PM

Election Manifestoes * 33

to move quickly towards the goal of “Health For All”, is guided
by the following principles:

6.2.1 The Centre and State Governments should together facilitate
manifold increase in spending on healthcare, with enlarged
public-private partnership.

6.2.2 The priority of public spending should be on primary
healthcare, with a focus on preventive rather than curative
measures.

6.2.3 Increasing people’s awareness about health issues and
making them take good care of themselves by cultivating
healthy habits and lifestyles; towards this end, building a
strong physical and sports culture among all age-groups.

6.2.4 Healthcare should be made affordable to the poor and
middle classes.

6.2.5 The NDA Government's good work in promoting yoga,
ayurveda, naturopathy and other systems of indigenous
medicine should be vastly intensified.

6.2.6 Private and foreign investment in tertiary and super-
specialty healthcare should be encouraged. However, all
private healthcare establishments should have enhanced
obligation for treating poor patients.

6.2.7 Public-private partnerships should be institutionalized
on the widest possible scale.

6.2.8 Concerted efforts should be made for India’s emergence
as a centre of health tourism.

6.3 Social and Economic Justice

The BJP has always been a strong votary of social justice for
SCs, STs, OBCs and other disadvantaged social groups. Going
beyond the traditional advocacy of this important cause, we
have also been consistently emphasising two related imperatives
(a) social justice is incomplete without economic justice and political
empowerment; and (b) The means to secure social justice (samajik
nyay) have to also promote social harmony (samajik samarasata).

To advance these ideals, the BJP commits itself to:
6.3.1 Strict implementation of provisions of the policy on
reservations. A major drive has to be launched for filling
up all backlogs in jobs and promotions for SCs, STs and

Untitled-10 33 11/7/2016 11:19:02 PM

34 * Party Document Vol-1

OBCs.

6.3.2 Private sector enterprises will be incentivised for
creating more educational, training, employment and
entrepreneurship opportunities for SCs and STs.

6.3.3 Strict enforcement of laws to check atrocities against SCs,
STs and other weaker sections.

6.3.4 Provision of greater financial resources and better
managerial resources for the delivery of education,
healthcare, and other social security services to the poor
and weaker sections of society.

6.3.5 Improvement in the functioning of various Commissions
and Finance Corporations for the development of SCs and
STs.

6.3.6 Operationalisation of the newly announced Commission
for Nomadic and Denotified Tribes and development
corporation for the shepherd community.

6.3.7 Safeguarding and promoting the economic wellbeing of
fishermen and others engaged in traditional occupations.

6.3.8 Serious consideration to the recommendations of the newly
established Commission for examining reservations for
the poor among “Forward Classes”.

6.4 Welfare of Tribals

Of all the deprived and neglected sections of society, tribal
Indians suffered the most during the long Congress rule. Their
ability to benefit from the policy of reservations in education and
jobs has remained far less than that of the Scheduled Castes and
OBCs. Many of them have been uprooted from their habitations and
livelihoods in forests. Frequently they are victims of exploitation
by powerful local interests and harassment by the police and
government officials. They rank the lowest in literacy, longevity,
health status and other indicators of human development.

The BJP is committed to ending the plight of India’s tribals.
Ours was the first government, since Independence, to set up a
separate ministry for tribal welfare and also a separate commission
and a separate finance and development corporation for tribals.
We shall take necessary steps for regularization of land rights of
tribals living on forest lands and for promoting their economic

Untitled-10 34 11/7/2016 11:19:02 PM

Election Manifestoes * 35

activities based on forest produce. These measures, in addition to
providing them livelihood security, will also help in preservation
of our forests. The BJP believes that, as the original inhabitants
of forests with a deep attachment to their natural endowments,
tribals are the best protectors of our depleting forest and wildlife
resources. We will also take steps to preserve tribal art and culture,
honour tribal heroes, and frustrate efforts to create a wedge between
tribals and non-tribals.

6.5 Women’s Empowerment

The BJP is committed to gender equality and justice. We
consider educational, social, economic and political empowerment of
women to be one of the preconditions for making India a Developed
Nation. Our Party is committed to providing women an enabling
environment free from injustice and violence in the public as well
as the private sphere, which would pave the way for women to
contribute to every walk of life. We would develop strategies to
enable women in balancing work and family by introducing a
national childcare plan, decent wages, workplace flexibility, and
greater career opportunities.

The BJP believes that every able-bodied woman should have
at least some source of livelihood, so that she can enjoy economic
independence within the framework of a harmonious family.
Education not only equips her to raise her economic and social
status, but also helps our country realize many of its developmental
goals. Accordingly, the BJP commits itself to eliminating gender
disparities in both education and property rights. In official records of
schemes such as giving land or a house, woman will be made a joint
beneficiary having precedence over man. Opportunities for women
in training, employment, self-employment and entrepreneurship
will be expanded. Simultaneously, we will intensify governmental
and societal efforts to ensure safety for women, and clamp down on
female foeticide, dowry, trafficking and rape.

India has a very rich tradition of the social reforms movement
where men championed the cause of women. In the 21st century,
it is once again necessary for men to play a constructive role in
establishing gender equality. They can play an especially crucial
role in ensuring dignity of women and eliminating violence against

Untitled-10 35 11/7/2016 11:19:03 PM

36 * Party Document Vol-1

them.

Ours was the first party to raise the demand for 33% reservation
for women in Parliament and State legislatures. We remain
committed to this goal. It is well known that the NDA Government
did its best to enact the Women’s Reservation Bill. However, the
Congress and some other parties sabotaged it. The BJP is prepared
to support any alternative proposal for women’s reservation, on
which broad consensus can be forged. We believe that the nation’s
commitment to take this revolutionary step forward can no longer
be kept in abeyance.

6.6 Population Control

The BJP is convinced that neglect of the imperative of
population control is one of the main causes for the shortcomings
in India’s all-round development. The Vajpayee Government has
taken steps to overcome this neglect. We believe that the goals and
targets set in the National Population Policy can be realized only
by making it a people’s movement. State Governments — especially
in those States that are lagging behind—and communities have
to be energized. The BJP also believes that the time has come to
introduce a set of incentives and non-coercive disincentives for the
success of this campaign. We are in favour of providing incentives
for the girl child within a two-child norm. Our Party shall build
consensus over ways that would ensure success of this mission.

6.7 Securing a Bright Future for India’s Children

India is home to the largest child population in the world.
Every fifth child in the world is an Indian. Hence, what happens
to India’s children will determine not only India’s future, but also
the future of the world. For the BJP, securing a bright future for
India’s children is both a moral obligation and a matter of political
urgency. We are proud of the Vajpayee Government's initiatives in
this regard for example, making free and compulsory elementary
education a fundamental right through a Constitutional amendment;
launching ‘Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’, the biggest ever educational
programme since Independence; and vastly enlarging the scope of
the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) to cover nearly
all the blocks in the country.

Untitled-10 36 11/7/2016 11:19:03 PM

Election Manifestoes * 37

We are committed to further intensifying our efforts to put
the needs, aspirations and rights of children at the heart of our
development agenda. Drastic reduction in infant and maternal
mortality, special focus on the education of the girl child, ending
malnutrition among children from poor families, elimination of
child labour, and the care of orphans will be our priority.

6.8 Unleashing India’s ‘Yuva Shakti’

Demographically India is a Young Nation. Nearly 65 per cent
of our population is below the age of 35. This ‘yuva shakti’ (youth
power) is a source of immense strength and hope for the India
of our dreams in the 21st century. Our first priority is to ensure
that every young Indian is gainfully employed or self-employed,
securing not only their own livelihood but also contributing to
their family’s well-being and to the country’s progress. By their
very nature, young people are an overflowing reservoir of energy,
enthusiasm, creativity, idealism and patriotism. It is the duty of
the government and society to create opportunities for the full
flowering of these attributes. Care should be taken to see that
their grievances and resentment over any issue are not exploited
by parochial and anti-social elements.

The spirit of adventure among the youth and their natural
inclination for voluntary service need to be promoted. Infrastructure
for sports, arts, cultural activities and social service, and support
for youth organizations engaged in these activities, need to be
stepped up at all levels from the national to the local. In particular,
Indian sports, which have suffered marginalisation, deserve special
encouragement. We are proud that the Vajpayee Government not
only created a separate Ministry for Sports and Youth Affairs for
the first time since Independence, but also effected a five-fold
increase in the allocation for sports in the Tenth Plan. The BJP’s
vision is to see that India emerges as a major Sports Power in the
world over the next ten years. We will work for the realization 0
this vision. Oo

Good Governance Issues

7.1 Governance Reforms

The principal aspect of the Congress misrule was its failure to
transform India’s hard-won Swaraj (self-governance) into Su-raj
(good governance). It caused the government to enter every sphere
of our national life, excessively enlarging the ordinary citizen’s
interface with the public authority. The overload of the government
has led to inefficiency, harassment and corruption. Rather than being
at the service of the people, the state machinery has reduced them
to being supplicants. Its lack of transparency and accountability
has alienated the people. Its highly bureaucratic working has
undermined their entrepreneurial energies and discouraged citizens’
initiatives. In the absence of people’s active participation, policies
and programmes frequently fail to deliver desired results.

Punitive levels of taxation created a national culture of
dishonesty. The licence-permit-quota raj produced a shortage
economy and bred corruption and nepotism. The government was
often the cause of the problem and not the solution.

The BJP is committed to making the role of the government
more focused and effective by initiating a set of reforms for
Good Governance with the same priority as economic reforms.
Specifically, we will make the government's interaction with
citizens more people-friendly and service-oriented. We will make
the government's principal role in the economy that of a facilitator
and creator of the necessary environment for the creative energies
of the people to find full expression. We will reduce discretionary
powers vested with public authorities, and base the exercise of such
powers on objective criteria. We will ensure exemplary punishment
for infringement.

Untitled-10 38 11/7/2016 11:19:03 PM

Election Manifestoes * 39

The BJP is committed to removing all non-financial barriers to
economic growth such as delays in clearances and decision making;
obsolete laws, unnecessary procedures, and habitual litigation;
lack of adequate empowerment of officers at appropriate levels;
and lack of a level-playing field in the functioning environment
of executives in the public sector vis-a-vis their private sector
counterparts.

7.2 Re-orienting the Priorities of Government

The BJP believes that the thrust of the Union government in
future should be on the core areas of national security, internal
security, macro-economic management, and creation and upgrading
of infrastructure. It should also expand the scope and improve the
quality of services and amenities in the social sector, particularly
targeted at the poor and disadvantaged communities. The
government's traditional function of administration and upholding
the rule of law and justice will have to be further strengthened.

In the economic sphere, the government should progressively
withdraw from involvement in non-priority sectors. It should create
more avenues for entrepreneurship in a well-regulated competitive
framework. In general, it should reduce its role in manufacturing
and services business, where the private sector can serve the people
better except where it is required for strategic reasons, to prevent
private sector monopolies, run important utilities, or in exceptional
circumstances.

At the same time, there is a need to enhance systemic
capabilities for better policy formulation in the social sector, better
designing of schemes and programmes, and, above all, better
monitoring of their implementation. Towards this end, there is a
need to maximize community participation and involve voluntary
organizations, professional experts at all levels. In short, efficiency,
accountability, responsiveness, pro-poor attitude, and treating
the people as one’s masters will be the hallmark of administrative
reforms in the years to come.

7.3 Judicial Reforms

The BJP is firmly committed to the independence of the
judiciary. At the same time, we acknowledge that judicial bottlenecks

Untitled-10 39 11/7/2016 11:19:03 PM

40 * Party Document Vol-1

have become a major source of harassment for ordinary citizens.
They are also acting as an obstacle to our economy growing faster.
Therefore, we shall speed up judicial and legal reforms on an urgent
basis. Our specific commitments are:
7.3.1 Considerable enhancement in allocations to improve the
physical and operational infrastructure of our courts;
7.3.2 Increasing the number of courts and appointment of more
judges at all levels;
7.3.3 Reform of the criminal justice system to make dispensation
of justice simpler, quicker and more effective;
7.3.4 Extension of Fast-Track Courts to all layers of the judiciary;
7.3.5 Expansion of alternative dispute redressal mechanisms
through Lok Adalats and Tribunals;
7.3.6 Setting up a National Judicial Commission for appointment
of judges and ensuring judicial ethics.

7.4 Electoral Reforms

The NDA Government has introduced certain important
electoral reforms such as rightsizing of the Council of Ministers
at the Centre and in States, open ballot in Rajya Sabha elections to
check misuse of money power, the facility of proxy vote to defence
personnel, etc. We have made political funding more transparent.
The BJP will pursue this agenda vigorously by working towards
state funding of elections. We shall evolve a consensus to prevent
entry of criminal elements into politics. In cooperation with other
political parties, the BJP will consistently strive to raise the standards
of Parliament and State Legislatures and making their functioning
more effective.

The BJP firmly holds that the high offices of the Indian State
legislative, executive and judicial should be occupied only by those
who are India’s natural citizens by their Indian origin.

7.5 Effective Empowerment of Panchayati Raj Institutions

The BJP believes in Gandhiji’s philosophy that Ram Rajya
cannot become a reality without Gram Rajya. We are committed
to decentralisation and grassroots democracy, with the village as
the unit, through transfer of power from the Centre to the States,
from State governments to Panchayati Raj Institutions and from

Untitled-10 40 11/7/2016 11:19:03 PM

Election Manifestoes * 41

impersonal bureaucracies to communities. We believe that effective
empowerment of Panchayati Raj Institutions is the most urgent good
governance task for achieving the cherished ideal of speedy and
all-round rural development. The 73rd and 74th Amendments to
the Constitution, introduced by the Congress government, devolved
many important functions to Panchayati Raj Institutions. However,
they failed to equip these institutions with necessary financial and
administrative powers to discharge their Constitutional obligations.
The BJP will remove this shortcoming by enacting, if necessary, a
new Constitutional amendment.

The institution of the Gram Sabha will be strengthened.
We believe that it is the most effective platform for promoting
grassroots democracy, since it enables all the people in a village to
discuss every developmental work, scrutinise the allocation and
spending of funds, and evaluate the performance of panchayat
and government functionaries.

7.6 Improving Fiscal Health of State Governments

The BJP believes that the distortions introduced by Congress
governments in the past have undermined the financial viability
of States. Several policy and administrative measures have become
necessary to stop unproductive expenditure and enhance the
resource mobilisation powers of States and institutions of local
government. The BJP will strive to build political consensus, which
is critical for achieving this objective.

The NDA Government has initiated the process of liberating
India from an overdose of controls. It has abolished many state
monopolies, simplified procedures, cut red tape in many places
and eased controls. The BJP is committed to a simplified and low
tax regime. Lower taxes encourage entrepreneurship, less tax
evasion, a dynamic work culture and enable people to save more
and spend more on themselves, their families and their communities.
At the same time, efforts will be intensified to further expand the
population of tax payers to reflect the growing preponderance
of services in our economy, ensure better compliance, and plug
significant leakage of tax revenue at various levels.

Untitled-10 41 11/7/2016 11:19:04 PM

42 * Party Document Vol-1

7.7 War on Corruption

The BJP believes that corruption is the greatest hurdle in
India’s developmental march. It has weakened the moral fabric
of our society and polity. The long years of Congress rule have
created a system of governance and administration where power is
frequently misused for personal gain. Ordinary citizens often have
difficulty getting their work done in government offices, without
paying bribes. The BJP believes that the menace of corruption
has to be fought at all levels. This requires both systemic reforms
especially electoral and administrative reforms — and heightened
public action. No single political party can win the fight against
corruption on its own. However, the BJP is committed to playing
a leading role in its eradication.

7.8 Empowering Civil Society

After Independence, the Congress Party let the country down
on good governance. It also created an atmosphere of “statism”,
which made the Government machinery all-powerful and the people
excessively dependent on it. As a result, the people’s initiative and
their efforts to solve their own local problems took a back seat.
The Government did not sufficiently trust the organizations of
civil society, and the people in turn did not trust the Government
to deliver. The lack of people’s participation in government-led
development became one of the principal reasons for India’s slow
progress.

The BJP believes that this has to be changed by empowering
communities, voluntary organizations, not-for-profit groups, and
respected senior citizens in society. The NGO sector, too, needs to
apply self-correctives for it to play its role in the developmental
process. We believe that there is a big scope for enlisting the
cooperation of religious establishments of all denominations,
which command large followings, in schemes and programmes
for social development. We also believe that empowerment of the
Civil Society will help in achieving dispute resolution ranging from
local disputes over minor issues to major ones over contentious
issues — outside the realm of the judiciary and government. This
vision is consistent with the traditional Indian approach to dispute
resolution.

7.9 Strengthening India’s links with the Indian Diaspora

The BJP believes that the growing achievements of the vast
Indian diaspora are a matter of pride and a source of strength for
India. Similarly, India’s growing strength and its rising global
stature are also a matter of pride and a source of strength for the
Indian diaspora. Together we constitute the Great Indian Family.
We are proud of the NDA Government's unprecedented efforts
to broaden and deepen the emotional, social and economic links
of NRIs and PIOs with their cultural motherland. These links will
have to be comprehensively strengthened in the years to come.

India and the World

With the world recognizing India as an emerging power, our foreign
policy has to become far more active, creative and sure-footed. This
process has already begun under the NDA Government, which
has launched a number of bold initiatives over the past five years.
Our Look-East Policy has greatly strengthened the India-ASEAN
relationship, reinforcing our close cultural links with this region
in the past with new links in trade, technology and transport. We
have recently given economic cooperation within SAARC a new
impetus, creating the promise of free-trade in South Asia. Our
economic cooperation with China is growing at an amazing speed.
We have further strengthened our strategic partnership with Russia,
expanded relations with USA, intensified our dialogue with the
European Union, and rejuvenated traditional bonds with countries
in West Asia, Central Asia, and Africa.
The BJP believes that this new pro-active and self-confident
thrust of India’s foreign policy should be continued. Our aim should
be to secure for India a steadily broadening role in international
affairs, so that we can contribute meaningfully to the global
community’s collective ability to deal with the challenges of today
and tomorrow.
The broad contours of the BJP’s vision for India’s external
affairs in the coming years are:
8.1 Continue the dialogue process with Pakistan for a lasting
solution to all the outstanding issues, including Jammu
& Kashmir, on the basis of the Joint Statement issued in
Islamabad in February 2004.

8.2 Work towards realizing the vision for a South Asian
Economic Union with a common currency for the region.

Untitled-10 44 11/7/2016 11:19:04 PM

Election Manifestoes * 45

8.3 Continue the dialogue process with China to achieve a
mutually satisfactory resolution of the boundary issue,
which is an objective of strategic interest for us.

8.4 Intensify efforts to create suitable alliances to secure access
to new energy sources.

9. Conclusion
“Shaktishali Bharat ke liye Shaktishali BJP”

For the past five years, Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari
Vajpayee has given India a purposeful and dynamic government,
ending the debilitating period of destabilization perpetuated by
the Congress. Under him, India has entered the 21st Century with
greater self-confidence, vastly enhanced capacity for achievement,
and soaring expectations.

The remarkable progress made in the past six years is,
however, only a beginning. India still has a long way to realise its
full potential begins to flower. Inspirational leadership and good
governance have put development on top of the political agenda.
The BJP is committed to carrying forward this process and further
strengthening it over the next five years and beyond.

Our vision is to make India a Developed Nation by 2020; strong
in security, strong in national unity, strong in economy, strong in
democracy, strong in diplomacy, and, above all, strong in every
parameter of human development of all her one billion people.

Our vision is to make the 21st Century India’s Century.

History has chosen the BJP to provide political leadership to
our national endeavour to realize this vision. “Shaktishali Bharat
ke liye Shaktishali BJP” is our clarion call.

A renewed and stronger mandate in Election 2004 an absolute
majority for the BJP and a two-thirds majority for the NDA is the
crucial first step to realise this dream.

To recall the Prime Minister’s ringing words, “India’s destiny
is linked to victory for the BJP and the NDA.”

A renewed mandate for Shri Vajpayee is a mandate for India’s
renewal.

Introduction

The first National Democratic Alliance Government was elected to
office in 1998. It was re-elected in 1999. Under Prime Minister Shri
Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s visionary leadership, the NDA is seeking a
renewed mandate, in the 2004 General Election, to serve the nation
for another five years.

The NDA had promised to end political instability created
by the Congress party’s dangerous destabilizing tactics. We have
done so by giving India a stable and purposive government under
an able leader.

Adhering to the canons of ‘Coalition Dharma’ mutual trust,
regular consultation, consensus building, and acceptance of a
common approach, the NDA has shown how a coalition can work
unitedly to fulfill the people’s aspirations.

We have lived up to our 1999 manifesto declaration: ‘The
NDA is a representative of both national interests and regional
aspirations. The NDA is ... the mirror-image of our nation’s unity
in multifaceted diversity, rich pluralism, and federalism.’

The NDA Government has taken India forward on all fronts
during the past five years. Our common manifesto in the 1999
elections was called, ‘An Agenda For a Proud, Prosperous India’.
Today, India is more prosperous than ever before. There is greater
pride, hope, and self-confidence among Indians than ever earlier.
Today, India stands tall on the international stage, with greater
prestige and recognition.

In five years, our country has demonstrated its ability
to overcome the legacy of past problems and to embrace the
opportunities of the 21st century. There is peace on the Indo-Pak
border, entirely due to the Government's firm but bold efforts to

Untitled-10 49 11/7/2016 11:19:05 PM

50 * Party Document Vol-1

enable bilateral relations to move from seemingly never-ending
enmity to amity. An atmosphere has been created for resolving all
outstanding issues through dialogue. This positive development
is pregnant with possibilities not only for India and Pakistan, but
also for the future of South Asia.

Jammu & Kashmir basks again in the sunshine of regained
peace, well set now on the road to development. The holding of
free and fair elections in 2002, and the commitment to a dialogue
process, has generated new hope in the State. Troubled parts of the
North-East are seeing fruits of the NDA Government's consistent
pursuit of peace and conflict-resolution through dialogue. The NDA
Government is now resolving the problems left in these regions as
legacies of long Congress misrule.

We have finally left behind our years of stagnation and slow
economic growth that marked most of the first fifty years of our
independence. A GDP growth rate of 8%, which our opponents had
cynically derided as ‘Mungeri Lal ke haseen sapne’, has become
real and will be exceeded, despite the country having faced a
string of natural calamities. Last year, our efficient and effective
management of severe drought situation in fourteen States, was
without precedent. Prices of essential commodities remain under
control.

Agricultural production will surpass all previous records.
Our forex reserves exceed the $110 billion mark.

Many areas of India’s manufacturing sector, earlier written
off by critics, have now attained global competitiveness. The past
five years have not only brought pride to the ‘Made in India’ label,
but have also made ‘Served from India’ the first choice of global
companies. This sunrise sector has generated new employment.
This new offshoot of the Knowledge Economy complements India’s
globally recognized strengths in software exports, which have grown
more than five times in the last five years to cross Rs. 48,000 crore.

Poor and inadequate infrastructure, which was the debilitating
legacy of the Congress years, has been replaced by a world-class
infrastructure for India, built by Indians, in India. We have set in
motion what the Prime Minister has aptly termed as a ‘Connectivity
Revolution’. Telecom connectivity, Internet connectivity, highway
connectivity, and rural roads connectivity are just the initial, visible
successes of this revolution. We are determined to replicate these

Untitled-10 50 11/7/2016 11:19:05 PM

Election Manifestoes * 51

successes in other critical areas of infrastructure power, railways,
airports, ports, irrigation, etc. where bottlenecks have severely
constrained economic growth and employment generation.

The past five years has seen a huge boom in housing
construction. We have over-fulfilled our promise, made in 1999,
of facilitating construction of twenty lakh new houses each year.
We take pride in the fact that the Vajpayee Government built more
houses for the rural poor under the Indira Awaas Yojana in the last
five years than the Congress or Congress-supported governments
did in the previous fourteen years since the inception of the scheme.

Creating one crore additional employment opportunities a
year was an important promise contained in our 1999 manifesto.
We have substantially fulfilled that promise. Between 2000-2003, 82
lakh employment and self-employment opportunities were created
on average each year. The Rs. 1,000-crore Sampoorna Grameen
Rozgar Yojana, started by our Government, is the biggest food-
for-work program since Independence.

Our Government launched some of the biggest-ever social
development initiatives in the world. These include the Antyodaya
Anna Yojana and the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. The coverage of
the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), which is the
world’s largest early childcare program, was greatly expanded.
Major initiatives, such as establishment of a separate ministry for
tribal affairs, were taken to promote the cause of social justice.

We now seek a renewed term to carry forward our agenda.
Responding to the aspirations and expectations of the people, the
NDA has made ‘Development’, ‘Good Governance’, and ‘Peace’, as
the main issues for Election 2004. Our commitment to these issues
is further affirmed in this Manifesto.

India is prosperous, and developing. Millions of Indians
have got employment, bought houses, use cell phones, and are
getting better education for their children. Yet, millions more
still await their chance of benefiting from and contributing to the
Great Indian Dream. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's advocacy of
‘Antyodaya’, the NDA Government is committed to reaching the
fruits of development to all; for we believe that the deprived and
the denied have the first call on the resources and the attention of
the Indian State.

Our vision
India as a Developed Nation

Our Goal: 8 to 10% GDP growth rate on a sustainable basis
over the next five years, with eradication of poverty by 2015. Clear
five-yearly milestones for economic growth and social development
will be set for each State and district.

Our Guiding Principle: Faster growth with employment,
equity, social justice, reduction in regional imbalances, and the
urban-rural divide.

The NDA believes that GDP growth, at an annual rate of 8
to 10% on a sustainable basis, is achievable. This will realize our
strategic vision of making India a Developed Nation. We have
full faith in the capacity of our hardworking kisans and workers,
enterprising businessmen and traders, innovative managers,
professionals, talented scientists, and dedicated administrators to
achieve this goal.

The NDA is committed to making India an economic
superpower through a seven-pronged strategy of:

1. India as the food factory of the world.

India as the global manufacturing hub.

India as the service provider to the world.
India as the centre of the knowledge economy.
India as the global tourism destination.

India as the global healthcare destination.

NDT PWN

India as the global higher education destination.

Agriculture

The NDA Government gives highest priority to agriculture,
since it is the mainstay of India’s overall development. Our main
objectives are:

1. Bring vibrancy to the rural economy.

2. Make agriculture remunerative even to small and marginal
farmers by doubling the income of kisans by 2010, reducing
the cost of cultivation, enhancing yields, and increasing
prices receivable by farmers. We have, for the first time
since Independence, set up a National Kisan Commission
to address these imperatives.

3. Double the rate of growth of public and private investment
in agriculture.

4. Make India’s eastern States, which have fertile land and
plenty of water, a new food basket of India.

5. Increase the access of our farmers to markets, to competitive
sources of finance, and to knowledge that allows them to
compete in a global economy.

6. Increase value addition and reduce wastage at every stage
in the food chain linking the kisan to the consumer, so that
both benefit.

7. Make India the ‘Food Factory’ of the world by producing
high quality processed foods for global markets.

For achieving these objectives, the Prime Minister will formally
launch the Second Green Revolution on August 15, 2004. Since
agriculture is a state subject, the NDA will make efforts to secure
the participation of States in implementing the following tasks
under the Second Green Revolution, which will lead to an ‘Ever
Green’ Revolution.

Untitled-10 53 11/7/2016 11:19:05 PM

54 * Party Document Vol-1

Land, Water, and Power

1. Work will commence on the River-Linking Project, whose
principal beneficiaries will be our farmers in water-scarce
areas.

2. Completion of all the ongoing irrigation projects (major,
medium, and minor) within five years to create irrigation
for an additional 35 million hectares of land.

3. A Master Plan for ground water recharge will be
implemented throughout the nation.

4. Mandatory community participation in planning, execution,
and maintenance of irrigation projects through mechanisms
such as Water Users’ Associations.

5. Every district will draw up a comprehensive water
management and soil enrichment strategy.

6. Acampaign will be launched to encourage drip irrigation,
sprinkler irrigation and greenhouse technology. Land under
these water-efficient systems will be increased five-fold in
five years. Our slogan for this campaign would be ‘More
Crop per Drop’.

7. A National Mission for Rainfed Agriculture will be launched
to benefit two-thirds of India’s cropped area, and 80% of
small and marginal farmers who are dependent on rains.
It will focus on the watershed approach, use of better
seeds, dissemination of relevant farm technologies, soil
enrichment, and commercialization of everything that
grows on arid lands, including weeds and wild plants.

8. Adequate supply of quality power will be ensured to all
farmers by 2009.

9. Wasteland development for agriculture, horticulture,
afforestation, bio-mass production, cultivation of bamboo
and bio-fuels, and other productive uses will be taken
up on a mission mode. All programs, currently under
different ministries, will be brought under a single
agency. The National Wasteland Development Board
will be reactivated to put at least 25 million hectares of
wasteland to productive use by 2009 that is, by doubling
the rate of coverage under all the existing programs. The
Centre will draw up a model law for better management
of land and other natural resources through community

Untitled-10 54 11/7/2016 11:19:05 PM

Election Manifestoes * 55

participation, private investments, corporate-cooperative
collaboration, and by making landless labourers, small
farmers, ex-servicemen, and unemployed youth partners in
every initiative for wasteland development. The model law
will be commended to State Governments to pass similar
legislations and set up suitably empowered authorities to
implement this important mission.

10. Organic farming will be promoted to reverse soil
degradation produce ‘natural’ foods that are becoming
popular the world over. Fiscal and other forms of support
will be given for production of bio-fertilizers and bio-
pesticides.

11. Leasing in and leasing out of lands within farmers would
be permitted through enabling legislation.

12. With the cooperation of the State governments, all revenue
records and land transfer systems will be computerized
and linked to a Geographical Information System.

Finance and Insurance

1. Greater Plan Funds shall be earmarked for agriculture,
irrigation, rural development and allied areas.

2. A Task Force will be set up to recommend, within the first
six months, policy and institutional measures to promote
private sector investment in agriculture, especially in
small and medium-scale irrigation projects, farm R&D,
human resource development, post-harvest management,
and marketing. Public and private investments, as well
as investments by farmers themselves, will be synergized
through partnerships. It needs to be underscored that
private investment in agriculture does not mean corporate
farming.

3. Timely and adequate farm credit to kisans is as important
as timely and adequate water for his crops. Therefore,
steps will be taken to ensure enhanced credit flow to
the sector, make credit affordable at interests lower than
prime lending rates (PLR), eliminate procedural delays,
and introduce greater competition in credit delivery. The
process of giving all eligible farmers a Kisan Credit Card
will be completed before August 15, 2004. Card-holders

Untitled-10 55 11/7/2016 11:19:06 PM

56 * Party Document Vol-1

will be able to use ATM facility wherever it exists. Our
aim will be to create a well-developed farm credit system,
which will end the need for farmers to go to money lenders.

4. Projects under the newly announced Loknayak Jaiprakash
Narayan Fund of Rs. 50,000 crore for agriculture
infrastructure and credit will be given fast-track clearance.

5. The Government will give priority attention to strengthening
cooperative banks and other cooperative credit institutions.
The Rs. 15,000-crore fund announced for this purpose in
the interim budget will be made operational. Necessary
steps will be taken to ensure that cooperative institutions
are run on professional and sound commercial lines, while
retaining their democratic character.

6. All States will be encouraged to bring their cooperative
laws in conformity with the Multi-State Cooperative Act
passed by the Centre.

7. Full support will be provided for setting up cold storages,
godowns, grain banks, and fodder banks. Kisans keeping
their produce in accredited godowns/grain banks will
be entitled to avail bank credit with the introduction of
Negotiable Warehouse Receipts.

8. The comprehensive crop insurance scheme and the newly
launched farm income insurance scheme will be more
intensively and efficiently implemented.

Technology, Training, and Extension Services

1. Launch of a national program to use bio-technology for
evolving plants that consume less water, are drought-
resistant, contain more nutrition, give higher yield, and
are environmentally safe.

2. Resources for agricultural R&D will be trebled in the
next five years. Its focus on new yield-enhancing and
cost-reducing agriculture practices, new seeds, etc. To
close the gap between ‘Lab to Land’, multiple kinds of
partnerships will be established between the Indian Council
for Agricultural Research (ICAR), Krishi Vigyan Kendras,
agriculture universities, agri-business companies, and
farmers’ organizations.

3. Agriculture extension and consultancy services will be

Untitled-10 56 11/7/2016 11:19:06 PM

Election Manifestoes * 57

made a thrust area, with private sector participation.
Necessary bank credit and institutional support will be
made available for the establishment of at least one ‘Krishi
Seva Kendra’ in every village. The ‘Kisan Call Centre’
service (which uses a nationwide toll-free telephone
number 1551. will be made operational nationwide
and in all local languages. Besides benefiting farmers,
these agri-consultancy services will create employment
and income-enhancing opportunities for over five lakh
educated youth and local agriculture experts.

4. Opportunities for education and training in agriculture
and allied activities will be vastly expanded. Our aim will
be to ensure that every farmer undergoes some training or
participates in some farm-education program every year.

5. Acomprehensive, countrywide program will be launched
for the technological improvement of farm machinery,
implements, and tools.

Agricultural Markets

1. States will be given incentives to amend the Agricultural
Produce and Marketing Committee (APMC) Act and
abolish mandi taxes. This will enable farmers to access
competitive markets, sell their produce directly to
processing industries and to consumers, thus realizing
better prices.

2. All the remaining restrictions on the free movement of
agricultural goods across any part of the country will be
removed within one year. The Essential Commodities Act
will be revised.

3. ARs. 1,000 crore Mandi Development Fund will be created
to support modernization of agriculture markets.

4. Commodity exchanges will be encouraged to reach futures
trading services to all farmers through smaller contract
sizes and by covering a wider range of crops. This will
lessen the dependence on Minimum Support Prices.

5. The present system of setting Minimum Support Prices
by the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices will
be reviewed to further benefit all kisans.

6. The present system of procurement through the Food

Untitled-10 57 11/7/2016 11:19:06 PM

58 * Party Document Vol-1

Corporation of India will be revamped to make it cheaper
to buy, store, transport, and export food grains.

7. A chain of farmers’ haats (markets), on the pattern of
‘Ryuthu Bazaar’ in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, will
be established throughout the country, where farmers can
sell directly to customers.

Food Processing

1. The NDA believes that the food processing industry can
make our rural economy vibrant in the same manner that
IT has made our national economy prosper. Currently, we
process only 2% of the value of our agricultural produce.
A Task Force shall come up with an action plan to raise
this to 10% in five years. It will comprehensively address
the main problems facing India’s food processing industry:
size, fragmentation, inefficiency, low value-addition, low
quality standards, and inadequate logistical support. It will
enable the industry to meet the needs of Indian consumers
both at the low end and the high end. It will enable industry
to access agriculture produce directly from farmers, and
suggest ways to step up exports, including to organized
retail outlets abroad.

2. Tariff and investment support for setting up food processing
industries, especially in backward regions, will be stepped
up.

3. The foremost task in food processing in India is to reduce
the distance between production and processing. Therefore,
every rural branch of a bank will be required to identify
agro-processing potential in its region and finance such
enterprises. Local administration will be required to
provide necessary infrastructure support. We shall set up
a chain of Primary Processing Centres close to the farmers.
These will sort, grade, process, store, and pack agricultural
and horticultural produce for shipment to markets and
further value-addition.

4. A Unified Food Law, the lack of which is a critical
impediment in the faster development of food-processing
industries, will be enacted within the first six months.

5. An independent Food Regulatory Authority will be set

Untitled-10 58 11/7/2016 11:19:06 PM

Election Manifestoes * 59

up within six months. This shall be responsible for setting
and enforcing standards for all food products.

6. A Task Force will be set up, within first three months, to
recommend short-term and long-term measures to address
the problems faced by sugarcane growers and sugar mills,
and to enable Indian sugar industry to become a major
player in global markets. Production of ethanol and power
through co-generation plants will be stepped up.

7. India is the largest milk producer in the world. Yet, less
than 5% of milk production is processed. A Dairy Industry
Development Plan will be drawn up, within the first six
months, with the principal aim of enhancing rural incomes
and employment generation. It will provide increased
fiscal and investment support for dairy units, especially in
northern and eastern States. The focus of this plan will be
doubling capacity in five years, technology upgradation,
expansion of the domestic market, and realization of the
industry’s full export potential. It will also address the
downstream side of the industry — better species, fodder,
veterinary services, credit needs of kisans, etc.

8. Major thrust will be given to the poultry industry to double
egg production, quadruple poultry meat production, and
increase exports from Rs. 250 crore to Rs. 1,000 crore. This
is expected to increase employment in poultry from the
current 20 lakh to 50 lakh in five years. Poultry farming will
be recognized as an agricultural activity and all benefits
applicable to agriculture will be extended to it.

9. Anexperts’ committee will be set up, within thirty days, to
recommend measures to minimize wastage and damages
along the food chain.

Crops

1. An action plan for massive crop diversification, multi-
cropping, and doubling per-acre yields of all crops will
be prepared. Every village will be encouraged to set its
own yearly targets. Successful farmers will be suitably
recognized.

2. Efforts will be intensified to achieve self-sufficiency in
pulses and oil-seeds in five years.

Untitled-10 59 11/7/2016 11:19:06 PM

60 * Party Document Vol-1

3. Horticulture and floriculture production will be doubled in
five years. Vegetable cultivation and mushroom farming,
especially near towns and cities will be promoted.

4. Additional measures will be initiated for addressing the
problems faced by growers of plantation crops — tea, coffee,
coconut, areca nut, rubber, cashew and spices, for enabling
India to retain its leadership position in these crops.

5. The national missions for development of bio-fuels and
bamboo, which were launched last year, will be made
operational. Cultivation of medicinal plants and aromatic
plants, which have considerable export potential, will be
further promoted.

6. A Technology Mission for improving jute production and
value-addition will be launched.

Animal husbandry and Fisheries

1. Animal husbandry, which provides full and partial
employment to over two crore Indians, will be fully
promoted to achieve the ends of rural prosperity and social
justice. A National Cattle Development Board will be set
up with adequate budgetary support. Among other things,
it will prepare a program for improvement of livestock
breeds, with a major thrust on genetic improvement
of indigenous cattle, buffalo, and other animals linked
to the rural economy. Establishment of Goshalas and
Pinjrapoles will be encouraged. Efforts will be made to
evolve consensus for passing a Central legislation for
protection of cow and her progeny. Recommendations of
the newly-established National Cattle Commission will be
implemented.

2. A National Commission for Fisheries and Aquaculture
will be set up for promoting all-round development of
marine and inland fisheries, and speedy socio-economic
progress of fishermen. Deep sea fishing industry will be
developed to take advantage of India’s long coastline and
its exclusive economic zone. Fishermen’s cooperatives
will be helped to modernize their trawlers, set up cold
storages and processing plants, and establish direct
linkages with domestic and foreign markets.

Untitled-10 60 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM

Election Manifestoes * 61

3. India is the second largest wool producer in the world.
However, our wool industry is by and large at a low level
of quality and value realization. An action plan will be
prepared for its modernization and expansion. The newly
established Development and Finance Corporation for the
Shepherd Community will be made operational.

Agricultural Workers

Effective steps will be taken to ensure sustainable year-long
employment, with minimum wages for agricultural workers. They
will be brought under the social security scheme for unorganized
workers and the proposed Antyodaya Swasthya Yojana. They
will be given priority in rural housing. Training programs for
raising their productivity and skills will be encouraged.

Other issues

1. Women play a major, albeit unrecognized, role in
Indian agriculture. A special scheme will be launched
to empower women in kisan families, enrich their
capabilities, and augment their incomes.

2. An extensive campaign will be launched to educate
Indian kisans about the WTO Agreement on Agriculture,
the challenges and opportunities in global trade in
agriculture after the removal of Quantitative Restrictions,
and how a partnership between the government,
businesses, cooperatives, and kisans can help the country
meet the challenges and capture the opportunities.

The ‘Second Green Revolution’ will follow a strategy distinctly
different from the one that defined the First Green Revolution. The
latter focused mostly on the popularization of high-yielding crop
varieties to overcome food shortage. In contrast, the Second Green
Revolution will embrace the entire Agro-Economy, from the farmer
to the consumer. It will harness a bouquet of new technologies,
space, IT, BT. It will also focus on water-efficient irrigation systems,
environment-friendly pesticides, precision agriculture, agriculture
markets, food processing, rural infrastructure, etc.

Many of the activities mentioned above are looked after by
different Departments and Ministries. For better coordination, a
Cabinet Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will

Untitled-10 61 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM

62 * Party Document Vol-1

be set up.

 

Untitled-10 62 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM

Rural Development

The Government's main thrust in the coming five years will be to
bridge the rural-urban divide through implementation of the PURA
(Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) program. Under this
program, to be implemented in ten thousand rural clusters across
the country in five years, every cluster will be provided with four
types of connectivities:
(a) physical connectivity, which includes good roads and
power supply;
(b) digital connectivity, which includes modern telecom and
IT services;
(c) knowledge connectivity, which includes good schools and
vocational training centers; and
(d) market connectivity, which includes good market
infrastructure.

Specifically,
* Village electrification will be completed by 2007 through
an accelerated implementation of the program to cover 1
crore households and 1 lakh villages.
¢ All villages will have primary health centers within the
village, dispensaries within five to eight kilometers, and
referral hospitals within twenty kilometers.
PURA will be launched before August 15, 2004.

Rural Sanitation

Lack of safe drinking water and sanitation is the cause of 80%
of all diseases and ailments. 67% of India’s rural population and 22%
of our urban population has no access to toilets. This is a source of

Untitled-10 63 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM

64 * Party Document Vol-1

embarrassment and discontent among the youth, especially young
women. The NDA is committed to changing this sad reality.

The Total Sanitation Campaign, launched by the NDA
Government in 1999, has been a remarkable success. Necessary
funds will be mobilized to ensure that all the TSC projects will
be fully implemented in five years, ensuring that all the 8.4 crore
uncovered rural households will have access to basic sanitation
either their own or community-owned. There shall be no Anganwadi
centre or rural/urban school without water and toilet facilities by
2005. Priority will be given to girls’ schools and schools in tribal
and remote areas.

Drinking water

More than Rs. 40,000 crore have been invested in the rural
water supply sector during the last five decades by the Central
and State Governments. However, the results have not been
commensurate with this investment, primarily because the schemes
did not have an in-built mechanism for people’s participation,
panchayat ownership, and bureaucratic accountability. The
NDA Government removed this shortcoming by launching the
‘Swajaldhara’ program in December 2002. Under this, 90% of
funds on capital cost would be given by the Centre directly
to Panchayats. The remaining 10% of the capital cost and full
Operation and Maintenance (O&M) responsibility will be borne
by the community.

All the existing rural drinking water supply schemes would
be brought under the reforms agenda of ‘Swajaldhara’ — making
them ‘demand-driven’ rather than ‘supply-driven’ to ensure their
long-term sustainability. Adequate funds will be mobilized for its
enlarged implementation with the following commitments:

(a) Every rural habitation in the country, including those
that have slipped back into the Partially Covered or Non-
Covered status, will be provided an assured source of
drinking water supply by 2007;

(b) Acommunity-based program for water quality monitoring
would be initiated;

(c) Water supply departments and nigams of State Governments
would be reformed;

Untitled-10 64 11/7/2016 11:19:07 PM

Election Manifestoes * 65

(d) Panchayats would be given incentives for rainwater
harvesting, raising ground-water levels, and augmentation
and cleaning up of water sources such as village ponds,
wells, rivulets, etc.

Infrastructure

The Connectivity Revolution, which was launched by the NDA
Government, and has already yielded visible results in several
sectors, will be further accelerated. Specifically, our Government
will do the following in the coming five years:

Roads

1. Timely completion of the National Highway
Development Project (nearly 15,000 km): Phase 1 (Golden
Quadrilateral) by 2005; Phase 2 (East-West and North-
South Corridors) by 2008; Pradhan Mantri Bharat Jodo
Pariyojana (additional 10,000 km, linking all those State
capitals not covered by NHDP, as well as important
commercial centers in all the States, to NHDP with 4/6

awareness measures.

‘Sampoorna Sadak Connectivity’

A new program called the ‘Pradhan Mantri Pradesh Sadak
Yojana’ (PMPSY) will be launched to improve all the State Highways
and district roads in the country. These are the weak link in our
road network that includes world-class national highways on
one end and rapidly improving rural roads on the other end. The
blueprint of this program, including its funding and monitoring,
will be prepared after detailed consultation with State Governments.
Reform of State PWDs and participation of the private sector will be
the highlights of this new project. PMPSY will provide the missing
link in the comprehensive road connectivity revolution, to be called
the ‘Sampoorna Sadak Connectivity’ initiative, whose other three
links are already being implemented by our Government namely,
National Highways Development Program (NHDP), Pradhan
Mantri Bharat Jodo Pariyojana (PMBJP), and the Pradhan Mantri
Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY).

Railways
Railways are the lifeline of our nation. They are also the
most important logistical support system for the Indian economy.
Unprecedented expansion and modernization of India’s railway
infrastructure over the next five years will be our commitment.

manner. A Task Force will be set up to work out the modalities of
this program, including innovative ways of financing it.

Power

In 1998, the NDA Government inherited not only an
extremely difficult power situation, but also a defective power
policy and a flawed sector reform program. We took immediate
steps to change the direction of reform and reorient the policies
and programs with a view to setting right the situation. Priority
was given to reforms in distribution by providing Rs. 20,000 crore
for improving the distribution network and another Rs. 20,000
crore for giving SEBs incentives to reduce their losses. By enacting
the Electricity Act, 2003, the NDA Government gave a big push
to power sector reforms. Our future commitments in this critical
sector will be:

1. Elimination of electricity shortages by 2012; significant
reduction by 2009.

2. Atleast 50,000 MW of additional generation capacity will
be created over the next five years. Work on projects with
a combined capacity of 12,000 MW (of which 8,000 MW
in the private sector) will start before the end of 2004.

3. Robust National Grid - 25,000 MW of power transfer
capability by 2009.

4. SEB losses to be reduced to less than Rs. 5,000 crore by
2009 from the current figure of Rs. 24,000 crore.

5. T&D losses shall be significantly reduced.

will be completed before end of 2004.

7. Every consumer of electricity in India, including farmers,
would be connected through digital, tamper-proof meters
in the next three years.

8. Implementation of the 50,000 MW Hydroelectric Initiative.

9. Implementation of the 100,000 MW Thermal Power
Initiative.

10. A major push for harnessing non-conventional energy
sources. A National Program for biomass-based
decentralized power generation in rural areas will be
started.

11. Energy conservation campaign will be intensified by

Untitled-10 72 11/7/2016 11:19:09 PM

Election Manifestoes * 73

promoting energy saving technologies.

We promise that the above tasks, when accomplished, will
create not only a vibrant and healthy power sector, but the country
will experience the benefit of power sector reforms, in the same
manner as is being experienced in the Telecom Sector.

500’ companies have a sizeable part of their R&D facility
located in India.

7. The NDA Government is proud that a reversal of ‘brain
drain’ —‘brain gain’ has started in recent years, for the first
time in Independent India. We will convert this ‘trickle’
into a‘torrent’ by creating attractive conditions for the best
Indian talent abroad to return to India or to participate
in collaborative work. We will also encourage foreign
scientists and professionals to come and work here in big
numbers. The time has come to declare India as the land
of opportunity for top-order talent in diverse fields.

Untitled-10 79 11/7/2016 11:19:10 PM

Trade & Commerce

1. Big changes have come about in the global trade
environment in the past decade or so. Simultaneously,
India’s ambition to become a major player in global trade is
being matched by growing domestic capability. In response
to these two trends, a separate Ministry for International
Trade will be created to deal with the challenges and to
capture opportunities in global trade in a focused way.

2. Special Economic Zones will be promoted as vehicles for
overall growth. An SEZ Promotion Council, with wide
industry participation, will be created in the Ministry of
Commerce as an apex body.

growth and thereby reducing poverty and economic
inequalities. Internal trade barriers hamper growth. They
will be identified and removed.

6. EXIM Bank’s capital base will be strengthened to enable
it to lend more to exporters.

‘Behtar Bazaar Plan’

Bazaar has always been at the center of India’s social life and
played a crucial role in driving the economy. Removing inefficiencies
in our markets from the village haat to wholesale markets in cities
and introducing new efficiencies into them will be our priority. The
Centre will work closely with State Governments on a time-bound
plan of action, to be called ‘Behtar Bazaar Action Plan’, which will
include the following initiatives:

(a) Every city and tehsil town in the country will draw

up its own ‘Behtar Bazaar Action Plans’, with people’s
participation, identifying problems and solutions thereof.

Untitled-10 81 11/7/2016 11:19:10 PM

82 * Party Document Vol-1

(b) Strengthening the connectivity to markets and provision
of adequate infrastructure facilities power, water, telecom
and IT services, parking lots, etc. and redevelopment/
relocation where necessary, will be at the core of these
action plans.

(c) HUDCO and commercial banks will be encouraged to fund
this initiative, to be implemented through public-private
partnerships. For markets that mainly support agriculture
and the rural economy, this will be considered priority
sector lending.

(d) Traditional trading communities in Indian society, who
have a wealth of knowledge and experience in this field,
will be suitably encouraged.

Globalization

1. The NDA Government will continue to defend India’s
interests, especially the interests of our kisans, at the
World Trade Organization. Along with other developing
countries, we shall work towards restraining developed
nations from securing unfair advantages in global trade,
investments, agriculture, and services.

2. The NDA Government will prepare India to take advantage
of the big shift that is currently taking place in the global
economy. This shift favors a low-cost economy like India’s,
which has developed sufficient competitive strengths in
cost, quality and technology, over high-cost economies
in manufacturing and services. Our Government will
enlarge these strengths by further reforming our economy,
modernizing our infrastructure, enriching India’s human
resources, and augmenting our capabilities in science and
technology.

Housing
The NDA Government remains committed to the goal of
‘Housing for All by 2010’.

1. Encouraged by the success of our program to facilitate
construction of twenty lakh additional houses each year,
we propose to raise the target to thirty lakh each year. The
additional one million houses will be meant exclusively

Untitled-10 82 11/7/2016 11:19:10 PM

Election Manifestoes * 83

for weaker sections of society.

2. Banks will be encouraged to extend housing loans with
low interest rates to rural populations.

3. Anew national program will be launched to enable people
with kutcha houses in rural areas to upgrade them into
pucca houses.

housing projects for the poor and middle classes.

5. States will be encouraged to repeal the Urban Land Ceiling
Act, amend the Rent Control Act, and reduce stamp duty
on property transactions and lease agreements.

6. The stock of rented houses will be vastly increased and
renting a house will be made easier by providing a strong,
but simple legal framework that protects the interests of
both landlords and tenants.

7. Incentives will be given for investments in repairing
dilapidated buildings.

Urban Renewal

The Government will launch a major national program for
slum improvement and rehabilitation, based on a progressive
national policy that harmonizes the basic living and livelihood
rights of the urban poor with the imperative of planned urban
development. Towards this end, the Valmiki Ambedkar Aawas
Yojana (VAMBAY), which has met with enthusiastic response,
will be redesigned and its scope will be widened to cover integral
development of slum habitations. Innovative ways will be evolved
for raising finances, maximizing people’s participation, and
strengthening the commitment of municipal bodies for the success
of this initiative. The long-term aim of this initiative is to make
Indian cities slum-free by 2020.

1. Municipal governance will be strengthened.

2. A model central law will be enacted to stop illegal
encroachments. States will be encouraged to pass similar
legislation.

3. HUDCO’s lending for urban renewal projects will be
further enhanced. Municipal bodies will be enabled to raise
resources from the bond market for their urban renewable
needs.

4. The size of the City Challenge Fund will be raised from
the present Rs. 500 crore.

5. Atleast ten Indian cities will be developed as Global Cities,
with world-class airports, efficient mass transportation
systems, high quality of social infrastructure, vibrant
cultural life and a dynamic environment for economic
growth with strong global linkages.

6. The infrastructure and other urban renewal needs of
Mumbai, the country’s commercial capital, will be
addressed.

7. We recognize that municipal bodies have become the
weakest link in our system of governance. Also, the
problems and needs of big cities have become too complex
to be handled in old ways. Therefore, the NDA proposes
to elevate municipal corporations in the ten proposed
Global Cities to the level of City Governments, within their
respective States. These would be vested with requisite
financial, judicial, planning, and law-enforcement powers.
After evolving a political consensus on this issue, necessary
legislative and administrative changes will be introduced.

8. At least twenty new cities and satellite towns will be
developed on completely futuristic lines.

9. An Urban Road Development Fund on the lines of the
fund for NHDP will be set up. This will fund two hundred
flyovers a year in smaller cities and big towns, as well as
pedestrian subways and widening of roads.

10. We shall create a state-facilitated, but privately funded
and implemented program of urban mass housing for
lower and middle classes.

11. The ‘Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan’ program will be redesigned
with enlarged scope and enhanced resources to make our
cities cleaner. It will be turned into a people’s campaign with
strong government support at all levels. Adequate number
of community toilets, ran on the pay-and-use principle,
will be constructed within three years in every city.
Efficient collection and productive utilization of garbage
will be made mandatory. Cities and neighbourhoods that
demonstrate success stories will be suitably recognized.

Informal Sector

A National Policy for promotion of the Informal Sector will
be unveiled before the end of 2004. It will provide livelihood
protection to millions of people engaged in this sector, by freeing
them from the scourge of extortion and harassment. Legal
recognition will be accorded to entrepreneurs and self-employed
people in the informal sector and their assets, so that they can
enter into contracts, avail bank loans, benefit from various
government schemes, and get better market access for their
products and services. These and other measures will help them
thrive in their myriad occupations, and create more employment
opportunities.

Self-help Groups

Self-Help Groups in India are already a big success story.
Over 15 lakh SHGs have been formed so far, providing bank-
supported micro-finance to their members. Women’s SHGs,
under the ‘Swashakti’ program, have been particularly successful
in increasing family incomes of the rural and urban poor and in
advancing the cause of women’s economic empowerment. They
also have the best record in repaying bank loans.

Building on the experience so far, our Government will
prepare an action plan to promote SHGs as a people’s movement
for participatory economic development. Innovative partnerships
between SHGs, NGOs, banks, and markets will created. The private
sector will be involved in a big way. Special incentives will be
provided for women’s SHGs to be formed in every neighborhood.
This is possible in a wide variety of occupations such as SHGs
of handloom weavers that enable them to access yarn, improve
designs, and bypass market intermediaries to get better value for
their products; or women’s marketing co-operatives in vegetables,
fish and other agro-products. Northern States, and in other areas
where SHGs are still weak and fewer in number, will be specially
targeted.

We will give a formal, legal framework to SHGs. A suitable
law, enabling micro-credit operations and nurturing them to be
scaled up, will be enacted.

Tourism

An action plan will be prepared within the first six months
for developing India as a major tourism destination in the world.
One of its important milestones would be to increase foreign tourist
arrivals from 30 lakh now to 1 crore by 2009, and 2 crore tourists
by 2015. Its other features would be:

1. A strategic marketing plan (such as the ‘Incredible India!’
campaign) with adequate funding will be implemented
to achieve a strong India tourism brand.

2. Higher earnings from tourism from US $3 billion at present
to US $10 billion by 2009.

3. Creation of 1 crore additional employment by 2009, and
2.5 crore by 2015, based on the multiplier effect of tourism
on various economic activities.

4. Establishment of five world-class Indian Institutes of Travel
and Tourism on the lines of IIMs, with private investment.

5. Visa on arrival; common tourist visa for SAARC countries;
simplify visa requirements; reduce visa fees and grant
visas within 24 hours.

6. Integrated development of India’s 6,000 km-long coastline
through cruise and beach tourism.

7. The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) provisions will be
relaxed for tourism and critical urban development projects.

8. Rationalization and simplification of taxes; Tax holidays
on large capital investments in tourism.

9. Creation of at least two world-class theme parks based on
India’s civilizational and spiritual heritage.

10. The North-East will be promoted in a special way to create
new tourism destinations for foreign tourists.

Domestic Tourism

A similar focused approach will be adopted for promoting
domestic tourism. Every district will be encouraged to prepare a
District Tourism Development Plan, harnessing its own unique
attractions, setting targets, and offering good infrastructure and
affordable amenities. A new thrust will be given to developing
adventure tourism and rural tourism. A Pilgrimage Tourism
Development Fund will be created to improve infrastructure,
amenities, and cleanliness standards at 100 important centers of

Untitled-10 86 11/7/2016 11:19:11 PM

Election Manifestoes * 87

pilgrimage across the country in five years. Substantial contribution
to the fund will come from pilgrims themselves, through a user
charge mechanism.

Media and Entertainment

1. The entertainment industry occupies an important place
in the cultural and social life of our nation. Its size, reach,
recognition, and influence have grown remarkably in
recent decades — both nationally and internationally. The
decisions taken by our Government have greatly helped
India’s film and TV industry in recent years. Both have a
huge potential for further growth, including in the area
of employment generation. A National Policy for India’s
Entertainment Industry will be prepared, within six months,
to realize its growth potential.

2. A broad-based committee will be set up to formulate a
National Media Policy that would comprehensively address
all the complex issues that have emerged in recent years.

Labour

1. The NDA Government has recently unveiled a progressive
social security scheme for 37 crore people in the unorganized
sector, the first of its kind since Independence. Its speedy
and effective implementation will be our priority.

2. We recognize that in a labor-rich society like India, our
strategy for achieving 8 to 10% GDP growth rate will
have to rest primarily on boosting labor productivity.
Therefore, a nationwide program will be launched to
raise labor productivity by increasing the percentage of
trained manpower in India’s workforce from less than
10% at present to at least 50% by 2020 with five-yearly
milestones.

3. The working of Employees State Insurance Corporation
(ESIC) will be reviewed and necessary steps will be taken
for its improvement.

4. Recommendations of the Second Labor Commission will
be implemented with necessary modifications to further
strengthen welfare, training, and employment creation
provisions.

Environment Protection

The NDA views the depletion of India’s precious environmental
assets with great concern. We believe that sustainable development
is possible with the effective protection of all our environmental
assets.

1. Building on the recent achievement in increasing India’s
forest cover, further measures will be taken to promote
afforestation, social forestry and agro forestry. States where
depletion has reached critical levels will receive greater
attention. Joint Forest Management, which institutionalizes
community partnership, will be further strengthened.

2. Vehicular pollution will be controlled by stringent standards
on all motor vehicles at the manufacturing stage itself and
by promoting the use of clean fuels.

3. Environment impact assessment of development projects
and industrial clusters will be strengthened.

4. Development of ‘Green’ technologies will be further
encouraged.

5. Regulation of pollution control norms will be decentralized
to States and local self-government bodies so that the
people suffering from pollution have a say in the mitigation
process.

Employment Generation

The NDA is committed to the goal of eradicating unemployment.
Our Government will continue to follow a strategy of accelerated
economic growth, which is capable of generating gainful employment
for all those who can work. An essential aspect of this strategy is
the recognition that the nature of employment generation in India,
in line with trends in many other countries, has changed with
the changing nature of our economy. Employment generation in
government offices and in the capital-intensive segment of industry
has a reduced role in this strategy. However, employment and
self-employment opportunities are coming up on a large scale in
services and in the unorganized sector whose relative weightage
in the Indian economy is steadily growing.

This new trend of employment generation is already visible
in many parts of India. Many young people are finding jobs and
self-employment in different service sectors in not just big cities but
also in small towns. These are not jobs in the traditional sense, but
they offer opportunities and new challenges for personal growth.
Our Government will fully support this trend through necessary
policy and institutional measures, including through provision of
social security to people in the unorganized sector.

In the NDA’s common manifesto in 1999, we had promised
to create one crore additional employment and self-employment
opportunities each year. This commitment shall continue. We will
follow a three-pronged strategy to fulfill this promise:

(a) Sustaining a high GDP growth rate of 8 to 10% yearly; a
fast growing economy will create more employment and
self-employment opportunities;

Raising the employment-elasticity of the economy by
focusing the growth in the employment-generating sectors
of the economy;

(c) Enlarging the scope of government schemes that create
employment, such as the food-for-work Sampoorna
Grameen Rozgar Yojana. Such schemes will receive greater
budgetary support in 100 backward districts.

As has been indicated in this document, our Government

will continue to promote many initiatives that have considerable

(b

eS

Untitled-10 89 11/7/2016 11:19:12 PM

potential for employment generation for different sections of our
society. In rural areas these are: agriculture and agro-processing,
wasteland development, agro-forestry, social forestry, dairy, poultry,
animal husbandry, agriculture extension services, cottage industries,
self-help groups, housing and road construction, transportation, etc.

In urban areas, we will promote employment, self-employment
and entrepreneurship opportunities in retail trade, housing and
construction, food, transportation, tourism, services in the informal
sector, telecom and IT, manufacturing, garments, entertainment,
financial services, education and training, etc.

Enhancing the employability of employment-seeking youth,
in line with the changing needs and opportunities in the economy
will be made a priority. Employment is fundamentally linked with
education. Therefore, we have affirmed our commitment to carry out
a major overhaul of our school and college education. Training in
skills will begin in secondary schools. When a student matriculates,
she/he will have acquired some job-oriented skills. The University
Grants Commission is redesigning college curriculum to enable
students to have greater flexibility in the choice of subjects and
pursue multiple job-oriented diploma courses simultaneously.
Colleges will be encouraged to offer —singly or collaboratively —a
variety of subjects and courses in areas that need skilled manpower.

There are as many as 2,800 diverse trades in India, each
requiring a sound domain knowledge and good skills. Knowledge
and skills in these can be upgraded in a scalable fashion through
IT-based distance learning, television, and broadband internet
connectivity. Our Government will promote these new technologies
in affordable ways. We will encourage creation of educational
content in local languages to be used on these platforms. We will
also promote new well-regulated certification mechanisms. We will

Untitled-10 90 11/7/2016 11:19:12 PM

Election Manifestoes * 91

give incentives to the private sector to participate in job-oriented
education and training in a big way — both in urban as well as in rural
areas. There would be no age barriers to admissions for pursuing
these courses. We are confident that all these new initiatives would
touch the lives of millions of our young women and men, raise their
skills and productivity, provide them with fulfilling employment
opportunities and improve the quality of products and services in
India beyond recognition.

Balanced Development

1. A Monitoring Committee for Elimination of Regional
Disparities will be set up to focus on developmental

Minorities

1. A Minorities Development Agenda will be unveiled within
the first six months to focus on a 3-E program: Education,
Economic upliftment, and Empowerment.

2. The Agenda will especially address the needs of those
belonging to poor and backward families, ensuring that
they get an equitable share in government-supported
schemes in education, housing, etc.

3. The working of the Minorities Commission will be
reoriented to address their developmental and welfare
issues.

insurance, foreign investment, and capital markets will be
completed within the next six months.

2. The principal aim of reforms in the banking sector will

Social Development

Our goal in Social Development will be to bring about all-sided
improvement in the quality of life of all Indians by fulfilling the
basic needs of every citizen in education, healthcare, nutrition,
drinking water, housing, sanitation, and cultural development.

To achieve this overarching objective, and to reverse the
previous trend of inadequate investment in this sector, the
Government will create a special ‘Social Development Fund’ of
Rs. 100,000 crore to be invested over five years.

Education for All

1. Total spending on education will be raised to 6% of the
GDP in five years, with enlarged public-private partnership
at every level of the educational pyramid.

2. Literacy rate of 85% will be achieved in five years. Our
vision is to see that Indian society becomes fully literate by
2015. For this, we will launch a multi-pronged campaign
to ensure that every child goes to school, every school is
made accountable to the community, and every village
and town is made accountable for its quality education
status. Appropriate resources both from Government and
non-government sources will be mobilized to match our
ambitious goals. Innovative tools like computer-based
and TV-promoted functional literacy will be employed.
The ‘Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’ will be made into a people’s
movement.

3. Spread of education among SCs, STs, OBCs, and minorities,
and activities aimed at removing gender disparities in
education at all levels, will receive increased support.

4. A special fund of Rs. 1,000 crore a year will be created,
partially through a cess on all non-needy students, to
improve all primary school buildings in rural areas in five
years.

5. ‘Akshaya Patra’, as a national mid-day meal program, will
be made operational.

overhauled and made employment-oriented. Opportunities

Untitled-10 95 11/7/2016 11:19:13 PM

for skill development and vocational training will be
maximized.

7. A Standards Improvement Campaign, to be named after
Dr. Syama Prasad Mookherjee (who became the youngest
ever vice-chancellor of the prestigious Calcutta University),
will be launched to raise the quality of education in colleges
and universities. Institutions that perform well will be
suitably recognized.

8. No student would be deprived of access to higher education
for lack of resources. Scholarships and soft loans would be
made widely available to all needy students. A National
Education Development Fund will be established for this
purpose.

9. While encouraging private investment, effective steps will
be taken to curb commercialization of education.

10. The focus on Indian culture, heritage, and ethical values
in syllabi will be strengthened. Character-building and
all-round development of the student's personality will be
emphasized. Sports, physical training, and social service
will be mainstreamed into the educational system.

11. The growing de-emphasis of Bharatiya languages in school

the world.

16. Five new IITs will be established before 2005.

17. Our vision is to make India a global hub for higher
education and regain the glory of the Nalanda era. For
this, an action plan will be prepared to elevate at least
25 Indian universities and 100 colleges to international
standards in every respect. All our IITs, NITs, IIMs, IScs,
AIIMS-like medical institutes, and other reputed higher
educational institutions (both existing and proposed) will
be further supported. Public-private participation will be
fully activated to realize the above vision, which would
not only raise India’s stature globally but also enable our
country to earn significant foreign exchange.

Health for All

For the NDA, ‘Health For All’ is not a mere slogan. It is our
avowed objective, a cherished goal; indeed, a commitment to our
people, which we will strive to fulfill. Access to affordable healthcare
is a basic need, which must be provided for.

1. Total public spending on healthcare at present is 2% of the
GDP. This figure will be doubled in the next five years.
Our Government has already taken an important step in
this direction by setting up the National Commission on
Macroeconomics and Health, which is co-chaired by the
Finance Minister and the Minister of Health and Family
Welfare. Investment by the private sector, including by
NRIs, for providing healthcare in India will be encouraged.
Public-private partnerships will be enhanced.

2. We will implement in a time-bound manner the Pradhan
Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana under which six new
hospitals on the pattern of All India Institute of Medical
Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi are being set up in six under-
served states and six existing hospitals in other states are
being upgraded to the level of AIIMS. This is a part of
our commitment to provide affordable super-specialty
healthcare to the needy in different parts of the country,
within or near their own states.

3. An insurance-based health security scheme, called

Untitled-10 97 11/7/2016 11:19:13 PM

98 * Party Document Vol-1

Antyodaya Swasthya Yojana, will be started to cover two
crore poorest among the BPL families, who are currently
beneficiaries of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana.

4. We will strive towards zero incidence of polio by the end
of 2004 and for keeping this zero status for the next three
years, so that India can be certified polio free by 2007.

5. The National TB Control Program will cover the entire
population by the end of next year. Sufficient funds will
be allocated for this purpose.

6. All efforts will be made for the eradication of filariasis
within five years.

7. We will revitalize the existing Primary Healthcare system in
coordination with the state governments. Linkages between
safe drinking water, sanitation, nutrition, family welfare
services, women and child services, and primary education
will be strengthened through appropriate coordination
mechanisms at the Central, State, and village levels.

8. The Government will set up a Rs. 1,000 crore fund, through
public-private partnerships, to improve the infrastructure
of primary healthcare centers in backward areas.

9. Infant and maternal mortality levels will be reduced by
half. The newly launched ‘Vande Mataram’ scheme of
gynecologists in private practice for care of pregnant
women will be strengthened. The ‘Janani Suraksha
Yojana,’ already envisaged by us, will be implemented
with the aim of establishing linkages between a health
center and the mother-to-be. To meet the expectation of
the nutrition of the mother, a sum of Rs. 500 will be given
to her after the birth of a baby boy and Rs. 1,000 for a
baby girl.

10. The ‘Save the Girl Child’ campaign will be further
popularized.

11. The spread of HIV/AIDS will be checked on a war
footing. Care and support for AIDS patients will be
undertaken hand-in-hand with efforts for the prevention
of the disease.

12. We are committed towards strengthening the National
Programs on malaria, blindness, leprosy, and mental
health.

Untitled-10 98 11/7/2016 11:19:13 PM

Election Manifestoes * 99

13. The ageing population needs special care. The government
hospitals will have special facilities for healthcare of senior
citizens.

14. We will promote our traditional systems of medicine,
namely Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Yoga, and Naturopathy,
as also homeopathy. Different systems will be synergized
in the delivery of healthcare and in medical education.

15. We will encourage the production and exports of
pharmaceutical products from India, including Ayurvedic
and herbal products.

16. The nearly six lakh providers of traditional medical services
in villages have remained unrecognized and unsupported,
in spite of catering to the needs of those sections of our
population, which are underserved by the formal system.
They will be suitably assisted to play a bigger and more
effective role in improving the health profile of the rural
poor.

17. Working of regulatory bodies, which oversee medical
education in the country, will be reviewed to improve
standards.

18. We shall make India a preferred global destination for
healthcare. Our large reservoirs of skilled doctors, nurses,
and other paramedical staff along with the state-of-
the-art facilities in our hospitals have a huge potential,
which will be nurtured and realized in the next five
years. Simultaneously, steps will be taken to improve the
standards of excellence in medical education, nursing, and
other areas. An Action Plan will be drawn up before end
of 2004 to pursue this goal, with suitable encouragement
to the private sector.

19. The menace of spurious drugs shall be done away with.

20. Amass movement will be launched for increasing awareness
about health issues and making citizens take good care
of themselves by cultivating healthy habits and lifestyles;
towards this end, a strong physical and sports culture will
be promoted among people of all age-groups.

Food Security
1. Coverage of the ‘Antyodaya Anna Yojana’ (which provides
wheat at Rs. 2a kg and rice at Rs. 3. a kg) will be increased

Untitled-10 99 11/7/2016 11:19:14 PM

100 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

from 2 crore to 5 crore poorest families in five years. Its
implementation will be decentralized.

2. All beneficiaries under this scheme will be given an
‘Antyodaya Card’ that would also entitle them to Health
Security, Social Security, Shelter Security, Educational
Guarantee, and priority attention in government offices
and police stations.

3. A well-run supply chain involving the private traders,
community, and Panchayats will be established to ensure
food availability in normal times as well as during natural
calamities.

4. The public distribution system would be revamped with
people’s participation to make it efficient and accountable.
It would also be used to deliver other goods and services.

Women’s Empowerment

1. A National Policy on Women’s Economic Empowerment
will be unveiled before end of 2004. It will aim at ensuring
that every woman has some means of livelihood and,
additionally, at enhancing the incomes of all categories
of working women. It will propose strategies to enable
women in balancing work and family by introducing a
national childcare plan, workplace flexibility, greater career
opportunities, hostels for working women in every town,
and removal of gender disparities in education, wages,
and property rights.

2. Support for programs like ‘Swavalamban’ and STEP
(Support to Training and Employment Program for Women),
which promote self-employment and entrepreneurship for
needy women, will be greatly enhanced. Technical and
management services for those engaged in handicrafts, food
processing, handloom, garments, etc., will be strengthened.
Added focus will be provided for implementing these
programs in the North East, J&K, and areas affected by
left-wing extremism.

3. Enterprises promoted by women, or employing a large
number of women, will be given ‘fast track’ facilitation.

4. Laws to check female foeticide, dowry, child marriage,
trafficking, rape and family violence will be strictly

Untitled-10 100 11/7/2016 11:19:14 PM

Election Manifestoes * 101

enforced. Societal efforts to curb these ills will be
encouraged.

5. Support for the Swadhaar program and Women Helplines
for abandoned widows, victims of trafficking, mentally
challenged women, and victims of calamities will be greatly
expanded with private and philanthropic participation.

6. The Bill for 33% reservation for women in Parliament and
State Legislatures will be introduced in the very first session
of Parliament. The NDA will work for speedy passage of
this progressive legislation based on a consensus.

Care of the Disabled
Disabled people constitute about 5% of India’s population.
Years of neglect have delayed their large-scale integration into the
social mainstream. Their welfare and rehabilitation is integral to
our vision of a caring society and a responsive government. The
newly-established Commission for the Disabled will draw up a
Charter for the Disabled, which will have the following points:
1. Ensure and implement the right for education and
vocational training for the disabled.
2. Ensure disabled-friendly access to public utilities, public
buildings, and transport.
3. Ensure maximum economic independence of the disabled by
creating more income generation models for the disabled.
4. Facilitate establishment of an Institute of Vocational
Training for the Disabled in every district with public-
private partnership.
5. Provide special incentive for the adoption of a disabled
child.
6. Voluntary organizations working for the care of the disabled
will be fully supported.
Children
The NDA is committed to securing a bright future for India’s
children. A National Commission for Children will be set up to
comprehensively address the issues of education, healthcare,
nutrition, recreation, removal of gender disparities, elimination
of child labor, integrated care and rehabilitation of orphans and
street children, etc. It will put the aspirations and rights of children
at the heart of our development agenda.

The Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), the world’s
largest early childcare programme, will be further strengthened.
Its implementation will be communitised.

Youth

India, an ancient civilization, has become a young nation
demographically. 65% of our population is below 35 years. These
young men and women have soaring aspirations for themselves
and a burning desire to see India emerge as a strong and prosperous
country. The NDA commits itself to helping our youth realize their
dreams.

1. We shall strive for ‘Education for All’ and ‘Employment
for All’.

2. We shall strive to create an environment in which young
Indians find many avenues to contribute to nation-building
and to their own all-round development.

3. The National Cadet Corps shall be strengthened. The
National Service Scheme shall be made more innovative
to nurture the spirit of voluntary service among the youth.
Encouragement for talented youth in arts and other cultural
pursuits will be stepped up.

4. We will promote the Youth Hostel movement by facilitating
the construction of new youth hostels in major cities and
tourist centers, with private sector participation.

5. Recommendations of the National Youth Commission will
be given serious consideration.

Sports
The NDA Government aims to make India a major sports
power in the world.

1. Towards this end, the Prime Minister’s Ten-Point
Program for the Development of Sports will be vigorously
implemented.

2. A National Sports Development Fund will be set up with
a yearly allocation of Rs. 500 crore. Citizens and business
houses will be encouraged to contribute to it.

3. A Rashtriya Khel Rozgar Yojana will be launched to
encourage talented sportspersons to set up sports clubs,
gymnasiums, and training centres, thereby creating

Untitled-10 102 11/7/2016 11:19:14 PM

Election Manifestoes * 103

employment and self-employment opportunities.
4. Greater support will be provided for the promotion of
traditional Indian sports and rural transport.

Senior Citizens

Respect for elders has always been at the center of India’s
social traditions and cultural ethos. Being repositories of knowledge
and experience, they are a precious asset to society. However, they
have been facing many problems with rapid urbanization and
changes in the traditional joint families. Our Government will set
up a National Commission for Senior Citizens to comprehensively
address their needs, problems and potential to further contribute
to the nation’s development.

Population Control

1. A people’s movement will be launched to realize the goals
and targets set in the National Population Policy. It will
particularly focus on those States that are lagging behind.

2. The Government will introduce a set of non-coercive
disincentives for a two-child norm, and incentives for a
girl child. The two-child norm will be made a qualification,
on a prospective basis, for contesting any election.

transparent manner.

2. The number of courts and the number of judges will be
doubled in five years for quicker judicial process.

3. A separate class of courts will be set up for cases involving
specified commercial laws such as the Contract Act,
Negotiable Instruments Act, and other business laws. These

Centre-State Relations

The NDA Government's achievement in this regard can be
judged by the fact that Centre-State relations are no longer a subject
of political debate. They are marked by harmony and cooperation,
which were sadly missing in previous decades. Our Government
has not discriminated against any State on political grounds. This
shall continue to be our approach in the coming five years. On
the issue of Article 356 of the Constitution, we remain committed
to the consensus reached at the Inter-State Council meeting in
Srinagar in 2003.

Empowerment of Panchayats

1. The NDA Government will work for effective financial
and administrative empowerment of Panchayati Raj
Institutions and Urban Local Bodies in respect of three Fs:
‘Funds’, ‘Functions’, and ‘Functionaries’. Suitable judicial,
executive, financial, and geographical layout planning
powers will be devolved to these bodies. The Constitution
would be amended for this purpose.

2. The institution of the Gram Sabha will be strengthened to
discuss every developmental work, scrutinize the allocation
and spending of funds, and evaluate the performance of
panchayat and government functionaries.

Cultural and Spiritual Heritage

1. Ours was the first government to launch national missions
for the preservation of manuscripts, monuments, and other
facets of India’s cultural, artistic and spiritual heritage.
States will be encouraged to set up similar missions.
Every town will prepare a heritage conservation mission.
These will be effectively implemented, with extensive
participation of communities, business houses, professional
bodies, and NGOs.

2. Support for expanding India’s cultural relations with all
countries in the world will be considerably enhanced, with
private participation.

3. A National Commission for promotion of Bharatiya
languages will be established. It will make a comprehensive
study of the challenges before our Bharatiya languages in

Untitled-10 107 11/7/2016 11:19:15 PM

108 * Party Document Vol-1

the modern era and recommend tasks for their consistent
development.
4. Upkeep of places of spiritual importance.

Civil Society Empowerment

1. The NDA recognizes that maximizing people’s participation

in the implementation of all policies and programs of

the government is the key to India’s rapid and all-round

development. Towards this end, a National Council of

Voluntary Organizations will be set up. States will be
encouraged to establish similar Councils.

2. Involvement of religious establishments of all denominations,
which are active in the social field, will be encouraged in
areas like mass-feeding for the poor, care of orphans
and destitutes, campaign against social evils like female
foeticide, environmental protection, etc.

3. Civil Society will be suitably empowered to help in
achieving dispute resolution ranging from local disputes
over minor issues to major ones over contentious issues
outside the realm of the judiciary and government. Its
cooperation will be sought in strengthening civic discipline,
adherence to law, tax compliance, and care for public
property.

National Security

The NDA Government took historic initiatives in the last six
years to strengthen India’s defense capability and preparedness.
We pledge to carry forward this imperative. Our priorities will be:

1. Speedy implementation of all the current programs for
modernization, acquisition, and capability enhancement;

2. Making operational the Rs. 25,000-crore Defense
Modernization Fund, which was announced in the Interim
Budget;

3. Minimizing delays and procedural bottlenecks, which
push up costs and cause obsolescence;

4. Achieving greater efficiency in defense spending; giving
a further boost to indigenization of defense production
and encouragement to private sector participation; and
making defense exports a thrust area.

5. In addition, the Government will continue to further
augment welfare measures for ex-servicemen and war
widows. We shall create adequate opportunities for retired
officers to contribute to development activities where
they can put their skills and training to productive use.
Necessary measures will be taken to make service in the
Armed Forces an attractive career option for the educated
Indian youth.

Internal Security

1. Cross-border terrorism will be eliminated.

paramilitary forces will be intensified.

4. We will build political consensus to enact a Central law,
and constitute a federal agency to deal with federal

effectively implemented. The Government will encourage
the misguided youth who have joined various naxal
organizations to give up the path of violence. Development
activities in affected areas will be intensified, with people’s
participation.

6. The long pending police reforms will be taken up to
synchronize with the ongoing scheme for modernization
of state police forces. Investigation functions would be
separated from law & order functions. Number of police
stations will be doubled over the next five years. Mobile
police stations, better communications, community friendly
approach, highway police stations, better public interface
and independence of police will be established through
necessary legal and executive means. Partnership between
police and community will be institutionalized. Police
and security forces will be made more people-friendly,
and more sensitive towards the grievances of the poor,
weaker sections of society, and women.

Jammu & Kashmir

Building on the positive turnaround in the situation in Jammu
& Kashmir, the NDA Government will continue its efforts to
eliminate terrorism and further strengthen the Centre’s cooperation
with the State government to consolidate peace, normalcy and
development in the State.

Together with the State Government, efforts will be made to
ensure early return of Kashmiri Pandits and other displaced people
to their native places.

The NDA Government will work for balanced development of
all the three regions of the State — Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.

Untitled-10 110 11/7/2016 11:19:15 PM

Election Manifestoes * 111

To ensure this, steps will be taken, based on consensus, for:
1. Autonomous Regional Councils for Jammu and Ladakh
with adequate financial and administrative powers;
2. Protection of the original demographic identity of the
three regions.
3. Equitable distribution of funds from the Centre.

North-East

The NDA Government has given unprecedented attention to
the development of the North-Eastern States in the last five years.
These gains will be consolidated and placed on a stable footing.

should be accepted by all. At the same time, efforts should
be intensified for dialogue and a negotiated settlement in
an atmosphere of mutual trust and goodwill.

India and the World

India’s aim in foreign policy has always been to secure for
itself a steadily broadening role in international affairs, so that we
can contribute meaningfully to the global community’s collective

NDA Government is proud of its foreign policy achievements in
the last five years. We will build on these successes to focus on the
following objectives in the coming five years.

1. Continue the dialogue process with Pakistan for a lasting

solution to all the outstanding issues, including Jammu
& Kashmir, on the basis of the Joint Statement issued in
Islamabad in February 2004.

India-ASEAN relationship; initiate the BIMST-EC process;
activate the Mekong-Ganga cooperation initiative; deepen
our economic cooperation with Koreas; and enrich our
strategic partnership with Japan.

4. Further consolidate our strategic partnership with Russia,
with a stronger underpinning of economic cooperation.

the dialogue process with China to achieve a mutually
satisfactory resolution of the boundary issue, which is an
objective of strategic interest for us.

7. Intensify our cooperation with the European Union.

8. Rejuvenate our traditional bonds with countries in West
Asia;

9. Reestablish our age-old ties with countries in Central Asia;

10. Develop extensive relations with all countries in Africa,

Central America, Latin America, and Pacific Ocean
countries like Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, etc.

Energy security will continue to be a key objective of our

Untitled-10 113 11/7/2016 11:19:16 PM

foreign policy. Therefore, we will intensify our efforts to establish
suitable alliances to secure access to new energy sources around
the world.

The NDA Government envisions a future that rests on a
cooperative multipolar world order, with India as one of the poles.

We will continue our efforts to secure permanent membership
of the UN Security Council.

The NDA is proud of the shining achievements of NRIs and
PIOs around the world. We attach great strategic importance to
strengthening India’s multi-dimensional links with the Diaspora
Community. Our Government took many historic initiatives in this
direction in the last five years for example, granting dual citizenship
to PIOs from a select group of countries. Our commitment to this
deeply cherished cause will continue.

Conclusion

IN our common Agenda for elections in 1999, we had said, ‘The
NDA came into being because of an historic need and realization
amongst us that our young democracy cannot bear the fits and
tremors of frequent elections, which will undermine the people’s
faith in the democratic process.’ That phase of instability is now
history. The NDA has taken India into a new orbit of accelerated
development, coupled with peace on our borders and harmony
within.

As we seek a renewed and bigger mandate in 2004, we ask to
be judged by our performance in the last five years as well as by
the vision and programme that we have laid out in this Agenda.
We are proud to have raised the bar of performance higher, and
are keenly aware that the Indian voter now expects more.

We believe in the principle of accountability. We promise to
give a six-monthly report on the status of implementation of the
commitments made in this Agenda.

Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has placed an
energizing vision of India as a Developed Nation. The NDA
rededicates itself to realizing this vision in partnership with the
people of India.

Introduction

THE 1999 General Election is an unnecessary imposition. It was
thrust upon the country by a motley combination that put political
negativism, narrow personal interests and greed for power far
above the national good. The Government led by Shri Atal Bihari
Vajpayee lost the vote in the Lok Sabha on April 17 by just one and
that too questionable vote. In spite of promising a new government
‘in five minutes’ and futilely attempting widespread defections,
this negative coalition by the Congress failed to come up with
any alternative arrangement, forcing the dissolution of the Lok
Sabha and fresh elections. A serving, performing Government was
needlessly destabilised.

Hardly had the country absorbed the shock of this avoidable
uncertainty, then we were faced by Pakistani armed intrusion into
Kargil.

The Government rose to the challenge and acted decisively.
Faced by this aggression in Kargil, the response of the Government
was swift, though measured.

The last of the Pakistani intruders were cleared from the Kargil
Sector on 27th July.

We salute the heroism, dedication and selflessness of our armed
forces. We dedicate ourselves anew to preserving the honour and
territorial integrity of our motherland. We reiterate our commitment
to look after the welfare of the armed forces, and of the dependents
of all those that laid down their lives in service of our motherland.

The security of the nation is our paramount duty. In fulfillment
of this sacred duty we will ensure that the neglect of defence
preparedness by the previous governments during the last decade
shall be corrected. The defence of India and the needs of our armed

Untitled-10 119 11/7/2016 11:19:17 PM

120 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

forces is our commitment.

This General Election allows the country a great opportunity of
finally putting an end to the era of political negativism, uncertainty
and dynasticism. In this hour of national challenge, when the faith
of the people in democratic institutions is under test it is vital that
all nationalist forces join hands. This is the moment to look ahead,
to a new, resurgent India.

In Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the country has a leader
who blends tradition with modernity, a leader who understands
India and the world and a statesman who is accepted by all sections
of the country. In just 13 months, the Vajpayee Government
set new parameters of purposeful governance. In the realms of
national security, regional cooperation, economic modernization
and centre-state relations, the Vajpayee Government has shown
the way forward. Under Shri Vajpayee’s leadership the National
Democratic Alliance seeks a firm and resounding mandate to
complete the unfinished agenda.

The National Agenda for Governance of the National
Democratic Alliance constitutes the basis of our joint commitment
for a stable Government to take India into the new millennium.
On this occasion we appeal for a new political age of reconciliation
and accord based on our principled commitment to:

¢ National Security - ensuring full combat effectiveness of
our armed forces;

¢ National Reconstruction - an end to divisiveness and a
moratorium on contentious issues;

¢ Dynamic diplomacy - In service of motherland to obtain
for India it’s rightful place in the comity of nations;

¢ Federal harmony ensuring a partnership of the Centre and
States;

¢ Economic Modernization - harnessing technology for
rapid, equitable growth;

¢ Secularism - the emotional harmony of all Indians and
full protection of minorities;

* Social justice - empowerment of all weaker sections and
gender rights; and

¢ Probity - transparency of decision-making and corruption-
free governance.

When the whole nation was thrown into the vortex of political

Untitled-10 120 11/7/2016 11:19:17 PM

Election Manifestoes * 121

instability because of the toppling of the Government headed
by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, by the irresponsible combination
of Congress, the left parties and their old and new found allies;
when the whole nation felt that it was duped and deceived by
their chicanery because they could not fulfill their boast of an
alternative Government in ‘five minutes’ - even for several days;
and when the whole nation was on the verge of loosing faith in
our democratic system was getting cynical about politics and
politicians; the signatory political parties came together as an act
of national commitment and founded the National Democratic
Alliance (NDA), under the leadership of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
to set the Indian polity on a new course for the future.

The reason for creating the NDA is to lift the spirit of the
nation at large, to draw its people together and, most importantly,
to rebuild the bonds of common purpose that are the very roots of
our democratic polity.

The NDA came into being because of an historic need and
realisation amongst us that our young democracy cannot bear
the fits and tremors of frequent elections which will undermine
the peoples’ faith in the democratic process. Therefore, with a
consensus on a common cause and a common set of principles we
have sunk our differences to weld ourselves into a solid phalanx
of a single dominant political formation and thereby we fulfill the
resolve of the Indian people to give themselves a stable, strong
and progressive Government.

Weare proud that the NDA is representative of both national
interests and regional aspirations - after all the NDA is nothing but
the mirror-image of our nation’s unity in multifaceted diversity,
rich pluralism and federalism.

Untitled-10 121 11/7/2016 11:19:17 PM

Our Mission

THE NDA’s mission in politics is to build a bond of trust between
Government and people. This is the only way a democracy can
flourish; but unfortunately has been ignored during the last 50
years of one-party rule.

Therefore, the NDA pledges to the people of India a
Government which shares their hopes and anxieties and which
will work as partner with all people irrespective of class, caste
and religion - not just with a privileged few. This is our contract
with the people.

The NDA is new; the NDA is the future and the NDA is a
broad- based movement for progress and justice.

Our vision is one of national renewal with modern programmes
of change for a resurgent India.

We reach out to the minorities and even at the cost of repetition
proclaim that we will safeguard the rights as enshrined in our
Constitution. NDA is the political arm of none other than the Indian
people as a whole. No one will be cast aside; fairness and justice
will be rendered to one and all and we assure you that there will
not be any discrimination.

We appeal to our brothers and sisters of the minorities that we
whole-heartedly extend our hands of friendship, in these fraternal
words:

Let us hold hands and walk together to build a resurgent,
modern India.

Let us throw away our old prejudices.

Let us put an end to divisiveness.

Let us have a moratorium on contentious issues.

Let us bind ourselves with bonds of trust and friendship.

Untitled-10 122 11/7/2016 11:19:18 PM

Election Manifestoes * 123

We want an India which we all feel part of, in whose future
we all have a stake. And we want to enter the new millennium
with confidence; not with divisive feelings.

This is our call for reconciliation and it is part of our
commitment to the minorities.

Agenda For Governance

A Commitment to Good Governance
1. Our first commitment to the people is to give a stable,
honest, transparent, and efficient government capable
of accomplishing all-round development. For this, the
government shall introduce time-bound programmes of
needed administrative reforms including those for the
Police and other Civil Services.

Economy
2. We will continue with the reform process, give it a strong
Swadeshi thrust to ensure that the national economy
grows on the principle that ‘India shall be built by Indians
reappraise and revitalise reforms through giving primacy
to removal of unemployment, and to an accelerated
development of infrastructure, particularly energy and
power production. We will bring GDP growth to the
7-8% bracket, and control deficits - fiscal and revenue.
We will examine the possibility of enacting a Fiscal
Responsibility Act. We will take all such steps as would
expedite implementation of policies and programmes in
accordance with our national interests; and give to the
entire national development efforts a humane face with
total eradication of poverty as the ultimate goal. For this
‘Berozgari Hatao’ - eradicate unemployment - is our
call. Swadeshi is not reinventing the wheel. It means that
we will facilitate the domestic industry to gain enough
muscles to compete with the multinationals in the local
and global markets. We want domestic companies to

Untitled-10 124 11/7/2016 11:19:18 PM

Election Manifestoes * 125

flourish and acquire a Trans National status. At the
same time the country cannot do without FDI because
besides capital stock it brings with it technology, new
market practices and most importantly employment.
Our target is to achieve at least $10 billion per year which
will commensurate with our growth objectives. The old
leftist approach sought complete state control of industry
while the rightist approach wanted to leave everything
to the market. We reject both. Government and industry
must work together to achieve key objectives aimed at
enhancing the dynamism of the market with effective and
efficient regulatory mechanisms. In fact the issue is not
about capitalism or socialism, nor is it about market or less
state. It is about better society, about improving the way
citizens can demand and obtain all sorts of public goods.
It is about dignity for all. We firmly resolve that poverty
should be relegated to history like slavery, colonialism,
small pox and cholera and we should meet the challenge
of mobilising resources for that by undertaking the
challenge of restructuring priorities and mainstreaming
these priorities into new programmes of pro-poor growth
and redistribution towards poverty eradication-That is
how we plan to eradicate absolute poverty within this
generation-within the first decades of 21st century-and
we strongly feel that it is feasible and affordable, infact,
it is a moral imperative which we will not miss.

3. We will carefully analyse the effects of globalisation,
calibrate its process by devising a timetable to suit
our national conditions and requirements so as not to
undermine but strengthen the national economy, the
indigenous industrial base and the financial and services
sectors.

4. We will earmark 60% of the Plan Funds for and effect public
investment in agriculture, rural development, irrigation
and by diverse incentives, including tax shelters, achieve a
quantum leap in agricultural production so that agriculture,
horticulture, forestry, food processing, fisheries and so on
become the vehicles for growth resulting in an enhancement
of the purchasing power of the people. Effective crop

insurance schemes will be introduced. Special efforts will
be made in Animal Husbandry, Dairying, particularly in
respect of Cow and its progeny. This is one of the routes
to generating employment, thus eradicating hunger and
poverty in rural as well as urban areas. Subsidies of all
kinds will be implemented in such a manner that maximize
benefits to all section of the agricultural population.
Development of medium and small scale irrigation projects
shall receive priority attention; emphasis for investment
will be in accordance with the potential for development.

5. We will adopt a National Water Policy which provides
for effective and prompt settlement of disputes and their
time-bound implementation. We will examine and take
time-bound steps to link Ganga-Cauvery Rivers. Sethu
Samudharam Canal Project will also be undertaken.

6. We will increase the national savings to 30% of the GDP in
the next five years by appropriate incentives and through
motivation; encourage Foreign Direct Investment in core
areas so that it usefully supplements the national efforts
and discourage FDI in non-priority areas.

7. We will institute a comprehensive study of the financial,
technological and social security requirements of the
self-employed and unincorporated sector; also constitute
a Development Bank to promote this largest segment of
the national economy which, too, has great employment
and self-employment potential. Further, in addition to
financial support institutions we will bring into being other
institutional systems for providing services, technology
and marketing facilities for artisans, the small-scale,
village, khadi, powerloom, handloom, handicrafts and
such other industries. This and the Agriculture sectors are
an untapped source with unlimited scope for generation
of employment.

8. We will give a major thrust to infrastructure development,
particularly energy and power, by recommending public
expenditure in the sector. Towards this we will access
long-term funds in the national and international markets,
remove administrative bottlenecks, reverse the slowdown
in this critical area of national economy thus giving a fresh

impetus to growth. Private Sector participation will be
encouraged.

9. We will undertake a review of all laws and regulations
relating to industry so as to free it from bureaucratic control;
institute a system of voluntary compliance with laws,
including tax laws; ensure speedy redressal of industrial
sickness arrange for meaningful interaction between
industry and government; and revive the capital market
as a viable and transparent mechanism for raising capital.
We will also expedite comprehensive reform of the PSUs,
including restructuring, rehabilitation and divestment.

Trade & Commerce
10. We will focus on specific products in specific growth
areas for exports and announce specific packages for
horticulture EoUs.We intend to strongly support attempts
to build a system of trade and economic cooperation
through expanded global system of trade preferences
(GSTP) among developing countries. We would also assert
more robustly India’s national interests, especially at the
forthcoming review conference of the WTO, scheduled for
November 1999. A healthy commodity exchange system
will be established to be managed in an autonomous way.

Labour
11. We will make labour, both organized and unorganized,
an equal and proud partner in the production of the
nation’s wealth and in its progress. Laws relating to equal
pay for equal work for men and women shall be strictly
implemented.

Eradication of Unemployment

12. Recognizing the right to work of every citizen, the main
thrust of the new government will be: ‘Berozgaari Hatao’
(Eradicate Unemployment). As against the present trend
of jobless growth, our government will measure growth
generation of gainful employment. Our new investment
and institutional thrust to agriculture, the self-employed,
the unincorporated sector, infrastructure development and
housing will act as the vehicles for massive employment
creation at all levels.

13. The Alliance will embark upon a strategic pro-poor policy
in terms of which those living below the poverty line are
not to be pitied but treated as a net resource replete with
their own ideas and experience well in tune with local
conditions. Every effort will be made to provide them
work locally and ensure that schemes for their welfare are
competently and honestly administered. They themselves
will be treated as participants and facilitators in this noble
venture. The services of NGOs, well versed in this field
and, preferably originating locally, will also be enlisted
wherever considered necessary.

Food Security and Price Stability
14. We will ensure food security for all, create a hunger-free
India in the next five years, and reform and improve the
Public Distribution System so as to serve the poorest of
the poor in rural and urban areas. We will also ensure
price stability by all appropriate means and necessary
legislation.

Health and Drinking Water
15. We will spare no efforts to ensure that potable drinking
water is available to all villages in the next five years. Age
old and traditional methods of water utilisation, in both
rural and urban areas, will receive urgent attention.

Education for All

16. We are committed to a total eradication of illiteracy. We
will formulate and implement plans to gradually increase

Untitled-10 128 11/7/2016 11:19:19 PM

Election Manifestoes * 129

the governmental and non-governmental spending on
education upto 6% of the GDP: thus to provide education
to all. We will implement the constitutional provision of
making primary education free and compulsory upto 5th
standard. Our aim is to move towards equal access to and
opportunity of educational standards upto the school
leaving stage. We shall strive to improve the quality of
education at all levels — from primary schools to our
universities.

Housing for All

17. Shelter is a basic human requirement that needs to be met
ona priority basis. We are, therefore, committed to evolving
a National Housing and Habitat Policy in consultation
with State Governments, aimed at providing Housing
for all. Towards this end, we shall facilitate construction
of 20 lakh additional housing units annually. As in other
programmes, the emphasis will be on the benefit to the
poor and the deprived.

Empowerment of Women

18. We will legislate for the reservation of 33% of the seats in
Parliament and State Assemblies for women; also institute
plans for providing free education for girls upto college
level, including professional courses, so as to better
empower women. We will also set up a Development
Bank for women entrepreneurs in the small scale and tiny
sectors.

Harnessing Yuva Shakti
19. The youth of our country constitute the majority of our
population. They are the strength of the family, village,
locality and the community, they are also the future of
our nation. We will take all necessary steps to mobilise
this most idealistic, inspired and energetic section of our
society in the mission of nation-building. For this purpose,
we shall build national consensus for the creation of a
National Reconstruction Corps aimed at environmental
protection ecological tasks, reclamation of waste land,

including afforestation, and for spreading literacy. We will
have a time bound programme for promotion of sports.

Children
20. We will present a National Charter for Children. Our aim
is to ensure that no child remains illiterate, hungry, lacks
medical care. We will take measures to eliminate child
labour.

Population

21. We are committed to achieving population stabilization
by 2010 through improved access to primary health
services, universalisation of primary education, delivery
of contraceptive services to Mohalla/Ward/Basti level and
through betterment of educational and socio-economic
position of women.

22. Schemes for providing income generating training to
widows will be worked out in cooperation with the state
governments.

23. India today has a much larger population of senior citizens
and their numbers are expected to rise substantially. It
will be our endeavour to assure them that they continue
to remain esteemed and valuable members of society.

Constitutional and Legal Reforms

24. Weshall appoint a Commission to review the Constitution of
India not only in the light of experiences and developments
since 1996 but indeed, of the entire post-independence
period, and to make suitable recommendations.

25. Weare convinced that there is a clear case for devolution
of more financial and administrative powers and functions
to the States. We will take suitable steps to ensure
harmonious Centre-State relations in the light of the
recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission and also
effect decentralisation right upto the grass roots level by
activating and involving Panchayats and local bodies.
States of the Union where the percentage of population
below the poverty line has increased during the last five
decades shall receive special attention. A Backward Area

for their development shall be instituted. A Committee
will be set up to study the feasibility of treating all 19
languages included in Schedule 8 of the Constitution as
official languages will examine problems of Border States
for amelioration and take measures for ensuring a fixed
term (5 years) for all elected bodies including legislatures.
We will also examine replacing the present No Confidence
Motion with the German system of ‘Constructive vote of
Non-confidence’.

26. We will introduce necessary electoral reforms on the basis
of the recommendations of the Goswami Committee, the
Inderjit Gupta Committee and the Law Commission Report
so as to deal with the malaise of defections, corruption
and criminalisation of politics, and to prevent electoral
malpractices.

27. Revitalise NE Council; ensure territorial integrity of the
states of the NE; special developmental, administrative
and security related programmes.

28. We will set up a National judicial Commission which
will recommend judicial appointments in High Courts
and Supreme Court and draw up a code of ethics for the
judiciary. We will enact legislation to provide an eligibility
criteria that the high offices of State-legislative, executive
and judicial are held only by naturally born Indian citizens.
We will establish a National Register of citizens. We will
also introduce a multi-purpose identity card for all citizens.

29. We will undertake all necessary legislative and
administrative measures to ensure the right of franchise
of the Armed Forces through proxy voting and or any
other method.

Corruption

30. We will enact the Lok Pal Bill with adequate powers to
deal with corruption charges against anyone, including the
Prime Minister. In the administration of justice, we shall
not allow discrimination between the rich and the poor,
the empowered and the powerless; restore the majesty of
law, and the objectivity of the state.

New States
31. We will give full statehood to Delhi and also create
Uttranchal, Vananchal and Chhattisgarh as new States.

National Security

32. In today’s unipolar world it is of paramount importance
that India constantly maintains and strengthens the state
of preparedness, morale and combat effectiveness of our
Armed forces.

33. The recently established National Security Council will
advise the government in this regard and also in the
establishment of a credible nuclear deterrence. These are
the minimum requirements in this recently inaugurated era
of global inequality and increased vulnerability. The NDA
will correct the imbalance and budgetary neglect of Defence
needs during the last decades by successive governments
thus ensuring adequacy of budgetary allocation! We will
take effective measures for eliminating all pensionary
anomalies. We will revamp the entire system of welfare
of ex-servicemen as a tribute to those that laid down their
lives for the country.

Internal Security
34. We are committed to ensuring the safety and security of
all citizens in all parts of the country. For reaching this
goal we will take effective steps to create a riot-free order
and a terrorism-free India.

International Relations
35. In the past 13 months the government demonstrated its
capability to secure for India a place, role and position
in the global arena, commensurate with its size and
importance. We have also shown that our desire for peace
and friendship should not be interpreted as weakness but
as a firm resolve that aggression shall not be permitted to
succeed. We have effectively engaged with the international
community and obtained a high degree of understanding.
This engagement process shall be developed to improve

India’s standing in the international community.

We will promote and strengthen regional groupings on the
lines of SAARC and ASEAN, and reorient our diplomacy
to pursue economic, commercial goals and energy security
goals. We will strongly support any attempt to build a
system of trade and economic cooperation through an
expanded global system of trade preferences (GSTP) among
developing countries. We will seek to assert more robustly
India’s national interests, especially at the forthcoming
review conference of the WTO, scheduled for December,
1999. We are committed to making the voice of India as the
voice of the developing world.

Genuine Secularism

36. We are committed to establishing a civilised, humane
and just civil order; that which does not discriminate on
ground — of caste, religion, class, colour, race or sex. We
will truly and genuinely uphold and practise the concept
of secularism consistent with the Indian tradition of ‘Sarva
panth samadara’ (equal respect for all faiths) and on the
basis of equality of all. We are committed to the economic,
social and educational development of the minorities and
will take effective steps in this regard.

SCs, STs and Backwards Classes
37. The interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and
Backward Classes will be adequately safeguarded by
appropriate legal, executive and societal efforts and by
large scale education and empowerment. We will provide
legal protection to existing percentages of reservation in
government employment and educational institutions at
the Centre and State level. If required, the Constitution
will be amended to maintain the system of reservation.
We will continue to offer all assistance to the SCs, STs
and Backward Classes to ensure their speedy socio-
economic development. We will remove the last vestiges of
untouchability from our society. Further, we will present
a National Charter for Social Justice (Samajik Nyay) based
on the principle of social harmony (Samajik Samarasata).

Untitled-10 133 11/7/2016 11:19:21 PM

We are committed to extending the SC/ST reservations
for another 10 years. Reservation percentages, above 50%,
as followed by certain states shall be sanctified through
necessary legislative measures.

Environment

38. We will establish an appropriate legal framework for
the protection of the environment and unveil a National
Environment Policy to balance between development
and ecology. A Vanvasi Fund for the benefit of Vanvasis
shall be established. To discourage poaching of Wild Life
a Wild Life Anti-Poaching Authority shall be established.
The Ganga and Yamuna rivers’ cleaning programmes shall
be revamped and revitalised. Similar schemes for other
water bodies shall also be initiated.

Prasar Bharti
39. We will review the Prasar Bharti Act. We will also enact
a comprehensive Broadcasting Bill to regulate private
broadcasting and to protect Indian interests. We will restrict
foreign equity holding in private television broadcasting
to 20% (and prevent cross holding to avoid emergence of
monopolies in the media).

A New Norm For Governance by consensus
Science & Technology
40. For sustainable national development and the long-overdue

transformation of India into a modern, prosperous and
knowledge-driven nation, we will ensure integration
of efforts, in the field of science and technology with
development programmes in various socio-economic
sectors. We will further speed up the modernization of
National Laboratories, strengthen R&D and establish new
as well as strengthen existing centres of excellence, so that
they continue to constitute an invaluable national asset
and also become totally immune to policy fluctuations
elsewhere.

Information Technology

41. A new revolution is sweeping the globe — that of
Information Technology. We believe that Information
Technology is an important vehicle for future development.
We are committed to ensuring that India is full and equal
partner in this global progress; indeed, India can be a
software super power. We will, for that purpose, unveil
a National Informatics Policy with short, medium and
long-term perspective.

42. Finally, we are convinced that a nation of nearly 100
crore people representing a sixth of humanity cannot be
governed on the arithmetic alone of majority and minority.
Governance must become unifying, not divisive, in its
practice. It is this mindless manner of the domination
of the majority that has led to bitterness, hostility and
confrontation - and has even made the opposition and
ruling parties like permanent adversaries. This destructive
trend of politics of negativism and political untouchability
which has distorted our body politic in the last few decades
calls for an immediate corrective. We will, therefore,
strive to develop national consensus on all major issues
confronting the nation by involving the opposition parties
and all section, of society in dialogue. We will also try for
a consensual mode of governance as far as practicable.
This National Agenda is a sincere and solemn covenant
aimed at changing the content and culture of governance
of this great nation, freeing it of the triple curses of hunger
(bhookh), fear (bhay) and corruption (bhrashtachar), and
transforming it into a New India that is prosperous, strong,
self-confident and at peace with itself and the world. We
appeal for the cooperation of all parties and all sections
of society in this great endeavour.

Our Vision, Our Will, Our Way

Sarve bhavantu sukhinah
Sarve santu niramayah

Sarve bhadrani pasyantu

Ma kaschit dukha bhag bhavet!
Om Shanti! Shanti! Shanti!
May all live happily. May all enjoy good health.
May all see auspiciousness. May none experience distress.

May peace prevail everywhere!

THIS timeless motto of universal happiness and peace is the heritage
of this ancient Indian civilization, which assumed the character of
Bharatvarsha in Bharat Khand. Here, a nation, which Megasthanes
noted ‘never invaded others and was never invaded,’ existed long
before the ideas of civilization evolved elsewhere.

This ageless nation is the embodiment of the eternal values
enshrined in the concept of ‘Sanatana Dharma’ which, according to
Maharishi Aurobindo, is synonymous with Indian nationalism. The
idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam—world as a family —is integral to
the concept of Sanatana Dharma. This gigantic idea is an exclusively
Indian contribution to world peace. This ancient nation evolved a
world-view based on the motto Loka samasta sukhina bhavantu (Let
the entire world be happy) thousands of years before any League
of Nations or United Nations was thought of to avoid global strife.
The Indian nation evolved this grand vision not by marching its
armies and conquering the rest and offering peace; but by the
inner-directed pursuit of universal values by the Rishis living in
the forests and mountains of India.

The well-being of all, in short, is the Indian mission. It is not

Untitled-10 141 11/7/2016 11:19:21 PM

142 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

limited to the residents of Bharat or the adherents of any particular
faith or creed. That is why Bharat received with open arms all faiths
and people fleeing persecution — whether it was the Jews, Parsis,
Muslims or Christians—and preserved and protected them long
before any other civilization could think short of exterminating those
who differed from the ruling faiths and people. Israeli society has
openly acknowledged that out of over a hundred nations in which
Jews sought refuge, only in Bharat they were received and treated
well. It is because religion in ancient India meant faith in general
and not any particular faith. It is this ancient Indian mind that
formulated the Constitution of India, guaranteeing equal treatment
to all faiths and their adherents and it is not the Constitution that
shaped the Indian mind.

Diversity is an inseparable part of India’s past and present
national tradition. The BJP not only respects but celebrates India’s
regional, caste, credal, linguistic and ethnic diversity, which finds
its true existence and expression only in our national unity. This
rich tradition comprises not only the Vedas and Upanishads,
Jainagamas and Tripitaka, Puranas and Guru Granth Sahib, the
Dohas of Kabir, the various social reform movements, saints and
seers, warriors and writers, sculptors and artists, but also the Indian
traditions of the Muslims, Christians and Parsis.

The Bharatiya Janata Party is a proud inheritor of this
tradition while all other political parties have branded everything
associated with this great tradition as sectarian, unworthy of being
followed. The post-Independence tendency to reject all ancient
Indian wisdom in political life led to all pre-Independence values
and symbols —be it the idea of spiritual nationalism expounded
by Swami Vivekananda, or the concept of Ram Rajya articulated
by Mahatma Gandhi, or the soul-stirring “Vande Mataram’ song
composed by Bankim Chandra being discarded as unsecular and
unacceptable. The BJP rejects this attitude and idea of disconnecting
from the past. The past is inseverable from the present and the
future. That is why Swami Vivekananda said, ‘It is out of the past
that the future is moulded. It is the past that becomes the future’.

BJP’s Vision: An Inheritance From India’s Freedom Movement

THE BJP shares, embodies and energizes the vision of every
patriotic Indian to see our beloved country emerge as a strong,

Untitled-10 142 11/7/2016 11:19:22 PM

Election Manifestoes * 143

prosperous and confident nation, occupying her rightful place
in the international community. It is a vision to see our sacred
Motherland freed from the scourge of bhookh (hunger), berozgari
(unemployment), bhay (fear) and bhrashtachar (corruption). Lastly,
it is a vision to see India, the world’s oldest cradle of civilization,
transform itself yet again into a benign global power, contributing
her material, intellectual, cultural and spiritual energies to
change the paradigm at the global level to save the world from
the gathering civilizational crisis. As Arnold Toynbee said, ‘The
Western beginning must have an Indian ending if the world is to
be saved from destruction.’

It was this very same vision which inspired millions upon
millions of freedom-loving Indians of all castes, communities and
regions to give their all for the liberation of Mother India from the
yoke of British colonial rule. It was a vision which all the stalwarts
of our freedom movement, belonging to different ideological and
political backgrounds, said in their own separate yet complementary
ways. Mahatma Gandhi coined a uniquely Indian idiom—‘Ram
Rajya’ —for this common national vision, emphasizing, as a
cautionary direction to future rulers of India that, ‘There can be no
Ram Rajya in the present state of inequalities in which a few roll
in riches and the masses do not get even enough to eat.’

The Context and the Issue in the 12th Lok Sabha Poll

THE general elections to the 12th Lok Sabha is the inevitable
result of the instability forced on the country by the Congress and
the United Front. The two formed a negative and opportunist
combination to thwart the mandate of the people in the 11th Lok
Sabha poll and allowed the rejected Congress Party to do back-
seat driving. The negative combination was a symbol of instability
from day one and was, for most part of its existence, in intensive
care. It collapsed, as it had to and demonstrated how the mischief
played on the people of India after the 11th Lok Sabha poll recoiled
on the mischief-makers themselves. This has made stability the
principal issue in the coming election in a manner it has never
been in our history.

Also, the election to the 12th Lok Sabha is not only a vote on
the despicable record of malgovernance of the two United Front
regimes spawned by the hung 11th Lok Sabha. Rather, as the last

Untitled-10 143 11/7/2016 11:19:22 PM

144 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

parliamentary poll in this century and as one taking place in the
Swarna Jayanti year of India’s Freedom, it is a vote on nearly five
decades of misrule by the Congress and its clones.

The BJP and its allies have entered the electoral fray with
the supreme confidence of winning a clear mandate from the
people of India to rule for the next five years. This mandate will
be a vote not only against the rank instability of the two United
Front Governments, but also against the static, anti-people, anti-
development ‘stability’ of the previous Congress Governments.
At the same time, it will be a positive vote for the BJP’s solemn
pledge to provide a dynamic, pro-people, pro-development, anti-
status quoist stability under the able Prime Ministership of Shri
Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee: Ability, Integrity and Universal
Acceptability

THE positive vote for the BJP is grounded in our philosophy,
our policies, our programmatic commitments, the performance of
our State Governments and, of course, the unimpeachable personal
qualities of our top leadership. In Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the
people see a leader who combines ability with integrity, charisma
with character and experience with universal acceptability. He is
not a person who claims leadership by birth in, or relationship with,
any dynasty. He is a leader by virtue of his long and dedicated
service of the nation and its people in and out of Parliament.

Under Shri Vajpayee’s leadership, the BJP and its allies, if
elected to power, will marshal the requisite will to chart the way
towards the fulfillment of the unfinished agenda of transition from
Swaraj to Su-raj.

This Election Manifesto outlines how the BJP will effect change
with continuity. It asserts the principles and beliefs that will serve
as the beacon and an internal watchdog for the BJP in governance.
The five-fold concept of Shuchita (probity in public life), Suraksha
(security), Swadeshi (economic nationalism), Samajik Samarasata
(social harmony) and Hindutva (cultural nationalism) will constitute
the core content and ideological pillars of the BJP. These principles
will be manifest in our commitment to national security, good
governance, national unity and integration, democracy, genuine
secularism, eradication of mass poverty, opportunity for economic

Untitled-10 144 11/7/2016 11:19:22 PM

advancement for all, social justice, gender justice, harmonious
Centre-State relations, probity in public life, revival of institutions,
politics of consensus and cooperation as against confrontation and,
last but not the least, raising India’s prestige, profile and power in
the international arena.

These commitments will guide the BJP in its endeavor to
provide a Stable Government under an Able Prime Minister.

Our National Identity

Cultural Nationalism

THE BJP is committed to the concept of ‘One Nation, One People
and One Culture’. The unique cultural and social diversity in India
is woven into a larger civilizational fabric by thousands of years of
common living and common and shared values, beliefs, customs,
struggles, joy and sorrow, as well as symbols of high degree of unity
without uniformity. Our nationalist vision is not merely bound by
the geographical or political identity of Bharat but it is referred
by our timeless cultural heritage. This cultural heritage which is
central to all regions, religions and languages, is a civilizational
identity and constitutes the cultural nationalism of India which is
the core of Hindutva. This we believe is the identity of our ancient
nation ‘Bharatvarsha’.

Every effort to characterize Hindutva as a sectarian or exclusive
idea has failed as the people of India have repeatedly rejected sucha
view and the Supreme Court, too, finally endorsed the true meaning
and content of Hindutva as being consistent with the true meaning
and definition of secularism. In fact, Hindutva accepts as sacred all
forms of belief and worship. The evolution of Hindutva in politics
is the antidote to the creation of vote banks and appeasement of
sectional interests. Hindutva means justice for all.

The BJP is convinced that Hindutva has immense potentiality
to re-energize this nation and strengthen and discipline it to
undertake the arduous task of nation-building. This can and does
trigger a higher level of patriotism that can transform the country
to greater levels of efficiency and performance. It is with such
integrative ideas in mind, the BJP joined the Ram Janmabhoomi
movement for the construction of Shri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. This

Untitled-10 146 11/7/2016 11:19:23 PM

greatest mass movement in post-Independence history reoriented
the disoriented polity in India and strengthened the foundation of
cultural nationalism.

The BJP is committed to facilitate the construction of a
magnificent Shri Ram Mandir at Ram Janmasthan in Ayodhya
where a makeshift temple already exists. Shri Ram lies at the core
of Indian consciousness. The BJP will explore all consensual, legal
and constitutional means to facilitate the construction of Shri Ram
Mandir at Ayodhya.

Agenda for Institutional Rejuvenation

Strengthening Democracy’s Pillars

THE strength of a democracy is directly proportionate to the
strength of the three pillars on which it rests—the Executive, the
Legislature and the Judiciary. Five decades of misrule and misuse
of these institutions has eroded their strength. Corruption at the
highest levels of the Executive has corroded people’s faith in
Government. The Congress and UF Governments’ inability to take
firm decisions and make tough choices, apart from their failure to
confront disruptive forces, has weakened the authority of the Indian
State. Over-centralization of power at the Centre and unbalanced
models of development have led to Centre-State friction. Abuse
of constitutional provisions like Article 356 and the misuse of Raj
Bhavans as extension counters of the ruling party at the Centre
have defiled the sanctity of the country’s Constitution.

The BJP will earnestly set itself to the task of strengthening
these institutions of the Republic through an agenda of reform
and rejuvenation. The primary task is to restore to the State— and
thus to Government —its honour and prestige. The BJP will thus
restore to Government its moral authority to rule. We propose to
undertake the following agenda for rejuvenation:

Constitutional Reforms
1. The BJP will appoint a Commission to comprehensively
review the Constitution of India, in the light of the
experience of the past 50 years and make suitable
recommendations. The Commission will comprise
constitutional experts and eminent parliamentarians.
2. The BJP is committed to take necessary steps to prevent

Untitled-10 148 11/7/2016 11:19:23 PM

Election Manifestoes * 149

misuse of Article 356 of the Constitution.

3. The BJP will carve out Uttaranchal, Vananchal, Vidarbha
and Chhattisgarh as separate States. Delhi will be given
full Statehood.

4. The BJP will provide all three regions of Jammu and
Kashmir —Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh—with regional
development councils.

5. The BJP will abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution.

Electoral Reforms
THE BJP, which has been singularly championing the cause
of electoral reforms since the days of the Jana Sangh, believes that
one of the principal causes of corruption and corrosion of our
polity is our faulty election process. The BJP will, immediately
on assuming office, introduce a comprehensive Electoral Reforms
Bill, much of the groundwork for which has already been done
but not acted upon. To ensure free, fair and fearless elections and
to prevent the use of money power and muscle power, the BJP
will:
1. Update and adopt the Goswami Committee Report;
2. Consider introducing a scheme for State-funding of election
expenses incurred by all recognized parties;
3. Undertake immediate delimitation of Lok Sabha and
Assembly constituencies;
4. Make it mandatory for parties to submit audited accounts
for public scrutiny;
5. Examine the feasibility of introducing the list system or a
mixed system of elections; and;
6. Undertake the process of issuing multi-purpose identity
cards to all citizens and make it a mandatory requirement
for voting.

Judicial Reforms

THE Judiciary is one of the watchdogs in a democracy and
in recent times has played an important role in pursuing cases
of corruption and abuse of public office. But the Judiciary faces
problems that need to be addressed and solved in consultation
with the Chief Justice of India. For speedy, fair and inexpensive
justice, the BJP will:

Untitled-10 149 11/7/2016 11:19:23 PM

150 * Party Document Vol-1

1. Fill vacancies in high courts and the Supreme Court without
any delay;

2. Appoint special judges to clear the huge arrears at all
levels of the judiciary;

3. Legislate to the effect that cases are heard on a day-to-day
basis and not held up by inordinate adjournments;

4. Expand and strengthen the existing legal aid facilities for
weaker sections of society; and,

5. Set up a National Judicial Commission which will
recommend judicial appointments in the High Courts
and the Supreme Court and draw up a code of ethics for
judges.

Reforms in the Law and Order Machinery

THE security of each citizen is of utmost concern for the BJP,
which is committed to a riot-free and terrorism-free India. Whether
on the streets or at home, every Indian must feel safe and protected
from violence in any form. The BJP will squarely and purposefully
address the deteriorating law and order scenario in various parts
of the country. The BJP will:

1. Forthrightly meet all challenges to the State and its citizens
by terrorists and extremists. Our approach will be firm
but always fair;

2. Enact a suitable law to tackle terrorism while ensuring
that there are no loopholes for its misuse;

3. Provide timely assistance to State Governments to maintain
law and order by supplementing local police forces with
adequate central forces;

4. Equip police with modern arms and communication
facilities;

5. Seek immediate reports from State Governments on
incidents of police firing and monitor follow-up action,
especially in fixing of responsibility if the firing was
unprovoked or uncalled for;

6. Hold district officers squarely accountable for
mismanagement of public order and take prompt action
in light of findings of time-bound inquiries;

7. Ensure that complaints by citizens do not go unattended;

8. Improve the intelligence-gathering mechanism at all levels

Untitled-10 150 11/7/2016 11:19:23 PM

Election Manifestoes * 151

to tackle mischief-makers before they can act and keep
State Governments posted about all intelligence gathered
on a day-to-day basis;

9. Launch a nationwide drive to identify the influx of illicit
arms and their possession. Proliferation of small arms
directly affects law and order and the nation’s security;

10. Crack down on narcotics smuggling which is linked to
narco-terrorism and drug-usage. Existing law in this regard
will be made more effective and implemented;

11. Rationalize the number, structure, composition and role of
paramilitary and special forces like the National Security,
the Special Protection Group and the Rapid Action Force;
and,

12. Review VIP security arrangements so that they are neither
exaggerated nor intrusive. We will ensure that VIP security
arrangements do not affect the collective convenience of
the citizens.

Administrative Reforms

THE BJP believes that despite reduction in the traditional
regulatory role of the bureaucracy, it will remain vital to the
provision of a just and progressive administration; efficient delivery
of services to the people; and, implementation of socio-economic
development programmes. We will strive to re-inculcate in the public
service the spirit of service to the common people. Public servants
at all levels will be given due support and trust. In turn, they will
be held fully accountable for efficiency, probity and integrity. To
usher in a responsive and responsible administration, the BJP will:

1. Ensure objectivity and fairness in recruitment, promotions
and transfers.

2. Introduce suitable minimum tenures for officers manning
such posts as secretaries to the Government, chief
secretaries, DGPs and district officers;

3. Deny extension to officers after superannuation or upon
completing their fixed tenures;

4. Give protection to public servants in the discharge of their
duties and disallow interference from extraneous quarters;

5. Undertake reforms in district administration, police and
other organizations interfacing with the people, with

Untitled-10 151 11/7/2016 11:19:24 PM

152 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

emphasis on responsiveness and accountability;

6. Avoid proliferation of bureaucracy by meeting new
requirements, to the extent possible, through redeployment
and training of existing staff;

7. Give wide publicity to rights of citizens and the services
and facilities to which they are entitled;

8. Provide speedy redressal of individual and community
grievances;

9. Withdraw Government from areas of unnecessary
intervention;

10. Enhance skills and efficiency of public servants through
special training programmes;

11. Infuse talent through lateral entry of personnel;

12. Ensure speedy resolution of anomalies in implementing
the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission and
strengthen arrangements for employees’ welfare and
housing;

13. Raise the retirement age of Government employees from
58 to 60 as per the recommendations of the Fifth Pay
Commission; and,

14. Increase skills and efficiency of public servants by training
programmes; infusion of talent will also be secured by
lateral entry of people from the private sector, NGOs and
educational and research institutions.

Restructuring of Centre-State Relations

THE present iniquitous Centre-State relations not only tend
to erode the autonomy of the States and jeopardize their rightful
and legitimate role in our federal polity, but also impinge on their
financial capabilities and operational flexibility. To make Centre-
State relations more harmonious and in keeping with the spirit of
a federal polity, the BJP will:

1. Immediately implement the recommendations of the
Sarkaria Commission;

2. Consult State Governments before appointing Governors
and consider ways and means of preventing misuse of Raj
Bhavans for political purposes;

3. Increase allocation of resources to the States in real terms.
This, coupled with greater functional autonomy, can go a

Untitled-10 152 11/7/2016 11:19:24 PM

Election Manifestoes * 153

long way in making States stable, strong and prosperous.

To achieve this end, we will:

(a) Increase the States’ share of gross proceeds of Central
Tax revenues to 33 per cent;

(b) Give adequate assistance to the States to lessen the
burden imposed by the recommendations of the Fifth
Pay Commission;

(c) Allow States the freedom to raise funds by issuing
tax-free bonds;

(d) Transfer external assistance to States on the same terms
and conditions on which it is received from external
donors;

(e) Treat loans against small savings as loans in perpetuity;

(f) Increase Plan assistance to States in real terms;

4. Swiftly clear infrastructure projects in power, water and
mineral sector. The Central Electricity Authority and
Central Water Commission will function as consultancy
organizations and not have any regulatory role in project
clearance. The present policy of environmental clearance
will be reviewed.

Panchayati Raj
FOR better local self-governance at the village level, the BJP
will:

1. Introduce suitable changes in the 73rd and 74th amendments
to the Constitution with a view to further strengthening
Panchayati Raj institutions and giving them greater
autonomy;

2. Endeavor to make the Panchayati Raj institutions financially
self-reliant.

Systemic Cure for Corruption

THE BJP believes that morality and ethics together form the
underpinning of good governance. In the past 50 years, the Congress
has systematically dismantled all norms of honesty and integrity
in Government, indulging in corruption at all levels and resisting
all attempts to bring the guilty to book. The UF had declared its
intention to expose the corrupt, but ended up protecting them
from the arms of justice. The BJP will seek to undo this grievous
wrong committed against the nation by the Congress and later by

Untitled-10 153 11/7/2016 11:19:24 PM

154 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

the UF and set an example of unimpeachable accountability and
impeccable probity in public life. For a clean public life, the BJP will:

1. Make it obligatory for every elected representative to
make public within 90 days his income and assets, as well
as those of his/her spouse and dependent children and
parents. These declarations will be open to public scrutiny
and have to be made every year;

2. Appoint a Lok Pal to inquire into allegations of corruption
against anybody holding public office, including the Prime
Minister;

3. Introduce extensive regulations to ensure that conflict of
interest does not influence decisions taken by those holding
public office;

4. Modify and reform the methodology of Government
approval of contracts, schemes and large value agreements
to make them more transparent;

5. The powers of patronage, the discretion to say ‘Yes’ or
‘No’ to simple daily requirements of the citizens will be
done away with;

6. Expeditiously deal with unresolved cases of corruption
and in which no action has been taken in the last 12 years;
and,

7. Give greater autonomy to the CBI, in keeping with the
recent Supreme Court order, so as to prevent investigating
agencies from being used to subserve the political designs
of the ruling party.

Right to Information
THE BJP believes in taking concrete steps to promote
transparency in the functioning of Government as a confidence-
building measure. The working of a Government should not only be
transparent but should be perceived to be so. We, therefore, subscribe
to the principle of sharing information about the Government's
work. The BJP will:
1. Enhance public access to information to the maximum
extent feasible;
2. Review laws and regulations concerning confidentiality;
and,
3. Introduce social audit of development programmes,

Untitled-10 154 11/7/2016 11:19:24 PM

especially in rural areas.

Our Swadeshi Approach

Making India a Global Economic Power

THE economic policy-making in the last five decades has been
shaped more by dogma than by a rational debate on what suits
the country’s interests best. In 1950, Congress discarded the
Gandhian approach and adopted the socialist pattern without
any debate. Now, after the collapse of the socialist paradigm, our
entire establishment has defected to the type of free-market system
that prevails in the Western countries, once again without any
debate as to whether such a system can be wholly transplanted
to India. The policies of liberalization, particularly globalization,
pursued by the Congress and later by the UF Government have
resulted in economic stagnation. What this nation needs now is a
practical approach that is devoid of dogma and is guided wholly by
considerations of national interest and what is appropriate for us.

Fifty Years of Wasted Opportunities

IN fact, the five decades of Congress and quasi-Congress rule
have been a virtually wasted opportunity. In these fifty years the
absolute numbers of people living below the poverty line almost
doubled; the Indian economy grew at a mere 3.5 per cent while
most of Asia raced ahead towards prosperity. At the same time,
Indian industry, services and agriculture were largely rendered
internationally non-competitive and disadvantaged. During
most of this period the BJP and its forerunner, the Bharatiya Jana
Sangh, had been urging a liberal economic regime in which the
full creative genius of the Indian people could flower. We opposed
the license-permit Raj. We opposed the command economy. We
opposed senseless central planning. We opposed the inefficient State

Untitled-10 156 11/7/2016 11:19:25 PM

Election Manifestoes * 157

capitalism that was promoted at the cost of our entrepreneurial class.
We opposed the crony capitalism that came about as a result of the
collusion between the politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.
We opposed the nationalization of vast areas of the economy. We
opposed the corruption that inevitably became a part of the system
that was created. We continuously opposed the Congress party that
was both the creator and then the creature of this corrupt system.

Phony Liberalization: A More Impoverished Economy

AFTER four-and-a-half grossly wasted decades, the Congress
Government of the day woke up to the bankrupt reality, but, under
the guise of correcting the past wrongs, actually surrendered to
IMF conditionalities. With a gun at its head it began to do what it
does best — double talk. It said it was liberalizing the economy and
actually gave itself more opportunities for corruption. This phony
liberalization turned out to be a period of record loot under which
foreign companies flourished and the Indian ones floundered. Within
the first year, as the Finance Minister crowed that the surge in the
share market was a sign of confidence in his policies, the bubble
burst to uncover a scam of record proportions. Foreign companies
were allowed to increase their equity at par instead of paying the
market price for additional shares. Over 2,100 companies were
allowed to raise over Rs. 35,800 crore from the market, mostly at
unreasonable premia. The markets have since come down to abysmal
levels; as a result millions were financially devastated. More than
600 of these companies, which cumulatively raised over Rs. 10,000
crore, have simply disappeared, walking off with the money. The
Congress Party has no answer for this. Many in the Cabinet were
directly involved in the scams. The then Prime Minister’s office,
too, was not exempt from this taint.

The last six years, when the much-touted reform has been
under way, have been years of extreme difficulty for the common
man. The wholesale price index of food grains has gone up by over
70 per cent, which is an effective inflation rate of over 20 per cent.
Instead of creating prosperity for all, this so-called liberalization
further impoverished the majority with a result that, according
to the NCAER, 59 per cent of all households now have a monthly
income of less than Rs. 1,000 or about Rs. 200 per person which is
much less than the poverty level monthly per capita income of Rs.

Untitled-10 157 11/7/2016 11:19:25 PM

158 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

263! By contrast, only 4.1 per cent of all families have an income of
over Rs. 40,000 per year. A study by Oxfam, while somewhat more
charitable as far as the overall figures are concerned, categorically
states that rural poverty during the Manmohan Singh years grew
from 35.5 per cent to 48.6 per cent. After this period of so-called
liberalization and growth, so much hyped by the Congress and
later by the quasi-Congress UF Governments, we have become a
more impoverished society than before. According to the World
Development Report, the highest 20 per cent of Indians accounted
for 41.3 per cent of the national income, while the bottom 20 per cent
accounted for a mere 8.8 per cent! The hollowness of the economic
policies of the past fifty years and, in particular, of the past seven
years stands totally exposed by the glaring inequity and the high
incidence of poverty.

From 1981-82 to 1990-91 industrial production grew at
an average of 7.8 per cent a year. After five years of so-called
liberalization it grew at an average of 5.7 per cent. During the
period 1990-96, in a reversal of the previous decade’s performance,
the compound growth rate of foodgrain production was 1.7 per
cent while the population grew at 1.9 per cent. Consequently, the
per capita availability of cereals, which was 511 grams in 1991,
has come down to 464 grams now. It is small wonder that prices
of cereals alone have gone up by almost 20 per cent in 1996 while
those of vegetables have risen by a huge 63.3 per cent. The prices of
wheat and onions have spiraled while those of luxury cars, mobile
phones and color TVs have come down. This is indicative of the
warped sense of economic and social justice that has been prevailing
in our country in the past few years. Instead of waking up to the
deteriorating foodgrain scenario, successive Governments have
been neglecting agriculture. In 1996-97, the proposed outlay for
agriculture was Rs. 1,969 crore or Rs. 349 crore over the previous
year’s revised estimate. This did not even cover the official inflation
and the impact of the Pay Commission’s recommendations.

The Swadeshi Approach: Reforming the Reforms Process

IN 1991, the BJP cautioned the Government to embark upon
internal liberalization first and defer globalization. We advocated
the reinstatement of the Swadeshi idea particularly because of
the heavily one-sided pro-West WTO in the offing. However, ina

Untitled-10 158 11/7/2016 11:19:25 PM

Election Manifestoes * 159

matter of five years, the BJP stand on Swadeshi has been vindicated.

Swadeshi simply means ‘India First’. This is the governing
principle of all nations. Now the idea of Swadeshi is being accepted
in most quarters, also by the Indian industry. Nevertheless, the
economy of India has come under tremendous pressure because
of misguided tariff reductions and an uneven playing field for
the Indian industry. The BJP is fully aware that, when it comes
to power, it will be inheriting a badly managed economy and a
badly directed reform process. The broad agenda of the BJP will
be guided by Swadeshi or economic nationalism.

The fundamental approach of the BJP is that it is imperative to
develop a collective national will and confidence that ‘India shall
be built by Indians’. National development will largely depend
upon national effort and national capital and savings. Even after
the so-called reforms, the share of FDI in national investment is
less than 2 per cent, that is, out of the total national investment
of over Rs. 12,30,000 crore, FDI amounted to only Rs. 18,500 crore
during the years 1991 to 1996. It is clear that foreign capital will
be only of little value to the national economy, though crucial to
some sectors like infrastructure.

Every nation advocates free trade in all global fora, but, in
practice, they compulsively resort to quotas, tariffs and anti-dumping
measures to protect their national interests. Whether it is the USA
which resorts to Super 301, anti-dumping and high tariff, or it is
Japan whose market is very difficult to access even now, the story is
the same. While the declared agenda is free trade, the undeclared,
but actual, agenda is economic nationalism. India, too, must follow
its own national agenda. This spirit is Swadeshi.

Role of Government in a Liberalized Regime

THERE is a great misconception about the role of the
Government in a liberalized regime. There is an impression that
the Government retreats leaving the hidden hand of the market to
manage the economy. Governments all over continue to actively
manage and protect their economies, national industry and
employment. The paradox is that, the greater the liberalization, the
more demanding is the involvement of the Government to protect
national industry and employment.

Untitled-10 159 11/7/2016 11:19:25 PM

160 * Party Document Vol-1

Full Liberalization and Calibrated Globalization

THE Government and Indian industry need to evolve a
consensus on the time span required to enable our industries to
adjust to the exacting demands of international competition. It means
rapid, large-scale internal liberalization, but calibrated globalization
so that the Indian industry gets a period of seven to ten years for
substantial integration with the global economy. On the basis of
this consensus, the Government and the industry should work out
a strategy to create an atmosphere of international acceptability
and manage external relations, particularly with the WTO.

India must move carefully and gradually towards integration
with the global economy and even as it so does, it must act in a
manner that suits its national interest. This strategy recognizes
that Indian industry needs a period of transition before it can
compete with global players. All policies of tariff reduction and
lifting of quantitative restrictions will be formulated taking the
above facts into accounts, but the objective will be to protect the
national economy and national interest like all nations do and not
to indulge in economic isolationism.

Study and Appraise the Impact of Reforms on the Economy

THE process of liberalization and economic reforms needs to
be properly strategized from the standpoint of broader national
interest and rationally phased in. In doing so, the experience of
the Asian nations presently under pressure will also have to be
taken into account. As we approach the 21st century, we need to
institute studies and appraise and review the reforms process and
also the proposed reforms and redefine the broad contours of the
national strategy for the next ten years. Based on the appraisal,
the BJP Government will clearly define the contours and schedule
of the liberalization and reforms. The procedural reforms like
rectification of corporate law, tax law and other commercial laws will
be separated from policy formulation like the policy on insurance
and pension funds.

Our Medium-Term Agenda

THE broad national agenda of the BJP, containing an illustrative
list of important and priority items for preparing the nation for
future challenges, is set out below:

Untitled-10 160 11/7/2016 11:19:26 PM

Election Manifestoes * 161

1. India must adopt policies that will enable a sustained 8
to 9 per cent annual rate of growth of GDP. This would
mean an agricultural growth of at least 5 per cent a year
and industrial growth of at least 12 per cent a year. Without
powering agriculture in a big way, Indian growth rate
cannot be sustained at higher levels. China, endowed
with much less cultivable land and resources, could
achieve an average agricultural growth of 8 to 10 per cent
a year between 1983 to 1993 and doubled its agricultural
production. India can and should achieve this and more.
The agricultural agenda should be designed accordingly.
A separate agenda for the non-corporate sector, which
accounts for 40 per cent of the GDP, should also be
pursued to achieve this target of sustained high growth.
Recognizing the gross neglect of proper strategy in the past,
our Government will focus on a judicious combination of
infrastructure and agriculture to achieve a high trajectory
of growth.

2. In the next five years, we must become a credible partner
in Asia’s development process and forge a relationship
on equal terms with the major economic powers of the
world —USA, EU and Japan.

3. In the next three years, our Government will strive to
achieve strong macro-economic fundamentals; fiscal
rectitude where, more than fiscal deficit, the revenue
deficit is controlled; strong and viable balance of payments;
monetary policy designed to resist unrealistic fall in
rupee value; moderate inflation; and credit availability
to industry.

Some Important and Priority Items for the National Agenda

1. The Government will formulate a system of voluntary
compliance with all direct and indirect tax obligations
with test-check assessments of select cases and expedite
conviction of the defaulters.

2. The Government will ensure a day-to-day working
relationship with Indian industry through a structured
forum like the MITI in Japan.

3. Even as the private sector will be encouraged to invest

Untitled-10 161 11/7/2016 11:19:26 PM

162 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

in infrastructure, the Government will also invest in

infrastructure. The private sector has not been a major

contributor in this area. Even in the developed world, the

share of the private sector in such development does not

exceed 30 to 40 per cent. For this purpose, the Government

will:

¢ Access the long-term debt market in Insurance and
Pension Funds.

¢ Set up national-level regulatory bodies for different
areas of infrastructure.

¢ Bring about more transparency, institute contracts
which are easily enforceable and formulate laws that
simplify the procedures.

It will also:

¢ Cut non-productive expenditure;

¢ Disinvest in non-strategic PSUs;

¢ Control and rationalize subsidies and trim all except
those that benefit the weaker sections;

¢ Reduce the size of the Government; and,

¢ Simplify tax laws and widen the tax net.

4. The Government will institute an effective anti-dumping
machinery to prevent dumping from abroad and to prevent
unfair anti-dumping action against the country.

5. The Government will ensure that a climate of competition
is created in the insurance sector — if need be, by involving
Indian private sector in the insurance business.

6. The Government will rationalize the banking sector by
creating specialization in unit banking, retail banking and
commercial banking. This will be done by consolidation and
mergers to create global-size banks and promote efficiency
and profitability to strengthen the Indian banking system.

Resource Generation: Fiscal Policy and the Promotion of Savings

All the above tasks will need large-scale resource mobilization.
This will not only call for the widening of the tax base but also
supplementing it with non-tax revenues. The BJP Government shall
innovate such resource augmentation through motivated savings.
The fiscal policy will aim to prevent the generation of black money.
Tax on services will be reviewed.

Untitled-10 162 11/7/2016 11:19:26 PM

Election Manifestoes * 163

We will structure a fiscal policy that will help generate a
higher level of savings. We will aim to increase the savings rate
to 30 per cent in the next five years. Acceleration of savings will
require the elimination of dissavings, which, in its wake, will
prune the size of Government and the public sector and generate
the much-needed resources for attending to the highly neglected
areas of social infrastructure like education and public health.
Like physical infrastructure, social infrastructure will be a priority
on the agenda of the BJP Government. In their abortive zeal for
containing the fiscal deficit, previous Governments have cut plan
expenditure drastically and, instead, increased revenue expenditure
in unpruned regulatory arms of Government which have outlived
their utility in the era of liberalization. This trend will be reversed
and it is expected that the reactivation of public expenditure will
pull the economy out of demand stagnation and recession. It should
be recognized that the halt in public investment in infrastructure,
both physical and social, in the fond hope that did not materialize,
of the private sector making good the gap, has caused undue harm
to the economy.

Eradication of Poverty Through Generation of Jobs

THE above strategy is also firmly rooted in the recognition
that growth cannot be sustained in the backdrop of accentuation in
poverty and human misery. Poverty cannot also be wished away
through an abstract definition built on calorific value. A meaningful
estimation of poverty will now be structured on the matrix of factors
that dilute the quality of life such as illiteracy, lack of sustained
employment, malnutrition, lack of shelter, safe drinking water,
sanitation and health care. The lot of the poor, thus defined, will
be improved through a multi-pronged approach, with the focus
on increased employment opportunities. The BJP Government will
make the Ninth Plan itself an employment-focused Plan.

The development strategy followed in the last fifty years
separates development from employment, treating human
beings as fodder in the process of development. Employment has
only received lip service in the economic plans; in effect it has
received a very low priority. Employment has been treated as a
by-product and not the main goal of development. It has been
more so since 1991 under the half-baked reform philosophy. The

Untitled-10 163 11/7/2016 11:19:26 PM

164 * Party Document Vol-1

all-West model of the reforms generates only jobless growth. The
BJP believes that it is only through full employment — not just any
kind of employment, but gainful and productive employment —
that rapid and sustainable development is possible. It is through
employment that the real purpose of development, namely, the
raising of the living standards and dignity of the people, can be
realized.

Itis distressing tonote that unemploymentand underemployment
and, consequently, poverty-prevails in our country on sucha massive
scale. Even when the GDP growth rates have increased, employment
growth rates have declined in agriculture as well as in industry. The
prevailing employment growth rate is less than half of the rate at
which addition to the labour force takes place. The BJP will review
the Ninth Plan in all its aspects, with the objective of installing
employment as its centrepiece. In the next ten years, over 10 crore
people will be provided jobs, besides ameliorating the extensive
underemployment and concealed unemployment. Our strategy will
consist of the following:

1. A substantially higher growth rate of GDP of 8 to 9 per

cent;

2. Emphasis on sectors which offer large potential for
employment, including small-scale, artisan-based and
rural industries, infrastructure, housing (urban and rural),
construction, agriculture, wasteland development and
forestry and labour-intensive production;

3. Opting for projects and technologies, wherever choices
exist, without reducing productivity, that offer larger
employment;

4. Increasing productivity in the informal sector through the
support of technology, credit and marketing;

5. Redesigning the special employment programmes —
Integrated Rural Development Programme, Jawahar Rozgar
Yojana, Nehru Rozgar Yojana, Scheme for self-employment
of the Educated Youth, etc.—to increase their coverage
and effectiveness;

6. Encouraging the employment of women;

7. Fully involving the private sector and non-governmental

Our Commitment: Removal of Hunger and Ensuring Food for All

IN this fiftieth year of Indian independence, we commit
ourselves to freeing India of the scourge of hunger. The Indian
social traditions abhor hunger and had instituted different
social, religious and cultural mechanisms to eliminate hunger.
The tradition which acted as a social security against hunger
weakened with the advent of colonialism and it never revived
after we attained freedom. The result is that hunger has become
part of Indian social life. We have to and we shall, ensure that
in this land, no one is obliged to sleep on a hungry stomach.
For this purpose, we shall explore and encourage all possible
ways, both Governmental and societal, of ensuring food for all.
As a concomitant of food for all, we shall recast the agricultural
policy of the country to increase food production so that India
once again becomes the land of abundance in food in next five
years.

Public Sector Reforms

CUTTING down of dissavings will be possible only by pruning
the public sector and confining it to sensitive areas where the
nation’s physical or economic security is involved and to residual
areas where the presence of public sector is necessary for providing
a moderating or counterpoising role to the ill effects, if any, of
an unchecked private sector. The minimal public sector will be
managed professionally, with least interference by Government.
While pruning the public sector, it will be ensured that the interests
of workers are duly taken care of. Greater emphasis will be placed
on retraining and redeployment aspects of the National Renewal
Fund rather than confining its scope to retrenchment.

Role of Foreign Direct Investment

It is needless to add that national development will be largely
funded by capital generated within the country and foreign
investment will play only a small role. The percentage of FDI to

Untitled-10 165 11/7/2016 11:19:27 PM

166 * Party Document Vol-1

total investment in India during the years 1991-96 is less than 2
per cent and confirms that even in the post-reform period, national
development has been almost entirely financed by local capital.
However, in areas like infrastructure (particularly energy, roads
and ports), promotion of exports and high-technology industries,
FDI can usefully supplement national efforts. Policies will be
framed consistent with national interest in respect of FDI. The BJP
Government will ensure that FDI flows into such priority areas and
not in areas where the domestic industry is functioning well. The
BJP Government will frame policies to restrict FDI in non-priority
areas. FDI will be encouraged to promote exports rather than target
the domestic market. FDI is welcome in a non-predatory role in
joint ventures rather than in 100 per cent subsidiaries. Generally,
the role of foreign capital should be in harmony with and advance,
the nation’s economic objectives, as also in line with other Asian
countries. Again, until the Indian economy reaches a level of
global strength, takeovers of existing Indian companies by foreign
companies will not be encouraged and suitable, transparent rules
will be framed to give effect to this policy. Even developed nations
like France, Germany and Switzerland have restrictions on the
takeover of domestic companies.

National Agenda for Bhagidari Sector (Un-incorporated Sector)

An analysis of India’s GDP shows that agricultural accounts for
27 per cent; corporate sector 12 per cent; and the Government sector
21 per cent; all adding up to 60 per cent. The balance 40 per cent
of the GDP comes from the largest segment of our economy — the
unincorporated sector (partnership/ proprietorship firms) which
bore the brunt of the license-permit quota raj at the cutting edge
of its interaction with the organs of State power. Millions of un-
incorporated enterprises in the country contributing 40 per cent
of our national income did not deserve even a small paragraph in
our Economic Surveys and Reserve Bank reports.

This most important segment has so far commanded the least
attention and virtually no legitimacy. The entire establishment
ignored these unincorporated enterprises which have a share of
nearly 50 per cent of national income in the manufacturing sector,
a share of 60 per cent in the construction sector, a share of more
than 75 per cent in the transport sector, nearly 90 per cent in the
trade sector, more than 80 per cent in hotels and restaurants and

Untitled-10 166 11/7/2016 11:19:27 PM

Election Manifestoes * 167

nearly 100 per cent in the business and other services like that of a
doctor, lawyer, accountant, goldsmith, plumber, porter, mechanic,
electrician, tailor, barber, carpenter, driver, priest, cook, musician
and in the crafts and professions. We neglected this sector (which
is clubbed as part of households in our savings statistics) which
constitute the largest segment of savers contributing around 60 per
cent of our national savings. During 1990-96 out of the total gross
domestic savings of Rs. 11,32,029 crore, the savings by household
sector was Rs. 8,94,918 crore, i.e. nearly 80 per cent and the Bhagidari
sector is the largest segment of the household sector other than
the salary earners.

Any agenda for reform necessarily has to focus its attention on
the largest segment of our economy which was also the least cared
for during the inspector-raj nurtured by the socialistic regime. But
the so-called reforms of the nineties did not address the serious
issues of using the phenomenal and enormous savings rate of our
middle-class.

The focus of the Government in the nineties, in the name
of reforms, concentrated essentially on the corporate sector and
foreign investment that came a cropper. A clear understanding and
a broad national agenda, with the following measures, are needed
for the Bhagidari sector.

(a) The financing cost for this sector is phenomenal and they
borrow at usurious interest rates. There is no exclusive,
national-level financing agency for trade activities or
for construction activities. Indian private-sector banks
need to be encouraged and developed in these areas and
the Government policies should facilitate the same. A
separate development bank for this sector will also be
considered.

(b) There is no social security net for this sector. With changing
patterns in the joint family system, there is even more
necessity to introduce the same. The Indian private sector
insurance companies can provide this. Unless and until the
social security net is developed for this sector (of course,
from the contributions of this sector), economic reforms
will be a castle built on American sands and the European
air, but not on Indian soil.

(c) In order to mobilize savings of this sectors for targeted

Untitled-10 167 11/7/2016 11:19:27 PM

168 * Party Document Vol-1

poverty alleviation programmes, it would be desirable that
full deduction is given for the traditional commitments of
the sector, including family obligation and contribution of
this sector for temples, mosque, gurudwaras, etc. where
free food is provided to poor people daily. This would
reduce the leakages in the anti-poverty schemes currently
undertaken, since this method would directly deal with
the target groups. Local citizens committee can monitor
this. The fear of God is a more powerful authority than
that of the Government in a country like India.

(d) This sector is a target for all levels of the State machinery
like politicians, policemen, tax officials and municipal
authorities. A national-level awareness programme of this
sector’s contribution and a national-level law to guard
them against State excesses should also be formulated.

This sector has the greatest potentiality to grow with a

quantum jump if this agenda is implemented. Any attempt to
increase employment and to eradicate unemployment must begin
here. This sector at once provides self-employment and multiplies
employment. This single sector has the greatest potentiality to
attack unemployment, poverty and hunger.

Role of Non-Banking Finance Companies

THE BJP realizes that savings, banking and finance is in
the Indian blood. There are tens of thousands of private finance
institutions - nidhis, chits and other native methods of augmenting
finance and also modern-day non-banking finance institutions. The
BJP views this sector as a potentially important one. The policy on
NBFCs has been ad-hoc and they have been dealt with, at times,
in a reckless manner. The new RBI guidelines preventing NBFCs
from accepting deposits without rating is absurd, as we have not
even developed standards for rating under Indian conditions. The
BJP will review the entire regulation on the NBFCs and bring about
an orderly growth and not planned destruction of this important
segment. This sector alone finances most of the transportation
business and the non-corporate sector, which is the most important
and the largest sector of the national economy.

Industrial Policy Reform

THE immediate task of the new Government will have to
be to create conditions for industry to regain its lost momentum.
Persistence of the present conditions will cause irreparable damage
to the fabric of Indian industry. The BJP recognizes the need for
corrective action on a war footing. We attach particular importance
to the interdependence of industry and agriculture. We will improve
inter-sectoral terms of trade and other linkages so that benefits
accrue to both. The BJP also reiterates the importance of the small-
scale and cottage industry sectors, in view of their contribution
to employment, wider participation and new entrepreneurship.
These sectors, which have suffered neglect by the Congress and
the United Front Governments, will be given all encouragement
and support by the BJP.

The permit-quota raj created conflicts between large and
small industries. The BJP will strive to make small-scale units and
large units, particularly where the former is the supplier of the
latter, into a structured ally like in Japan and Korea. The BJP will
formulate policies for large units to invest up to 25 per cent in the
capital of the small unit so that the small unit has the backing of
the large unit for purposes of availing bank loans or other credit.
By such a relationship, hundreds of small units can coalesce with
a large-scale unit and benefit in a variety of ways.

In order to achieve the above objective, the BJP will:

1. Further simplify industrial approvals and remove the
plethora of restrictive controls that now exist. The Industrial
Development and Regulation Act will be replaced by an
Industrial Development Act. The role of the Government
will change from the restrictive, as it has been so far, to one
of extending support and encouragement;

2. Encourage research and development in enterprises as
well as in specialized institutions;

3. Permit hazardous industries only in specified areas. Separate
satellite industrial parks will be set up exclusively for such
units;

4. Give all encouragement and support to the small-scale and
cottage industry sectors. Agencies will be established to
give them help in getting scarce raw materials, technology
upgradation and marketing of their products. Flow of credit

Untitled-10 169 11/7/2016 11:19:28 PM

170 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

to these sectors will be enhanced. We will reconsider the
Abid Hussain Committee recommendations on SSI units in
the light of the difficulties and apprehensions of SSI. The
investment limit of Rs. 3 crore will also be reviewed if any
misuse of the higher limit is found. The tiny sector will be
relieved of labour laws and other legislations by which they
are subject to harassment; and,

5. Ensure a healthy capital market with the twin objectives
of increasing capital investment in the corporate sector
and of providing protection to the investing public.

Making Labour a Proud Partner in the Nation’s Progress
OUR plan to reform the reform process through the Swadeshi
approach, includes:

1. Astrong commitment to make labour, both organized and
unorganized, an equal and proud partner in the nation’s
progress;

2. Rationalize and simplify labour laws.

Recognize trade unions on the basis of secret ballot.

4. Introduce worker-participation from the shopfloor to the
boardroom.

5. Strengthen institutional mechanisms to ensure speedy,
just and corruption-free redressal of labour grievances.

Policy on Tourism

THE BJP recognizes the importance of tourism as a generator

of jobs and foreign exchange. Its Government will:

1. Promote tourism as a way to have a more meaningful and
wider understanding of India and its people.

2. Evolve a national policy for tourism to provide needed
infrastructure such as hotels, transports and removal of
bureaucratic impediments.

3. Create a regulatory mechanism to avoid long-term damage
to the heritage and the environment.

4. Take care of the pilgrimage component of tourism by
ensuring the cleanliness, basic facilities, etc. at pilgrimage
centres of all sects.

5. Shift the exclusive emphasis from five-star tourism to
tourism for the masses.

Untitled-10 170 11/7/2016 11:19:28 PM

Election Manifestoes * 171

6. Enable India to have its rightful share in the growing global
tourism industry, while ensuring that Indian culture,
heritage and values are preserved and projected.

Policy on Infrastructure

SINCE infrastructure constitutes a critical aspect of the national
economy, an overview of the BJP’s thinking on infrastructure is
presented under:

Policy on Energy and Power

INVESTMENT in power must be accelerated urgently. Any
further delay in adding new capacity will inflict considerable costs
on the economy.

1. In power generation, most of the private sector investments
have got bogged down in never-ending negotiations. The
Government will ensure that all eight ‘fast track’ projects
start construction in 1998.

2. Transmission and distribution need to be strengthened.
After appropriate study, a National and/or Regional
Power Trading Corporation may be set up for efficient
use of the generated power. Power Grid Corporation’s
plans to implement a national grid will be speeded up. To
ensure that private investors in this sub-sector do not have
the same experience as their counterparts in generation,
the Government will create a standardized application
procedure with clear and transparent rules for their entry;

3. The Government will strive for a national consensus to
ensure that, in five years, a commercially viable power
tariff structure comes into operation;

4. BHEL will be revitalized to expand its capacity to emerge
as a global player in the next five years;

5. The Government will review the liquid fuel policy and
institute a more efficient and fair policy regime;

6. To encourage non-conventional sources of energy, the
Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources and IREDA
will be strengthened. Large-scale research and development
will be instituted to develop more non-conventional energy;

7. Other things being equal, preference will be given to Indian
companies in power generation and distribution;

Untitled-10 171 11/7/2016 11:19:28 PM

172 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

8. The long-stalled nuclear power programme will be restarted.
India has mastered the technology and the entire nuclear fuel
cycle. There is no reason why only two nuclear plants have
gone critical in the last seven years. Instead of importing
nuclear power technology from Russia, there is no reason
why our trained engineers should not be exporting Indian
nuclear power technology to foreign countries;

9. In the oil sector, the Government will involve the Indian
private sector in oil extraction and refining on the explored
oil fields and will, on viable terms, allow Indian joint
ventures with foreign companies in oil exploration and
extraction; and,

10. In the coal sector, the Government will increase the
production of coal, reduce costs and raise productivity.
It will involve the Indian private sector in coal mining so
as to meet the increased energy needs of the country.

Railways
TRANSPORT must become multi-modal to meet the needs of
development. The most important type of transport is the Indian
Railways. The rate of growth of the Railways has come down. A
complete review of the working of the Indian Railways would have
to be undertaken along with a study of the use of roads in the areas
served by the Railways. There are thousands of kilometers of rail
track lying unused, while the roads alongside those very tracks
are overburdened with traffic, despite Railways being cheaper.
1. Private participation in using such idle railway tracks will
be allowed;
2. An efficiency audit of the Railways will have to be done
to prevent wastage and disuse of stores and rolling stock;
3. Also, a study should be done to ensure that trains carry
payloads up to 4,000 tonnes;
4. We will institute research and development for the Indian
Railways suited to Indian conditions.;
5. Container transport will be encouraged on a point-to-point
basis; and,
6. The Railways will also run pilgrimage specials connecting
the several places of pilgrimage in the country both from
a commercial point of view and service to the pilgrims,

Untitled-10. 172 11/7/2016 11:19:28 PM

Election Manifestoes * 173

as well as from the standpoint of national integration.

Roads and Bridges

INADEQUATE road networks have led to higher transportation
costs that have also eroded the international competitiveness of the
Indian economy. Trucks in India travel only 200-250 kilometers a
day, compared to 500-600 kilometers a day in developed countries.
Therefore, proper road construction will lead to a big increase in
transport efficiency. For this purpose, the BJP will do the following
things:

1. The National Highways Authority of India will be made
the regulator for this sector. It will be responsible for setting
tolls, inviting bids from private companies, evaluating
them and awarding them. The BJP will continue with the
current fiscal incentives for this sector. Like in other sectors,
it will identify the non-fiscal barriers to investment in this
sector, for their speedy removal;

2. The Government will identify the four most heavily used
stretches of the national highway system. It will formulate
and implement an action plan to upgrade them within two
years using both the public and private sectors wherever
necessary. It is important that these critical bottlenecks be
removed as soon as possible;

3. For all other highways, the Government will invite the
private sector to upgrade them, for which they will collect
toll revenues. If the private sector is not interested, the
Government will create a State-owned National Highway
Development Corporation that will go ahead and upgrade
these highways, for which it will also levy tolls;

4. A proportion of the taxes on motor vehicles and on petrol
and diesel collected in each city will be handed over to that
city or town to use to upgrade the roads in those cities;
and,

5. Except for very long distance and high investment projects,
the policy will be to involve only the Indian private sector
in the bids.

Inland Waterways

THERE is an enormous potential for inland waterways in
India. The estimated length of waterways available is over 30,000
kilometers and they touch almost all the important centres in our
country. The cost of water transport is a third of the cost of surface
transport. Waterways were once considered to be better for India
than other forms of transport in many areas. The development of
waterways will also lead to the proper maintenance of reservoirs
and canals, since revenue would be generated from water transport.
The BJP will develop a blueprint for water transport and allow
private parties to get into inland water transport.

Sea Ports

MOST Indian ports are operating at more than 100 per cent
capacity. Yet they are very inefficient when compared to other parts
in the region. As part of a proper ports development programme,
the BJP will do the following things:

1. Convert ports into companies that can raise funds from
the debt and equity markets. The initial shareholding of
this company can be divided four ways with the central
Government, the State Government, the city administration
and the general public;

2. Ports will be encouraged to invest in the latest information
technology and cargo handling equipment to reduce
turnaround time;

3. The workers of ports should be retrained to use these new
technologies. Ports must be more efficient, but they need
to become so without displacing too many workers;

4. Develop Mumbai and Vishakhapatnam ports as megaports,
which will be warehouses for the country on either
seaboard;

5. Private sector minor ports should be encouraged. They
will take the load of the bigger ports; and

6. Except for large international ports, in other cases,
preference will be given to Indian companies.

Coastal Shipping

INDIA has a long coastline and its peninsular formation is
ideally suited for development of coastal shipping. Considering

Untitled-10 174 11/7/2016 11:19:29 PM

Election Manifestoes * 175

that coastal shipping is cheaper than surface transport and further
considering that nearly 30 per cent of the cargo carried by Indian
Railways is coal, coastal shipping can relieve the surface transport
sector of a big burden. Indian private sector will be involved in
coastal shipping development. Cheaper movement of coal by
coastal shipping will also enable thermal power generation along
the coastline to transmit power inland.

Telecommunications
The aim of our telecom policy will be to:

1. Increase the number of phone lines dramatically, especially
in villages; and,

2. Satisfy the more demanding audio, video and data
communications needs of business and homes.

For these purposes, the BJP Government will take the following
steps:

1. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 will be replaced with new
legislation that takes into account the advances in the last
century and more and reflects the current and future status
of the telecom sector;

2. The Government's role will be that of a regulator, so the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India will be strengthened;

3. The department of telecom will be converted into a
company called India Telecom. To expedite the shift from
a Government department to a profit-making company,
the Government will divest a portion of its shareholdings
in India Telecom at the appropriate time;

4. The Government will not discriminate between Government-
owned companies or the new private companies coming
into operation. All restrictions (inter-circle, long-distance,
international) will be removed on schedule, or earlier, in
the interests of greater competition;

5. However, the Government will maximize the returns from
the companies that it already owns (India Telecom, VSNL,
MINL, ITI). To make these telecom companies competitive,
they need to have the freedom to hire the best people and
pay them market salaries. These companies will be given
this freedom;

6. Since India is expected to have the sixth-largest number

Untitled-10 175 11/7/2016 11:19:29 PM

176 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

of phones in the world in the next few years, it must have
a telecom-manufacturing industry to match this. The
Government will encourage the creation of world-class
telecom-manufacturing in India, that is encouraged to use
indigenously developed technology; and,

7. The Government policy for foreign direct investment will
discourage foreign majority holdings in telecommunication
companies.

The BJP’s Approach to the WTO

1. The major task facing our country in the economic sphere
is the preservation of a measure of autonomy in the
management of the national economy, which the Congress
Government surrendered meekly by accepting without
resistance the highly prejudicial WTO conditionalities. The
Government should have the sovereign and inalienable
right to choose its economic system as well as its legal,
social, cultural and political system in accordance with its
historic traditions, national genius and the express will
of its people. This would be the foremost objective of our
party to restore the desired autonomy.

2. Agriculture, which concerns the bulk of our people and,
in particular, WTO issues connected with subsidies,
fertilizers and seeds so that the interests of the farmer and
consumer of food are not sacrificed would be adequately
examined. No legislations concerning agriculture and
commitments under the Uruguay Round would be allowed
to be implemented without full democratic discussion.

3. The small-scale sector, which is the backbone of our
economy and employment would not be exposed to
unequal competition, both from large houses in the country
and from the transnational corporations from abroad. The
small-scale sector would be strengthened.

4. The agreement on services, particularly financial services,
would be monitored in respect of the entry of powerful
foreign interests in our country. The immigration laws
abroad should also not confuse rights of the developed
countries for effective opportunities for our people in those
countries.

Untitled-10 176 11/7/2016 11:19:29 PM

Election Manifestoes * 177

5. The patent system, in particular, would not be allowed
to become an import monopoly and working of a patent
and dissemination of technology would be ensured by
an effective and strong ‘license of right’ and ‘compulsory
license’ regime.

6. The BJP would strive to work out a strategy and consensus
within the nation and with all nations similarly placed
to lobby for legitimately justified modification of the
perspective, programmes, rules and schedule of the WTO.

Social Infrastructure
A Better Standard of Living is Every Indian’s Birthright

DESPITE various programmes launched at various points of time
and although food production has touched 195 million tonnes from
a low of 50 million tonnes in 1951, India still loses 11 per cent of
under five children and 3 to 4 per cent women in the reproductive
age group due to malnutrition. It is a reflection of the performance
of previous Governments that 53 per cent of the country’s children
aged under five are malnourished. India has an abysmal record of
28 per cent low birth weight babies. Fifty per cent of the population
suffers from iron deficiency and 20 per cent of all maternal deaths
are due to anemia. To wipe out these shameful figures, the BJP will:
1. Ensure household food security commensurate with the
national food security so that all families in rural and
urban areas get two square meals a day by the year 2003;
2. Review and vigorously implement the National Nutrition
Policy and the Plan of Action on Nutrition so that all goals
are achieved by their target dates;
3. Revamp and expand the scope of Integrated Child
Development Services; and,
4. Use the PDS effectively to help the poorest of the poor.

Housing for All: A New Habitat Policy

THE BJP recognizes that soon one-third of India’s population
will be living in urban centres. It is important to ensure planned
development of these centres from small towns to the big cities
and the large metropolises. Urban slums are rapidly developing
and conditions in them deteriorating. Particularly important are
the problems of drinking water, sewage and waste disposal in

Untitled-10 178 11/7/2016 11:19:29 PM

Election Manifestoes * 179

urban centres. There is a severe shortage of housing both in the
urban and rural areas. For us, shelter is a basic human need that
must be met at all cost. Extensive housing schemes also generate
employment. Therefore, the BJP will:

1. Evolvea National Housing and Habitat Policy in consultation
with State Governments and Urban Development
Authorities. The policy will aim at providing shelter to
all by year 2010 and also facilitate the construction of 20
lakh new houses each year;

2. Review the provisions of the Urban Land Ceiling Act and
ensure that land and property prices do not escalate as
they have in the past;

3. Promote affordable mass housing for low and middle-
income groups;

4. Make available adequate credit to house-seekers on
attractive terms;

5. Take steps to make additional rented accommodation
available; and

6. Launch special concessional schemes to provide rural poor
with adequate and affordable housing.

Health for All
OUR goal will be ‘Health for All’ by 2003, but the poor and
disadvantaged will be a special responsibility. Health delivery is
most effective when decentralized to State, district and local levels,
with communities taking leadership and responsibility for health
and development. In this context, our ancient and local wisdom is
of greatest importance. Public health cannot be regarded as only a
consumer of resource. It is essential for the creation of a good society
with high productivity. It is an investment in human resources.
Towards this end, we will strive for:
1. Clean drinking water in all villages and slums;
2. Attaining 100 per cent universal immunization of children
against preventable diseases;
3. Vigorously attacking eradicable diseases like yaws, leprosy
and filariasis;
4. Promoting awareness on cleanliness, sanitation and disease
prevention;
5. Emphasizing prevention of diseases and maintenance

Untitled-10 179 11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM

180 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

of health which has been the basis of Indian culture and
canalizing resources based on this philosophy;

6. Promoting traditional and alternative systems of
medicine such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Homeopathy,
Naturopathy, with particular emphasis on traditional
wisdom and indigenous knowledge, with full quality
assurance;

7. Safeguarding traditional medical knowledge and natural
resources;

8. Spending more on pre-natal and post-natal health care
programmes and thus drastically reducing India’s infant
mortality rate and under-five mortality rate;

9. Launching an attack through existing programmes relating
to AIDS, tuberculosis and vector borne diseases like
malaria, dengue haemorrhagic fever and kalaazar, with
special attention to elimination of shortfalls/ deficiencies
in implementation;

10. Introducing health impact assessment in all development
projects;

11. Ensuring that essential drugs are available at affordable
prices;

12. Introducing low-cost health insurance schemes;

13. Providing concessional health care for the aged;

14. Instituting a mechanism to monitor and collate health-
related information and ensure timely intervention through
surveillance;

15. Providing every panchayat with a free and truly functional
basic healthcare centre, particularly with facilities for
mother and child care; as well as access to these centres;

16. Making the screening of blood at blood banks mandatory
and provide for punitive punishment for any violation;
and,

17. Making doctors, para-medical and non-medical staff at
Government and private hospitals and healthcare centres
accountable by suitable law.

Education for All

It is sad that fifty years after independence, the cherished

goal of universal primary education enshrined in the

Untitled-10 180 11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM

Election Manifestoes * 181

Constitution, which was to have been implemented by 1960,
yet remains to be achieved. In recent years, State support for
education has been wholly inadequate. Quality education is
fast becoming the preserve of the social and economic elite of
the country. We hold that education is both a human right and
a means to bring about transformation to a dynamic, humane,
thinking society. Towards this end, the BJP will:

1. Increase State spending on education progressively to six
per cent and more of our Gross National Product within
five years;

2. Achieve near complete functional literacy in five years,
particularly by mobilizing societal participation and full
literacy by the year 2010.

3. Launch a nationwide Educational Quality Improvement
Campaign covering all institutions from primary schools
to universities;

4. Accord priority to free primary education and enroll the
help of locally-funded non-government organizations
in this area; also integrate early childhood care and pre-
primary education with primary education;

5. Offer incentives in the form of free text books, mid-day
meals and nutrition programmes and stipends to check
dropout rate so that at least 80 per cent children, both boys
and girls, who enroll, complete primary school education;

6. Introduce self-employment oriented vocational training
programmes at high school level which will also be open
to working youth interested in skill upgradation;

7. Introduce an anti-cheating law which will be applicable
to all States and whose abuse will be prevented through
adequate safeguards; ensure that examinations are held
on time;

8. Set up a special monitoring authority to scrutinize the
quality of education and remove gender disparity;

9. Ensure autonomy to universities and to colleges under

10. Restore to teachers self-esteem and make teaching a
respectable profession;

11. Create centres of educational excellence in our academic
system that can set an example and build self-confidence.
Our Government will select 10 to 20 centres of higher
learning and research that will be supported in all manner
to make them world class;

12. Take the help of industry to set up more agro-industrial
and technical institutions that will provide affordable
education;

13. Replace the system of capitation fees by loan linked schemes
and monitor the functioning of private engineering and
medical institutions;

colleges and institutes to open branches in India and
prevent the outflow of foreign exchange on studies abroad
unless the course is relevant to our needs and requirements;

16. Provide specialized opportunities for highly talented
students at school level;

17. Introduce agriculture studies as a subject in rural schools;

18. Ensure that traditional knowledge and skills are preserved
and disseminated;

Our Agriculture, Our Farmers,
Our Villages

Revitalized Rural Economy, Revitalized National Economy

AGRICULTURE sustains 71.4 per cent of the nation’s population. It
is the mainstay of India’s economy and culture. India is blessed with
every natural resource needed for sustaining a strong agricultural
economy. We have vast cultivable land, ample sources of water,
forests and most importantly, year-long tropical sunlight. We have a
large agricultural human resource that has inherited a rich and hoary
tradition in farming. It has also acquired the tools of modern science
and technology. The combination of these two resources could have
transformed Free India into a continental granary. But fifty years
of neglect, corruption and wrong policies by successive Congress
and quasi-Congress Governments have severely handicapped the
Indian farmer and the entire rural economy. ‘Villager is the salt of
Indian earth,’ said Mahatma Gandhi. ‘Jai Kisan’ said Lal Bahadur
Shastri. But in the last five decades, a majority of our kisans have
become poor and harried outcasts in their own country, with no
respectful place in the Governments’ scheme of things. Today
they are on the margins of India’s economic, social, cultural and
political life.

Rural India and Urban India Complement and Supplement Each
Other

THE BJP is of the considered view that India will not become
a strong, prosperous and confident nation until and unless there
is a qualitative improvement in our rural economy and the
condition of our kisans. In the absence of any comprehensive and
enlightened agricultural policy, the Congress Governments made

Untitled-10 183 11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM

184 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

no attempt either to ensure remunerative prices for farmers based
on a scientific assessment of all the input costs or to bring about a
rational balance between the prices of agricultural and industrial
products. Institutional credit and marketing support for the Indian
kisan was deliberately kept weak and unreliable. As a result, the
hardworking Indian kisan was pushed into poverty and the vicious
clutches of debt. Newspapers have reported about ‘serial suicides’
by farmers in Andhra Pradesh. In 1950-51, the ratio between per
capita rural and urban income was 1:2. Today, it has become 1:4.

The BJP believes that the one-fourth urban India cannot have
balanced development without the rapid development of the
three-fourths rural India. Hence, rural India is not antagonistic,
but complementary and supplementary to urban India.

BJP’s Agenda for Reinvigorating Rural India

¢ The BJP attaches the highest priority to ensuring India’s
food security and to the crying need to rid India of the
scourge of hunger. Towards the goal of creating a hunger-
free society, our Government shall appeal to Indian kisans
to double food production by the year 2010 and pledges
all support for the realization of this objective.

¢ The BJP pledges to reverse the process of economic, social
and political marginalization of India’s rural population
and effectively fight the elitist, anti-kisan Congress mindset,
which engendered this process.

¢ The BJP is committed to restore agriculture to its proper
place in the national economy and re-establish, before the
close of the first decade of the next century, India’s farmers
as a strong and self-confident community enjoying the
fruits of prosperity and social justice.

¢ We shall take all the necessary steps to vastly increase
both public and private investment in agriculture and
agro-based industries, with the aim of harnessing its
full potential for rural wealth generation and productive
employment generation. In this, our priority will be the
small and medium farmers and small-scale industries and
businesses.

¢ Transfer of technology and development of appropriate
technology has become a matter of great urgency

Untitled-10 184 11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM

Election Manifestoes * 185

for the revitalization of the rural economy. We shall
support all initiatives to make agriculture knowledge-
intensive, drawing on both ancient and modern farm
techniques.

Jai Kisan: Our Commitments to the Farm and Rural sector
Earmark 60 per cent of Plan funds in the budget for
agricultural and rural development.

Untitled-10 185

1.

Make a quantum increase in Governmental and private

investment in improving the rural infrastructure

of irrigation, all-weather roads, transport, power,
telecommunication and credit and financing facilities.
Substantially increase Governmental and private investment
in strengthening the social infrastructure in rural areas
in the fields of drinking water, education, health-care,
sanitation and housing.

Through a massive plan of rural housing, the goal of
‘Shelter for All’ will be achieved by the year 2010. At least
half the task will be sought to be achieved in the next five
years.

. Give all possible support to increasing milk production

and animal husbandry. Priority will be given to setting
up milk processing and milk product manufacturing units

close to the catchment area.
To make agriculture sustainable for even the smallest
farmer, the following initiatives will be taken:

(a)

(b)
(c)

Remunerative prices for the entire range of agriculture
produce by linking them to input costs. Towards this
end, our Government will constitute an Agriculture
Costs and Prices Commission. Two-thirds of its
members will be agriculturists and farm experts.
The Commission will be an autonomous body and
its recommendations will be mandatory. It will also
recommend ways of achieving a balance between the
prices of agricultural produce and industrial goods
and services.

In the interim, support price for farm produce to be
linked to the general price index.

To help the farmers through a number of governmental

11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM

186 * Party Document Vol-1

and cooperative schemes to reduce per acre production
cost.

(d) To help the farmers through a number of governmental
and cooperative schemes to increase per acre farm
productivity. Towards this end, attractive incentives
will be instituted for those who achieve exceptionally
high standards of productivity.

(e) To reduce the dependence on primary agriculture
production by encouraging profitable ancillary
activities.

(f) To begin a nationwide crop and animal husbandry
insurance scheme to cover all farmers.

7. Allow free movement of foodgrains throughout the country.

8. Unveil a comprehensive policy for bringing waste and
barren land into productive agriculture or agro-forestry
use. Private sector companies will be encouraged to invest
in this activity, provided individual farmers and village
cooperatives are given substantial share in the equity
holding.

9. Give anew thrust to social forestry, horticulture, vegetable
growing, floriculture, sericulture, mushroom farming.

10. Encourage inland fisheries, piggeries and bee-keeping.

11. As part of acomprehensive National Agri-business Policy,
help setting up of value-addition chains to link production,
preservation, transportation, processing, packaging and
marketing. This policy envisions the participation of the
individual agriculturist not only as a primary producer
and supplier, but as a shareholder who will benefit from
profits generated at every stage of the value chain.

12. Vastly expand the network of warehouses and mandis
(market yards). Our policy will make it mandatory for
the mandis to pay 80 per cent of the price as an interim
payment at the time of delivery of the farmer’s produce.

13. Delicense the sugar industry and decontrol the price and
movement of molasses.

14. Encourage co-generation of power, as also production of
a wide variety of sugar-based by-products at all the sugar
mills in India.

15. Continue subsidy on fertilizers.

Untitled-10 186 11/7/2016 11:19:30 PM

Election Manifestoes * 187

16. Set up a vast network of easily reachable farmers’ service
centres and expand the scope of extension programmes.

17. Make comprehensive documents available to farmers
giving land records, ownership and all other relevant
information. Our Government will also promote rapid
computerization of these records.

18. Reform land acquisition laws with the following objectives:
(a) Farmers should get prompt and full compensation for
his land at market rates; (b) Farmers who have to part
with their land for industrial or urbanization projects
should also be made shareholders in these projects; and
(c) If any public or private sector agency which acquires
farm land for a particular project fails to execute it within
a specified period, the Government will take it back from
the promoters.

19. Boost export of agriculture goods, especially processed
goods, in a big way. Imports will be kept to the bare
minimum and that too if warranted by extraordinary
circumstances. In both export and import of farm goods,
the interests of Indian kisans will be given the highest
consideration.

20. Bolster efforts to increase productivity in dryland farming.

21. Re-orient agricultural planning on the basis of agro-
climatic zoning of the entire country to fully harness the
natural benefits of land fertility and ecosystems for specific
agricultural produce.

Our Steps to Provide Irrigation Facilities

1. Double the area under irrigation in ten years through
optimal use of small, medium and large projects. Priority
will be given to small and minor irrigation projects with
local investment and management participation.

2. Complete ongoing irrigation projects within a specified
period and launch new projects ona firm, time-bound basis.

3. Encourage the use of alternative sources of irrigation
through incentives and better water management.

4. Give attractive incentives for the popularization of drip
irrigation and sprinkler irrigation systems.

5. Ensure that farmers are made to pay only for the water

Untitled-10 187 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM

188 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

they consume.

6. Draw up a master plan for flood control and harnessing
of flood waters for irrigation. Offer prompt compensation
for crops lost in floods.

7. Take effective steps to raise the ground water level.

Check waterlogging, salination and soil erosion.

9. Institute a Regional Water Corporation to plan and increase
water supplies.

%

Our Steps to Revive Village Industry
1. Establish an extensive chain of small-scale, tiny and cottage
industry units.
2. Give the greatest impetus to this sector by provision of
easy and adequate credit at low interest rates.
3. Create new marketing opportunities and facilities for rural
artisans and craftsmen.
Set up a National Artisan Development Bank.
Set up special institutes for skill upgradation.
Give attractive incentives for bio-gas units.
Create weekly mandis in towns and cities in which
villagers and artisans can sell their products directly to
urban consumers.

ND Oe

Our Steps to Provide Power for Agriculture

1. Accelerate total rural electrification so that no village is
left without power in the next five years.

2. Ensure adequate and reliable supply of quality power for
agricultural activity.

3. Set up small power stations and sub-stations in rural areas
for supplying power exclusively to villages.

4. The frequent breaking down of transformers and
distributors in rural areas causes havoc with agricultural
operations. SEBs, though, don’t have the money to replace
these assets. The Government will encourage farmers (and
other users) to form cooperatives to install, maintain and
charge for these rural electrical equipment. Loans from the
Rural Electrification Corporation will be given for this.

Untitled-10 188 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM

Election Manifestoes * 189

Our Steps to Strengthen the Rural Cooperative Movement

1. To unveil a National Rural Cooperatives Policy which
will review the working of the cooperative sector so far,
simplify rules and regulations governing the functioning
of cooperative societies and introduce necessary reforms
to bring this sector in line with the reforms in the rest of
the national economy.

2. The policy will also recommend measures to promote
the cooperative movement in States where it is weak and
ailing.

3. Free cooperatives from political and bureaucratic
interference.

4. Take effective steps to eliminate corruption and nepotism
in cooperative bodies.

5. Ensure that rural cooperatives are not only commercially
viable but also promote equity and social justice.

6. Make entry in passbooks mandatory for all money deposits.

7. Only those entirely dependent on agriculture will be
allowed to become members of farmers’ cooperative
societies.

8. Ensure free, fair and timely elections to cooperative bodies.

9. Encourage collaboration between the cooperative sector
and the corporate sector in the areas of marketing,
manufacturing, technology transfer, mobilization of
investible resources and exports. All necessary measures
will, however, be taken to ensure that the interests of small
and medium farmers are not only protected but promoted
by such collaborative ventures.

10. The BJP will enact the long-pending Multi-State Cooperative
Act.

11. Multiple and often conflicting laws and agencies governing
cooperative banks and other rural financial institutions
will be streamlined.

Our Steps to Implement Land Reforms

1. Enforce the implementation of land ceiling laws in all
States.

2. Set up designated courts to quickly deal with all land
ceiling disputes and monitoring enforcement of verdicts.

3. Expedite distribution of ceiling surplus land among landless

Untitled-10 189 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM

190 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

farmers.

4. Monitor the use of the distributed land to prevent its
alienation from beneficiaries.

5. Reclaim cultivable land lying fallow.

. Time-bound registration of all lands.

7. Decide ownership rights at the level of Gram Panchayats
without any delay.

a

Our Steps to Improve Rural Education

1. Re-orient education in villages and rural towns to address
the varied needs of agriculture, agro-processing, agri-
services, management and other areas of the rural economy.
Agriculture and related subjects will be specially included
in the curriculum in rural schools.

2. Give a big boost to technical and vocational education as
it is crucial to the development of rural human resources.

3. Set up a chain of Krishi Vidyalayas in each block to enrich
the knowledge content and expertise of young people who
are engaged in farming and farm-related activities.

4. Increase facilities for informal farm education, short-
term courses, seminars, field trips, etc. for the benefit of
practicing agriculturists.

5. Give a major boost to rural R&D by strengthening the link
between agricultural universities and top achievers in the
farming community.

Our Steps to Ensure Cow Protection

THE BJP regretfully observes that, despite Article 48 of the
Constitution, millions of cows and cow progeny are slaughtered
every year, most of them for export, thereby causing irreparable
harm to agriculture and villages. Keeping in view Article 48, the
BJP will:

1. Impose a total ban on the slaughter of cows and cow-
progeny, including bulls and bullocks and prohibit all
trade, including export (state as well as private) in beef.

2. Create a policy that will result in improved cattle breeding.

3. Exempt the income of Goshalas and Pinjrapoles from tax.

The BJP recognizes the fact that from times immemorial,

cow-protection has remained at the basics of Indian culture and

Untitled-10 190 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM

Election Manifestoes * 191

Indian agriculture and it is on the patient back of the cow and its
progeny that the entire structure of Indian agriculture rests. Over
seven crore animals are employed in farming operations in Indian
villages, more than 80 per cent of the rural transport needs are met
by the bullock cart. Our livestock is also an effective protection
against environmental degradation.

Our Foreign Policy

Protecting India’s National Interest

THE end of the Cold War has brought with it hopes of an era of
peace and harmony. We see many welcome new manifestations in
our collective attitudes towards resolving longstanding international
issues of common concern relating to the environment, health,
economic development and conflict resolution.

While the possibilities are immense, some old habits persist.
We see a renewed tendency by some big powers to dominate and
to impose conditionalities to advance their political and economic
interest even if it is detrimental to others. There are also perceived
notions of civilizational conflicts as also spurts in conflicts. This
demands that India’s national interest must be protected and
pursued more vigorously. Our diplomacy must, therefore, be
proactive rather than being merely reactive without sacrificing the
values of peace, equality and cooperation.

In the recent past we have seen a tendency to bend under
pressure. This arises as much out of ignorance of our rightful
place and role in world affairs as also from a loss of national self-
confidence and resolve. A nation as large and capable as ourselves
must make its impact felt on the world arena. A BJP Government
will demand a premier position for the country in all global fora.

The BJP rejects the notion of nuclear apartheid and will actively
oppose attempts to impose a hegemonistic nuclear regime by
means of CTBT, FMCR and MTCR. We will not be dictated to by
anybody in matters of security requirements and in the exercise of
the nuclear option. We will pursue our national goals and principles
steadfastly. Briefly these are:

1. To give India a role and position in world affairs

Untitled-10 192 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM

Election Manifestoes * 193

commensurate with its size and capability;

2. To promote sovereign equality among nations. The BJP
rejects all forms of political and economic hegemonism
and is committed to actively resisting such efforts;

3. To vigorously pursue endeavors for India to become a
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
We believe that the existing arrangements in the UN are
tilted in the favor of certain countries to serve their narrow
interest. We are committed to the reform of the UN;

4. To re-orient Indian diplomacy to our economic and
commercial goals and to ensure that our missions abroad
play a more active and supportive role in meeting these;

5. To ensure greater coordination between the ministries
and agencies responsible for external affairs, defence,
finance, international trade and our external and internal
intelligence;

6. To promote greater regional and civilizational relationship
and strive for Asian solidarity in general and the
development of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation in particular. Integral to this would be
renewed efforts to improve bilateral relationships with all
neighboring countries without any third party mediation
or interference;

7. To have greater interaction with more African nations
and to build ties with our traditional friends like Kenya,
Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe;

8. To place relations with the USA ona more even platform
based on mutual respect, shared values and congruence of
interests. We expect the United States to be more sensitive
to India’s security and economic interests;

9. To further develop the long and traditional relationship
with Russia by increased cooperation in trade, technology,
defence and other security related areas. India and Russia
have many common interests in Asia and we will strive
for greater cooperation to serve them;

10. To strengthen political and economic relations with the
European Unions, ASEAN countries, Japan, South Korea,
South Africa, Iran, the Arab nations, Israel, Central Asian
republics and fellow Commonwealth nations;

Untitled-10 193 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM

194 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

11. To take active steps to persuade Pakistan to abandon its
present policy of hostile interference in our internal affairs
by supporting insurgent and terrorist groups. The BJP
affirms unequivocally India’s sovereignty over the whole
of Jammu and Kashmir, including the areas under foreign
occupations;

12. To improve relations with China by seeking speedy
resolution of the outstanding border problem. Even
while doing so we will seek greater cross-border trade
and cooperation in other areas. We are also concerned
about China continuing transfer of advanced weapons
and technologies to Pakistan as this has a vital bearing
on our ties with China;

13. To support a united Sri Lanka within which the
legitimate aspirations of the Tamil people should be fully
accommodated. The BJP greatly regrets the continuing
bloodshed particularly since the Indian people have long
standing, traditional and fraternal ties with the Sri Lankan
people;

14. To maintain the unique, warm and friendly relations with
Nepal with which India has the closest cultural, religious
and historical ties. We will seek to widen existing areas
of cooperation and also develop new avenues of fruitful
cooperation. We recognize in particular the great scope
for increasing cooperation in the energy and environment
related areas. A BJP Government will seek to resolve all
outstanding issues quickly;

15. To further improve relationship with Myanmar with which
India has a long border and age-old cultural, religious and
historical ties. There is much scope for greater cooperation
in the fields of defence, security, economy and culture;

16. To further consolidate the close and friendly ties between
India and Bhutan;

17. To reinforce the improving relations with Bangladesh.
We however continue to view with concern the unabated
illegal infiltration into India from that country and will
seek the active participation of the Bangladesh authorities
in curbing this; and,

18. To take an active role in seeking an early and peaceful

Untitled-10 194 11/7/2016 11:19:31 PM

Election Manifestoes * 195

resolutions of the internecine Afghan conflict particularly
since its continuance has adverse security implications
for India and the development of trade and economic
cooperation with countries in the region.

The BJP re-affirms its commitment to peace amongst all
nations; to the prosperity of the peoples of the world; and to an
enhanced role for India in world affairs as befits this great and
ancient civilization.

Our Nation’s Security
Suraksha for Country and Citizens

THE nation faces grave challenges to its integrity and security as
never before. The internal and external security environment has
deteriorated sharply in the last decade. The previous Governments
have been found wanting in their efforts and determination to face
these threats and are responsible for this. Since 1991, the country’s
defence budget has been declining in real terms. They have declined
from 3.4 per cent of the GDP in 1989-90 to a mere 2.2 per cent this
year. Successive weak and irresolute Governments have imperiled
national security. There is a mistaken view that there is a conflict
between national security and economic development. But these
two go hand-in-hand. There cannot be economic development
without commensurate security preparation and the reverse, too,
is equally true.

The dimensions and directions of present and future threats
need to be constantly analyzed and evaluated. In the glaring absence
of governmental interest and inter-ministerial coordination, the
mechanisms for this have fallen into disuse. The armed forces have
been ignored in defence policy planning. Misguided bureaucratic
interference has demoralized the higher echelons of the armed
forces and has also had a telling effect on defence preparedness.
The BJP Government will take immediate steps to reverse such
negative trends and establish coordination between the armed
forces and the Government at all levels.

The BJP notes with concern the inadequate pace of defence
research and development despite abundant talent available in
DRDO. Inadequate budgetary support is a major reason for this.
The inordinate delays in the LCA, nuclear submarine and guided

Untitled-10 196 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM

Election Manifestoes * 197

missiles, and other programmes are matters of particular concern.
Our scientists and technologists are second to none and it is lack of
political will and clarity on strategic issues that is the main cause of
the delay. Defence production performance, too, has not been up to
the mark. The performance of defence production units need to be
monitored more closely and brought up to acceptable commercial
and international standards.

A National Commission will study and analyze the trends in
defence technologies and appropriately advise the Government on
the development and induction of advanced weapons.

External Security

THE frenetic pace of military expansion and modernization
by some of our neighbors and the growing pressure and power of
foreign navies in the Indian Ocean compel us to take the state of
our defence preparedness very seriously. We also cannot remain
oblivious to the new developments in weapon technology and
the induction of very advanced conventional weapons systems
in the region by some power. These must be neutralized. We are,
therefore, committed to:

1. Establish a National Security Council to constantly analyze
security, political and economic threats and render
continuous advice to the Government. This Council will
undertake India’s first-ever Strategic Defence Review to
study and analyze the security environment and make
appropriate recommendations to cover all aspects of
defence requirements and organization;

2. Re-evaluate the country’s nuclear policy and exercise the
option to induct nuclear weapons;

3. Expedite the development of the Agni series of ballistic
missiles with a view to increasing their range and accuracy;

4. Increase the radius of power projection by inducting
appropriate force multipliers such as battlefield surveillance
systems and air-to-air refueling;

5. Enhance the traditional and technical capabilities of our
external intelligence agencies and also to increase the
interaction and co-ordination with user departments; and,

6. Place para-military forces in sensitive border areas under
the full control of the Indian Army.

Jai Jawan

THE country is justly proud of its soldiers who constantly
brave the elements, endure extreme hardships and risk their lives
to defend the nation. Service in the armed forces must be made
attractive for young people and must be considered a honour.
Consequently:

1. The BJP Government will take measures to make
employment in the armed forces more rewarding and
secure for soldiers greater respect of society;

2. The BJP Government will suitably improve living and
service conditions and expeditiously rectify existing
anomalies;

3. The BJP Government will recognize the services and
sacrifices of retired personnel and attend to their problems
immediately;

4. The BJP Government will increase the benefits and
compensation to widows and dependents of service
personnel who die in action;

5. The BJP Government will be committed to increasing
avenues of lateral induction into other security forces and
other Government departments/undertakings/agencies
for retired officers and jawans; and,

6. The BJP Government will appoint a committee to examine
the question of retirement age at different levels in the
armed forces and make appropriate recommendation to
this effect.

Internal Security

THE BJP will give utmost attention to security-sensitive areas
in the North, the North-East and the South. The BJP Government
will review the role and performance of the police organizations
and take urgent steps to revitalize them. We recognize the need
for the permanent cadre officers in CPO’s to have greater avenues
for advancement.

The BJP Government will ensure far greater co-ordination
between the armed forces, police organizations and the administration
in areas beset with insurgency and terrorism. Armed insurgents
and foreign mercenaries will be eliminated. Our security forces will

Untitled-10 198 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM

Election Manifestoes * 199

be given a free hand to deal with armed insurgency and terrorism.
The BJP Government will revamp the intelligence agencies to
enhance their effectiveness and ensure greater coordination with
security and police forces.
Central and State Police Forces will be reorganized and
modernized while simultaneously improving working and living
conditions of their personnel.

Jammu and Kashmir

WE welcome the restoration of an elected Government in
the State. The BJP Government will take suitable measures for
establishing a durable peace in the State to promote progress
and prosperity. Repeated massacres of Hindus in Kashmir show
that unless the State Government takes the business of curbing
militancy seriously, durable peace will be hard to achieve. The BJP
Government will strive for a more structured coordination between
the Central forces and the State Government.

North-East

THE conditions in the North-Eastern States continue to be
disturbed. The situation in Assam in particular has worsened
in the last few years. It is the Congress Party’s manipulative
and corrupt politics that have contributed most to this. Poor
governance, corrupt and callous administration, the flow of
narcotics and foreign interference have together contributed
to the rapid deterioration of the law and order situation. The
unchecked and unabated illegal infiltration from Bangladesh has
been the single largest causative factor in destabilizing the region.
The spread of heroin addiction and HIV infection in some States
is cause for utmost concern.

The BJP will give socio-economic problems of this region
high priority as lack of development has helped anti-national and
separatist elements in their attempt to foment disaffection. We
believe development is one of the effective antidotes against such
attempts.

The distance between this region and Delhi has further
heightened their sense of alienation. Nothing has been done in
the past 50 years to bridge this physical and emotional distance.
The BJP commits itself to forging new and strong economic and

Untitled-10 199 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM

200 * Party Document Vol-1

emotional bonds between the North-East and the rest of India.

Therefore, we propose to do the following in the North-East:

1. Draw up and implement a comprehensive development
programme, focusing on basic communications
infrastructure like roads, railways, bridges and air link;

2. Harness the immense hydro-electric potential in the region
both for rapid development of these States as well as for
augmenting the power supply of eastern States, thus
enabling the North-East region to mobilise additional
resources;

3. Put into place effective checks and balances to prevent
seepage of development funds which should reach the
people of the region and not be pocketed by a corrupt
few.

4. Strengthen the North-Eastern Council to effectively oversee
and speed up the social and economic development of the
region.

5. The security apparatus will be strengthened to check
infiltration, stem the flow of narcotics and weapons and
eliminate insurgents;

6. Provide all citizens in the region with identity cards;

7. It will strengthen the North-Eastern Council to effectively
oversee and speed up the social and economic development
of the region;

8. Repeal the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunal
Act (IMDTA) and strengthen existing immigration laws
and rules; and,

9. Enact new laws and rules to make illegal infiltration
difficult and deny the extension of benefits of citizenship
to such entrants.

Illegal Infiltration

THE Congress and United Front Governments for their own
narrow and selfish reasons have been deliberately negligent of this
problem. The total number of illegal infiltrators from Bangladesh
is officially ascertained at over 1.7 crore. The adverse impact of
this on our economy and social and political order poses problems
of grave magnitude. This cannot be allowed to continue. Our
Government will:

Untitled-10 200 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM

Election Manifestoes * 201

1. Take more stringent measures to intercept illegal infiltrators
and turn them back. Fencing of the border wherever
possible will be urgently taken up. Border patrolling will
be intensified;

2. Initiate steps to detect illegal infiltrators and delete their
names from electoral rolls; and,

3. Maintain a national register of citizens.

The BJP has the vision and the political will to transform India
into a prosperous and powerful nation in the initial decades of the
next century. A strong and secure India is an essential requisite
for this.

Our Social Philosophy

Rooted in Integral Humanism

THE Bharatiya Janata Party’s social agenda flows from
its ideology of Integral Humanism. Our ideology rules out
contradictions between society and its very components, as also
between society and the individual. Our concern for the last man in
the last row is as deep as that for the first man in the first row, if not
more. The BJP’s concept of social justice, therefore, does not seek to
create rifts and schisms between various sections of society, but aims
at removing social and economic disparities that have resulted in
denial of a share in power, impoverishment and erosion of human
dignity. An ideal society is not one that is compartmentalized in
segments, but is an integral whole, harmonious and conflict-free.
Hence, we subscribe to Samajik Samarasata (social harmony) and
Samajik Nyaya (social justice) and strive to avoid social strife.

Equal Rights for all in Satta (power), Sampatti (prosperity) and
Samman (dignity)

1. The BJP will actively promote a casteless socio-economic
order that will effectively provide access to equal
opportunity for all citizens, irrespective of their caste,
creed, religion and gender.

2. The BJP will, if necessary through legislation, dismantle
practices, customs, beliefs, usages and institutions, which
in any manner hurt the dignity of an individual.

3. The BJP will ensure that the place of an individual in
society is not determined on the basis of his/her birth.

Election Manifestoes * 203

Untouchability: A Crime Against Humanity

1. The BJP will remove the last vestiges of untouchability,
which we believe is an unpardonable crime against
humanity.

2. The BJP will strive to inculcate an ethos of equality in
social and inter-personal relationships.

3. A befitting National Memorial in honour of Dr. Babasaheb
Ambedkar, who dedicated his life to the cause of social
justice, will be erected at Chaityabhoomi in Mumbai on
the lines of national memorials like Raj Ghat, Shanti Van
and Vijay Ghat.

Our Commitment to the Welfare of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes

NEARLY four-and-a-half decades of Congress rule and the
recent UF regime have failed to empower the Scheduled Castes
and the Scheduled Tribes. While thousands of crores have been
spent, ostensibly for their welfare, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes face increasing impoverishment and marginalization. Eighty
per cent of members belonging to these sections of Indian society
have been pushed below the poverty line. The BJP is committed to
the social, economic and political empowerment of the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes, so that the wrongs of the past are
corrected in a time-bound manner for a better future. To fulfill
our commitment, we will be guided by a policy whose highlights
are as follows:

1. Existing institutions and Constitutional safeguards
for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes will be
strengthened and made operationally more effective.

2. The provision of special facilities and preferential
opportunities, including reservations, will be implemented
ina manner so as to benefit the broadest cross-section and
largest number of SCs and STs.

3. The reservations policy will be backed up with a statute
and all backlogs will be cleared within a specified time-
frame. Special tribunals will be set up under CAT to
expeditiously deal with complaints of non-implementation
of the reservations policy and related grievances.

4. All cases of atrocities against members of the Scheduled

Untitled-10 203 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM

204 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

Castes and Scheduled Tribes will be promptly inquired

into and the guilty punished through special courts.

5. Acomprehensive development package will be introduced
for the economic empowerment of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes. The highlights of this package will
include:

(a) Setting up of a credit agency on the lines of NABARD
to meet individual and institutional credit needs;

(b) Vocational training, skill upgradation and financial
assistance to encourage greater participation in
cottage and rural industries and other means of self-
employment;

(c) Food-for-education schemes to raise literacy levels;

(d) A comprehensive national programme of minor
irrigation facilities for irrigable land held by SCs and
STs;

(e) Endowing every landless rural family of the SCs and
STs with land and ensuring sustenance level of income
through requisite facilities;

(f) Amending the existing forest policy to provide Vanvasis
their rightful share of minor forest produce;

(g) Processing claims of Vanvasis and Girijans for pattas
in forest and hill areas promptly; and,

(h) Separate development plans for tribals living in the
plains.

6. The specified allocation for the Special Component Plan (17
per cent) for Scheduled Castes and the Tribal Sub-Plan (8 per
cent) for Scheduled Tribes within the total Plan allocation
will be strictly followed both at the Centre and in the States.
Every effort will be made to ensure that allocated funds do
not lapse and are spent as per Plan provisions.

7. The pernicious practice of carrying night soil will be
eliminated and all those engaged in scavenging rehabilitated.

8. Allotment of pattas for land, home site and homes in the
names of wives/widows/ daughters. These will be properly
drawn up and handed over to actual beneficiaries;

9. Unifying the Banjaras under a common category and
ensuring that they are benefited by the Minimum Needs
Programme;

Untitled-10 204 11/7/2016 11:19:32 PM

Election Manifestoes * 205

10. Necessary steps to stop the exploitation of tribals by
contractors and to free them from indebtedness. We will
consider enacting a law whereby the outstanding debts
of those tribals who have paid back the principal amount
and 50 per cent of the capital as interest, will be written
off;

11. Stringent action to prevent tribal land alienation through
conversion of tribal land for industrial and other purposes;

12. A National Policy for the ‘total rehabilitation’ of families
displaced by development projects. The policy will include
social, economic, educational, environmental, occupational
and cultural aspects;

13. An engineering and a medical college will be set up
in the national capital in honour of Maharishi Valmiki
and Babasaheb Ambedkar. Fifty per cent seats in these
institutions will be reserved for students from Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs;

14. Panchayat institutions in scheduled areas and tribal areas
will be made effective and functional in the light of Bhuria
Committee’s recommendations;

15. Claims for inclusion into the ST list by erstwhile ‘criminal’
tribes and others will be entrusted to a commission for
recommendations.

Our Commitment to the Welfare of Socially and Educationally
Backward Classes

THE BJP is committed to ensuring social and economic justice
to the Other Backward Classes. This is integral to our concept of
Social Harmony (Samajik Samarasata). We reject the divisive and
casteist politics of our adversaries that have neither economically
empowered the bulk of the OBCs nor reduced their educational
backwardness. We propose to:

1. Continue with the current reservations policy for the Other
Backward Classes till they are socially and educationally
integrated with the rest of society;

2. Provide training, financial support and management
facilities for upgradation of skills in traditional industries
and professions of OBCs;

3. Take corrective and remedial measures in view of recent

Untitled-10 205 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM

206 * Party Document Vol-1

macro-economic policy decisions that have rendered
several sections of people belonging to the OBCs jobless;
and,

4. Make the National Backward Classes Finance Development
Corporation fully operational.

Our Commitment to Minorities: Towards Equal Opportunity
and Prosperity
THE BJP’s concept of Positive Secularism is: Justice for All,
Appeasement of None. In the name of ‘secularism’, the Congress and
the United Front parties have shamelessly pandered to communalism
and indulged in ‘vote-bank politics’. As a result, members of the
minority communities have been reduced to nothing more than
numbers to be played with at the time of elections. While these
parties have gained, the minorities have lost —as also has India. The
minorities have been cynically used for the purpose of garnering
votes these past 50 years, but their socio-economic problems have
remained unattended. The true meaning of ‘secularism’, equal
respect for all faith—sarva panth samadar—has been perverted by
the pseudo-secularists into appeasement of regressive elements.
The coming election provides a window of opportunity to
the minorities to take a fresh look at the options that are available
to them. They should not go blindly with the so-called ‘secular’
parties that have done nothing to solve their real socio-economic
problems. Instead, they should make a clean break with the past
and support the BJP. The patron-client relationship advocated
by others is different from what we offer—equal rights, equal
opportunities, equal privileges and equal responsibilities. Above all,
we have proved in the States where the BJP is in power that we can
maintain communal peace and harmony; we can ensure security of
life and property; and, we can protect the honour and dignity of the
minority communities. In keeping with this commitment, we will:
1. Provide all minority communities with equal opportunities
for prosperity;
2. Encourage access to education which is the key to social
and economic progress;
3. Give all incentives to artisans, especially those involved
in traditional arts and crafts;

Untitled-10 206 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM

Election Manifestoes * 207

4. Initiate special self-employment schemes and the requisite
training programmes;

5. Launch community programmes for raising the level
of awareness among women members of the minority
communities and providing them with education;

6. Amend Article 30 of the Constitution suitably to remove any
scope of discrimination against any religious community
in matters of education;

7. Entrust the responsibilities of the Minorities Commission
to the Human Rights Commission, thus providing greater
protection to members of minority communities;

8. Set up special courts to try cases of communal violence
and, if necessary, amend existing laws to provide for
exemplary punishment to those inciting or taking part in
communal or sectarian violence. The BJP’s commitment
is to create a riot-free India;

9. Protect wakf properties from being usurped by unscrupulous
individuals and help wakf boards to develop these
properties for the welfare of poor Muslim families; and,

10. Ban job advertisements which require applicants to declare
their religion.

Our Commitment to Kashmiri Pandits
SEPARATIST and sectarian militancy in Jammu and Kashmir
during the late “80s and right up to the mid ’90s resulted in mass
migration from the Valley and other areas in Kashmir. More than
300,000 people, including 250,000 Kashmiri Pandits and Pandits,
and Punjabi and Dogra Hindus, apart from Muslims, were forced
to flee their home and hearth in the Valley by terrorists and
fundamentalists. The BJP promises immediate action to help those
displaced from the Kashmir Valley and other parts of the State.
Towards this end, we propose to:
1. Work with the Jammu and Kashmir Government to evolve
a feasible scheme for the phased return of the displaced
people, especially the Pandits, to their ancient land;
2. Provide all assistance to the Jammu and Kashmir
Government in order to ensure that the displaced people
receive adequate financial assistance, health care, housing,

Untitled-10 207 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM

208 * Party Document Vol-1

education and employment facilities till such time they
are able to return to their land;

3. Evolve a rehabilitation package, including adequate
assistance to rebuild houses that have been destroyed,
that will be an incentive for returning to the Valley; and,

4. Ensure that their security is inno way imperiled after they
have returned to the land from which they were forced
out against their will.

Our Commitment to Human Rights

THE BJP believes that upholding human dignity, ensuring
justice for all and protecting citizens from the tyranny of the State
are integral to India’s ancient traditions and together form the
cornerstone of civil society. A just State is one that is kind but also
firm in dealing with those who seek to undermine the foundations
of a civil society. We will:

1. Make the National Human Rights Commission a more
effective body by providing it with more powers, additional
resources and better infrastructural support;

2. Publicize the findings of the National Human Rights
Commission and take action against those found guilty
on the basis of irrefutable evidence;

3. Inculcate among security forces a greater appreciation of
the need to safeguard innocent citizens from being harassed
in insurgency-affected areas; and,

4. Include the study of human, civil and democratic rights
in school and college curriculum.

5. Prevent foreign interference in the internal affairs of our
country under the guise of monitoring human rights
violations.

Non-Resident Indians

THE BJP believes that Mother India has a special responsibility
towards her children abroad. We will depart from the current
policy of disinterest and disregard for Non-Resident Indians
and actively pursue a policy that will nourish the umbilical link
between all people of Indian origin, wherever they may be, with
their motherland. We propose to:

1. Create conditions conducive to the return of talented
Non-Resident Indians so that they can fulfill their desire

Untitled-10 208 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM

Election Manifestoes * 209

to serve their motherland;

2. Strengthen the economic, social, cultural, emotional and
spiritual links between Mother India and her children
abroad;

3. Re-examine difficulties in granting dual citizenship to
Non-Resident Indians;

4. Mobilize Non-Resident Indians to effectively lobby India’s
case with the Governments and business establishments of
their host country as well as in international fora. In this
context, it would be instructive to study the role of Jews
and Chinese in the USA in mobilizing opinion favorable
to their countries;

5. Encourage Indians living abroad to project their national
identity even while retaining their respective regional and
linguistic identities;

6. Introduce fresh incentives for Non-Resident Indians to
invest in their motherland, like China has done with the
Chinese people living abroad;

7. Play an active role in ensuring job and social security for
Non-Resident Indians working in the Gulf and South-
East Asian countries with special emphasis on preventing
exploitation and providing legal assistance; and,

8. Revitalize the ties between Mother India and people o
Indian origin living in countries like Guyana, West Indies,
Fiji, Mauritius and South Africa.

Nari Shakti

Empowerment of Women

THE BJP believes that true human development cannot take place
without the empowerment of women. It is not enough to talk about
removing discrimination against women and establishing gender
equality. We need to create new mechanisms for the social, political
and economic advancement of women as also to generate social
awareness on gender issues. One such mechanism is empowerment,
including empowerment through enactment of laws. Yet another
mechanism is capacity-building through education and skill
acquisition. The BJP pledges itself to legal and policy level initiatives
to remove discrimination against women and to ensure that their
rights and dignity are not trampled upon. Special emphasis will
be laid on the rights of the girl child. To harness the full potential
of Nari Shakti, the BJP will:

1. Provide free education to women up to graduation, including
professional studies like medicine and engineering;

2. Immediately seek the passage of the Bill reserving 33 per
cent seats for women in all elected bodies, including the
Lok Sabha and State Assemblies;

3. Actively promote the legal and economic rights of women
which must be equal to those of men and not subject to
the debilitating clauses of personal laws;

4. Entrust the Law Commission to formulate a Uniform Civil
Code based on the progressive practices from all traditions.
This Code will:

(a) Give women property rights;
(b) Ensure women’s right to adopt;
(c) Guarantee women equal guardianship rights;

Untitled-10 210 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM

Election Manifestoes * 211

(d) Remove discriminatory clauses in divorce laws;
(e) Put an end to polygamy;
(f) Make registration of all marriages mandatory.

5. Create conditions in society and workplace to ensure equal
opportunities in matters of employment and promotion;

6. Enact and enforce an anti-sexual harassment code;

7. Enforce the principle of equal wages for equal work, both
in the organized as well as unorganized sector;

8. Encourage the introduction of part-time and take-home
job schemes for working mothers;

9. Promote a health-care system, especially in rural areas,
that will focus on the non-reproductive health needs of
women;

10. Provide assistance to single and working mothers and
introduce a forward-looking housing policy for their
benefit;

11. Work with State Governments to establish adequate number
of working women’s hostels and short-stay homes for
destitute women;

12. Make women partners in the management of community
assets and properties in rural areas;

13. Enroll the help of panchayats to set up latrines for women
in rural areas;

14. Expand the scope of the existing micro-credit system
through an enlarged corpus to which both the Union and
State Governments, apart from banks, will make liberal
contributions;

15. Encourage the setting up of cooperative societies in rural
and urban areas to be managed by women for the benefit
of women entrepreneurs;

16. Introduce skill-based training programmes and self-
employment schemes which are area-specific and job-
specific;

17. Design special functional literacy programmes for women
who have been denied access to education;

18. Amend laws that deal with molestation, rape and dowry,
to provide for in-camera trial, swift justice and tough
deterrent punishment as well as rehabilitation of the
victims of these crimes;

Untitled-10 211 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM

212 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

19. Amend the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act to make
clients as culpable as commercial sex-workers;

20. Strictly enforce age of consent laws and launch a vigorous
campaign against child prostitution by making it a
cognizable offense;

21. Establish family courts in residential areas for speedy
disposal of family dispute;

22. Mention of mother’s name will be made mandatory on all
official documents, starting from a child’s birth certificate
to a person’s death certificate;

23. Set up special courts in every district for the expeditious
trial of all civil and criminal cases in which women are
the accused;

24. Rapidly induct more women in the police force and appoint
women to senior positions as well as increase the number
of ‘Crimes Against Women Cells’ so that no police station
area is left uncovered by the year 2003;

25. Enact and strictly implement a special law to deal with
domestic violence against women;

26. Promote a social agenda designed to discourage negative
influences and end discrimination against the girl child
in any form;

27. Strictly enforce the existing laws that prohibit unethical
practices like pre-natal sex-determination tests, female
foeticide and infanticide;

28. Invest in the girl child’s health, nutrition and education,
from infancy through adolescence, by formulating
appropriate programmes and incentive schemes;

29. Universalize primary and secondary education to narrow
the gender gap;

30. Prevent media’s projection of women in any manner that
demeans them or hurts their dignity; and,

31. Set up a national-level apex women’s development bank
on the lines of NABARD and SIDBI. There is need for
setting up a dedicated development bank to cater to the
financing needs of women entrepreneurs and the vast
number of self-employed women.

Our Population Policy

Making it a People’s Movement

THE BJP views India’s runaway population growth with all the
concern it deserves. Expected to hit the one billion mark by the
year 2001, India’s population is set to overtake that of China
unless the growth rate is checked and then reversed. The danger
of a runaway population growth is there for all to see: A rapidly
expanding population means a slower rate at which development
can be effected. While India was one of the first countries in the
world to recognize the need to control the growth of its population
in order to ensure a better distribution of the fruits of development,
successive Union Governments have failed in the implementation
of this important programme. Excesses during the Emergency have
given way to complacence and dangerous negligence. The BJP will
put population-related issues, including family planning, firmly
back on the national agenda. The BJP believes that the country’s
runaway population growth can be arrested and rolled back
through increased awareness, facilitating access to family planning
measures, persuasive Government policies and rapid development.
It is an universally acknowledged fact that ‘development is the best
contraceptive.’ But we realize that Government alone cannot fulfill
this gigantic task. The Government's efforts must be supplemented
by a vigorous people’s movement. In addition, the BJP proposes to:
1. Formulate a National Population Policy by acting on the
reports of the National Development Council and the
Swaminathan Committee. This Policy will seek to bring
the population growth close to stabilization by the year

2010;
2. Provide incentives to those who opt for the ‘two-child’

Untitled-10 213 11/7/2016 11:19:33 PM

214 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

norm and high incentives to those who embrace the ‘single-
child’ norm;

3. Take all measures for reducing infant mortality rates and
improving child health;

4. Promote women’s education, employment and
empowerment since these can be effective means of
population control as they will allow women a decisive
role in regard to their reproductive health and family
planning;

5. Introduce disincentives which will apply to all sections of
society in order to discourage large, unsustainable families;

6. Ensure universal access to family planning information
and quality contraceptive facilities by involving non-
government organizations and promote awareness
among the people, especially women, through counseling,
educational programmes and widest use of modern
multimedia capabilities;

7. Introduce family planning methods and facilities that will
allow women greater freedom of choice without imperiling
their health as well as support research relating to these
methods;

8. Encourage women to seek reproductive health services
as well as launch a special campaign to educate local
communities about negative practices;

9. Offer a special incentive in the form of a fixed deposit that
will mature in 21 years for those couples who have only a
girl child or those who adopt a girl child under a ‘Dattak
Putri Yojana’;

10. Make family planning an integral part of our development
policies to ensure widest applicability of these incentives
and disincentives and provide motivation for a small
family norm; and,

11. Ensure that the legal age of marriage is strictly implemented.

Our Policy for India’s Youth
Yuva Shakti for Rashtra Shakti

OUR youth are the strength of the family, village, locality and
the community. They are also the biceps or triceps of the nation.
They are the most idealistic, inspired and energetic section of
our nation. But in the absence of a driving national vision and a
credible national leadership, their energy has remained dormant or
got misdirected. Today, the youth of India see the BJP with great
hope and we see them with equally great hope as the inheritors of
India in the 21st century.

The BJP recognizes their immense creative potential to effect
positive social, cultural and political changes. We pledge to create
a conducive environment and a supportive policy framework for
the full realization of this potential.

Towards this end, we will unveil a National Youth Policy,
for the implementation of which our Government will set aside
substantial budgetary resources. A permanent National Youth
Commission will be set up to monitor the implementation.

Promotion of a Robust Sports and Physical Culture

SPORTS has been neglected since Independence and the
blame must be shared by both the Government and society. Also
neglected is the development of a hardy physical culture, which
alone provides the necessary basis on which a nation can promote
excellence in sports. It is a national shame that India, the second
most populous country in the world, almost never finds a place in
the medals tally in the Olympic Games. It is a sad commentary on
our sports culture that, in a country of nearly one billion people,
we have not more than 2,000 top-ranking sportsmen and women.

Untitled-10 215 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM

216 * Party Document Vol-1

To promote Indian sports to attain international recognition and
to develop a sports ethos in India, the BJP will:

1. Make physical education and sports coaching compulsory
up to the +2 stage.

2. Make a substantial budgetary allocation for instituting
methods to identify and train sports talent.

3. Look for sports talent outside the educational institutions,
particularly in villages and in coastal areas.

4. Promote traditional Indian sports and, in association with
neighboring countries, make them international sports.

5. The functioning of sports bodies will be immediately freed
from all bureaucratic and political interference.

6. A yearly Rural Sports Meet and (depending on the
concentration of tribal population) a Tribal Sports Meet
will be held in each village, taluka, district and State.

7. With regard to India’s participation in the Olympics and
other international games, a well-conceived, long-term
policy will be evolved to achieve success.

Bharat Punarnirman Vahini

THE BJP Government will unveil a nationwide scheme to tap
the spirit of voluntary service among the youth and channel it for
the realization of twin goals: Self-growth and Nation-building. The
scheme envisages the setting up of a Bharat Punarnirman Vahini,
whose youthful voluntary members will devote one year of their
life for national reconstruction. They will take part in diverse
activities such as rural reconstruction, water maintenance, social
forestry, public health, environment protection, social harmony,
adult literacy and preservation of traditional knowledge systems.
Initially, this scheme will be taken up on an experimental basis in
a few pilot districts from different parts of the country.

Family and Society

Preserving Integrity of the Family

IN the Indian view of life, an individual is not an independent or
sovereign being, but an integral member of the family, community,
the nation and the human race. The basic institution that anchors
the individual in society and the nation, as also links him to the past
and the future, is the family. The BJP believes that the integrity of
the family institution is the main guarantor of India’s civilizational
continuity. Hence, the importance of protection and nurturing of
family values cannot be overstated in the context of nation-building.
If the family is the brick, society is the edifice.

Our Charter for Children: No Child Shall Go To Sleep Hungry

THE BJP believes that children are born—and have the
right—to be happy; they have the right to food, shelter and clothes;
they have the right to education. But the facts as they exist paint a
dismal picture. India has a high infant mortality rate. Many children
suffer from malnutrition and hunger. The majority of them have
no access to education. Deprived of their childhood, millions of
children have to work to feed themselves and contribute to the
family income. Constitutional provisions and legal safeguards have
been followed more in the breach than in practice. There are more
children working in factories and fields than in schools; there are
more children living in deprivation than in secure homes. The BJP,
in keeping with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, will
ensure that the ‘best interests’ of India’s children are taken into
account in all situations. Children’s rights are the foundation on
which better societies can be built and, therefore, we will implement
the Convention on the Rights of the Child in both letter and spirit.

Untitled-10 217 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM

218 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

Towards this end, we will protect:

1. Children’s right to survive and develop to their full
potential;

2. Children’s right to the highest attainable standard of health
care through compulsory health check and by strengthening
the ICDS;

Children’s right to be registered immediately after birth;

4. Children’s right to protection from all forms of sexual
exploitation and sexual abuse;

5. Children’s right to play;

6. Children’s right to education; and,

7. Children’s right to shelter.

As we step into the next millennium, child labour must be
left behind, consigned to history as completely as those other
forms of slavery that it so closely resembles. We will amend the
present Child labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act to remove
the distinction between hazardous and non-hazardous processes.
We will achieve the goal of wiping out the scourge of child labour
in factories and fields through:

1. Regular and persistent inspections by labour departments

at the Centre and in the States;

2. Special annual campaigns to detect child employment;

3. Identity cards which will be mandatory for all young
workers;

4. Welfare benefits, especially social assistance to poor
families, aimed at ensuring a minimum income and thus
removing the need to rely on their children’s labour;

5. Free and compulsory primary education.

No nation has the moral authority to claim prosperity if its
children are hungry. The BJP promises that by the year 2000, no
child who attends primary school will go to sleep hungry. We will
devise a suitable scheme with full community participation to keep
this solemn promise.

Caring for our Disabled

AS many as fifty million Indians are denied the chance
to participate in the nation-building process because of
their physical and other disabilities. Rather than recognize
the contributory potential of these differently abled men

Untitled-10 218 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM

Election Manifestoes * 219

and women, they are socially, economically and politically
marginalized. Successive Congress Governments, as well as
the UF regime which made cynical use of the slogan of ‘social
justice’, have done nothing to empower the disabled. Budgetary
allocation to help the disabled amounts to less than pittance.
Parliament passed a Bill for the welfare of the disabled, but it
is yet to be implemented in both letter and spirit. The BJP will
adopt a holistic approach towards the disabled so that they
are able to contribute their mite to the nation-building process
instead of being condemned to the margins of society. Towards
this end, the BJP will:

1. Conduct a special census to collect accurate data about
the number of disabled people and the nature of their
disability in order to formulate an effective policy;

2. Emphasize on empowerment and development of the
abilities of the disabled into specific skills;

3. Ensure access to public services and public places, to begin
with in metropolitan cities;

4. Provide employment in suitable categories of Government
service through a pro-active ‘equal opportunities’
programme;

5. Offer incentives to the private sector to introduce a similar
‘equal opportunities’ scheme in suitable job categories;
and,

6. Encourage State Governments to set up centres for
counseling and skill acquisition.

Caring for our Senior Citizens
INDIAN family and social traditions have always held elders
in high esteem. A person who attains the status of an ‘elder’ and
a ‘senior citizen’ is looked upon as a repository of experience,
values and wisdom, which need to be transmitted to the younger
generation. Sadly, the alien nature of socio-economic development
in India in the past fifty years has brought the institution of family
under great pressure. One of the worst victims of this process are
our senior citizens.
1. Our Government, in line with the BJP’s philosophy, will
take all possible measures to alleviate the difficulties and
hardships suffered by our senior citizens.

2. We will also support and encourage all societal efforts to
restore the traditional respect and regard for the elders.

3. A person who retires after long years of service does not,
by the very act of retiring, lose his ability to contribute
in his field of expertise. Our Government will prepare a
decentralized database of such skilled and knowledgeable
individuals, so that both Governmental and non-
governmental agencies can use their services.

4. Organizations of senior citizens will be encouraged to
participate in consultative, advisory and, wherever possible,
managerial capacities in the implementation of suitable
Governmental programmes.

Our Policy on Environment
Ecological Security for Sustainable Development

THE BJP believes in the traditional Indian position that Nature
is sacred. The Atharva Veda sets out the principle that Nature is
the mother of humans and that humans owe a responsibility to
maintain the ecological balance. The BJP will ensure institutional
measures to bring about ecological security so that all developmental
programmes are in conformity with the principles of sustainable
development.
It is essential to ensure production with lower inputs of energy,
water, chemicals and at lower costs. This will call for significant
scientific research, new technologies and implementation strategies.
To deal with these critical problems, the BJP Government will:
1. Introduce a National Environment Policy incorporating
a healthy balance between development needs and
preservation of natural resources. The interests of States
and consultation with them will be fully ensured. To
implement the policy, the Ministry of Environment and
Forests will be recast as the Ministry for Ecological Security;

2. Formulate a programme for developing sustainable cities
with special emphasis on urban planning, safe drinking
water, waste management and lowering the use of natural
resources like water through recycling and reduced usage
intensity.

3. Implement better management and harnessing of river

waters as well as sources of ground water;

4. Control land, air and water pollution by industry and

urban centres. Municipal sewage treatment plants will
be made obligatory;

Untitled-10 221 11/7/2016 11:19:34 PM

222 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

5. Revive the faith of the people that Nature is sacred and make
environment studies part of school, college and university
curricula. Also, make environment issues an integral part
of the visual media so that our children develop a caring
and protective attitude towards the ecological system that
sustains our lives;

6. Protect the traditional and other rights of Vanvasis and
Girijans over forest resources and produce;

7. Involve local Self-governments at all levels (panchayats,
nagar palikas and zila parishads) both in villages and
cities, in implementing the National Policy;

8. Provide easy access to information on conservation and
sustainable use of natural resources;

9. Ban the import of hazardous chemical wastes for recycling
by any industry or for dumping;

10. Minimize the use of non-biodegradable material for
packaging by the consumer non-durable products industry;

11. Restrain the conversion of forests or grazing areas for
other purposes;

12. Adopt afforestation policies to be fulfilled within a
given time frame and prevent the degradation of forest
by natural or manmade causes. The cornerstone of the
BJP’s forest policy will be a part of the total framework
of land management, adoption of a dynamic programme
of productive forestry and moving to private investment
in forestry from total State management of forests. A
programme will also be drawn up for conversion of
degraded forests, wasteland and marginal land into quality
forests;

13. Deny exploitation of offshore resources, especially marine
life, by big trawlers;

14. Promote research and development in environment-related
issues and eco-technology for application in agriculture,
industry and the services sector;

15. Provide incentives to manufacturers of eco-friendly
products;

16. Not sanction tourism-related projects that disturb the
environment and cause degradation;

17. A major effort will be mounted to clean up our river

systems and other water bodies;
18. Develop machinery for prevention, integration and
management of national disasters;
19. Encourage energy conserving techniques in all areas o
production.

Our Policy on Science & Technology
R&D for People’s Welfare

THE BJP firmly believes science and technology has a very important
role to play in bringing about sustainable national development and
in transforming India into a prosperous, strong and self-confident
country. The BJP is proud of the achievement and capabilities,
scientific and technological community of the country. The BJP
endorses the basic philosophy outlined in the Scientific Policy
Resolution of 1958 and the Technology Policy Statement of 1983.
The BJP will increase public outlays on scientific research; and also
ensure that the potential of science and technology to improve the
lot of vast sections of our society living below the poverty line and
to bring about a more equitable society is fully harnessed. The BJP
is committed to the urgent need to ensure integration of efforts
in science and technology with the development programmes in
the various socio-economic sectors. The BJP recognizes that while
science and technology has a very important role to play in the
creation of wealth and improving the material conditions of the
society, it is also a vital component in enriching the mind, enlarging
the human spirit and creating a thinking society. Towards this end,
the BJP Government will:

1. Foster scientific mind and attitude among the people, using
all the available powerful techniques of the mass media
and in the various languages of the country; and support
locally-funded non-governmental organizations in their
efforts in this regard;

2. Ensure the use of science and technology in all important
developmental sectors for increasing production and
productivity, efficiency and for generating employment;

development and prepare a national budget for public and
private-sector investment in research and development so
as to increase the outlay on R&D;

7. Introduce effective measures to stimulate a substantial
increase in private investment in industrial research and
development and innovation; and assist in raising capital
for start-up and growth;

8. Provide incentives for formation of regional/local
collaborative networks including ‘Technology Parks’
and for strong linkages involving universities, national
laboratories and industry in research and development;

9. Ensure the creation of a network of centres for application
of science and technology in rural areas, particularly,
for implementation of ‘lab-to-land’ programmes and to
develop a strong low-cost agro-industrial base with focus
on decentralized employment;

10. Create conducive work environment and facilities to
retain the best scientists in the country and enthuse young
scientists to pursue science as a career;

11. Safeguard national interests and our intellectual
development, strengthening the innovation base,
developing patents awareness and related infrastructure;

Our Policy on Information Technology
Making India a Software Superpower

RECENT advances in Information Technology (IT) have enshrined
IT as the most revolutionary tool ever created in known human
history. IT promises to transform every facet of human life and
usher in a knowledge-based society in the next century. It has
already been delivering on some of these promises. The world
of computers, telecommunication, television, the Internet and all
other media is converging very rapidly, shrinking, in the process,
Planet Earth into a Global Village. This has opened up infinite and
previously unimaginable new possibilities in work, education,
communication, commerce, manufacturing, agriculture, services,
health-care, leisure and entertainment. It will influence the working
of our political and democratic institutions, too.

Although India lagged behind in the earlier phases of the
Industrial Revolution due to historical reasons, she has served notice
of soon emerging as a major global IT power. Indian computer
scientists and professionals — both those serving in India and abroad
— have shown with their achievements that they have the potential
to make our country a front-runner in the age of Information
Revolution. The BJP attaches a high priority for accelerating this
process. Specifically, we will do the following:

1. Unveil a National Informatics Policy with a strategic 10-
year perspective to fully harness the benefits of IT in every
sphere of our national life;

2. Create awareness that IT is not a luxury, but the very
backbone of future development;

3. The biggest contribution computers and the Internet can
make is in the field of education. Our IT policy shall strive
to take India towards the goal of universal computer literacy
and Internet access in the shortest possible period;

Untitled-10 227 11/7/2016 11:19:35 PM

228 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

4. Make India a software superpower by giving all-out
encouragement to software companies to grab a large
share of the global market. Our aim is to have software
exports increase by ten times in the next five years;

5. The BJP will endeavour to provide, by the year 2000,
computers and facilities for computer education in all
secondary schools in the country, including those in rural
and remote areas, which otherwise have basic facilities
like a proper building and power;

6. Formulate a bouquet of policy initiatives to support,
within a competitive environment, Indian IT companies
and professionals to rapidly expand the scale of their
operations and to enable them to take the Indian IT flag
all across the globe;

7. Provide broad-band nationwide communication links using
satellites, optical fiber-cables and wireless. No region will
be without this essential IT infrastructure;

8. Ensure the fast nationwide onset of the Internet, Intranet
and Extranet as part of the global and national information
superhighways. These will be evolved to carry mail,
finance and banking, electronic commerce and all other
multimedia communication needs in the shortest possible
time at the least cost;

9. Quickly collect, compile and reformat all official records,
especially those which have a direct bearing on the
country’s economic progress and the average citizen's
interaction with Governmental agencies, into a usable
electronic format;

10. Network, through the Internet, Intranet, Extranet, local
area networks and wide area networks, all limbs of
the Government to facilitate quick, multiway flow of
information amongst ministries, departments and key
administrative functionaries. This will help the Government
work faster, more efficiently and in a more pro-people
manner; and,

11. Facilitate our schools, colleges and universities, in all
possible ways, to harness the rich knowledge resources
available on the Internet to improve the standard o
education.

Our Policy on Media, Cinema, Arts
Freedom with Responsibility

WHILE the BJP believes in the traditional Indian position of Ano
Bhadraha Kritavayo Yantu Vishwataha (Let noble thoughts come to
us from all sides), it equally believes in the Gandhian dictum that
we should keep our windows open for fresh air to come in, but
keep the walls intact, so that we are not blown off our feet. This
is the guiding principle of the BJP in its approach to the media.

Consistent with this, the BJP would enact rules to ensure that
ownership of the media is in the hands of natural-born Indians only.
While, a limited extent of 20 per cent foreign equity investment
may be allowed in the electronic media in view of its large capital
requirements, no investment will be allowed in the other media,
including the print media. On the use of editorial matter from
outside in electronic media, the BJP would ensue that the safeguards
present in Article 19 (2. of the Constitution are fully implemented
to balance freedoms and public interest.

Voluntary Normative Standards for Media

THE BJP believes that, a healthy polity and democracy cannot
survive without the support of an extra-political moral order
which the democratic political order cannot itself impose on its
citizens. This belief is also the emerging belief of more advanced
democracies that are experiencing a steep slide in morality which
is endangering the very idea of orderly society. These decaying
societies are beginning to understand that no society, especially a
democracy, can long endure without the consensus of the majority of
its citizens to some normative moral code. Within the boundaries of
this code, cultural diversity can flourish, outside of which it quickly

Untitled-10 229 11/7/2016 11:19:35 PM

230 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

degenerates into a jungle of conflicting special interests enveloped
in moral chaos.

While the world shrinks, India will have to provide against
such danger in our society too. Fortunately, at the family and social
levels, the age-old ‘dharma’, which is distinct from religious practice,
acts as an extra-political normative moral order. But the normative
moral order or dharma needs to be protected and preserved as it is
already under pressure. With this end in view, the BJP will strive
for a national consensus with the involvement of all sections of
the Indian society for a voluntary moral standard for the media,
for the media plays a very important role both in fostering and
prejudicing such a moral order. The inherent idea behind such a
moral code may be summarized as under:

1. Promotion of family values and extended family
relationships to preserve its character as a basic socio-
economic and socio-cultural unit.

2. The importance of religious faith in moulding human life,
with due understanding that religions should not conflict;
nor should there be uniformity.

3. Projection of regard and respect for women and
motherhood.

4. Criticism of political parties and personalities, without
eroding the self-confidence of the nation.

5. Promotion of interest in Indian traditions, history, literature,
arts and values as a source of emotional support and as a link
with the nation’s past, thus strengthening the civilizational
and cultural roots of the country and its people.

6. Entertainment as an embodiment of the traditional Indian
view of ‘Navarasa’ so that it does not degenerate into a
source of amoral living.

7. Healthy development of an open and scientific mind, the
spirit of adventure and patriotism among the youth.

The BJP will ensure that the rights of free speech of Indian
citizens are guaranteed and will promote the availability throughout
India of a diverse range of radio and television services offering
information, entertainment and education. A BJP Government
will ensure the development of a non-partisan Indian expression
through programmes which, while reflecting Indian attitudes,
opinions, ideas, values and artistic creativity would, at the same

Untitled-10 230 11/7/2016 11:19:35 PM

Election Manifestoes * 231

time, encourage rational thinking, a scientific temper and lead
Indian society to modernity in the 21st century.

This is an indicative and not exhaustive idea on the subject.
The BJP Government will start a nationwide debate on this
concept of a voluntary moral code and strive to evolve a
consensus.

To achieve this goal, we will:

1. Improve the provisions of the Prasar Bharati Act to let
Prasar Bharati organize an effective public broadcasting
system, which would be accountable to Parliament but free
from Government control, immune from political influence
and sensitive to the diverse needs of Indian society.

2. While permitting, by license, the entry of private enterprise
and investment in radio and television broadcasting, purely
on commercially acceptable terms determined by bids, we
will ensure that:

(a) The uplinking of television programmes will be from
India.

(b) Foreign equity investment in audio-visual media is
restricted to 20 per cent.

(c) Management of all types of the media is in Indian
hands.

3. Ensure, by law, that there are appropriate statutory
guidelines for the content of the broadcast in line with
the terms of Article 19 (2. of the Constitution of India.

4. Ensure and encourage the availability of a variety and
plurality of views and diversity in programming by
discouraging monopolies and maximizing the number of
voices, which can use the mass media. We will, therefore,
impose appropriate cross-media and cross-platform
restrictions and also restriction on investment by media
in cable-TV companies and vice-versa.

5. Facilitate the development of an efficient and competitive
Indian broadcasting industry by providing a level playing
field to the nascent Indian industry vis-a-vis a highly
developed foreign-based broadcasting industry.

6. Encourage providers of both public and commercial
broadcasting services to be responsive to the need for
fair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest

Untitled-10 231 11/7/2016 11:19:35 PM

232 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

including matters of local significance and respect
community standards in the provision of programming.

7. Ensure the providers of broadcasting services place a high
priority on the protection of children from exposure to
programmes that may be harmful to them.

8. Ensure the adaptability of the Indian broadcasting system
to scientific and technological change.

9. Create an exclusive ‘Kisan Channel’ in Doordarshan.

10. Establish an independent autonomous public authority
comprising representatives of all sections and interests.
This authority will regulate broadcasting and set up a
system to address complaints.

11. Evolve a strategic plan to strengthen India’s national news
agencies like PTI and UNI to let them become influential
global players in the shortest time.

12. Economic security and social welfare of working journalists
shall be ensured. The Working Journalists Act, 1955 shall
be further strengthened and steps shall be taken for proper
implementation in all media establishments.

13. Freedom of the Press shall be ensured and protected at all
costs.

Cinema

POPULAR cinema has played an important role in promoting
social harmony and nationalism, apart from providing inexpensive
entertainment to the masses. However, in recent years, popular
cinema, increasingly funded by the underworld, has had a negative
impact on society, especially on impressionable young minds. Sex
and violence on the screen are beginning to gnaw at the moorings
of our cultural ethos. The BJP is committed to checking this abuse
of popular cinema. A BJP Government will:

1. Allow movie-makers through suitable provisions in law
to raise resources from financial institutions to curb the
influence of underworld financiers and Mafia dons.

2. We will provide a ‘green channel’ clearance for the
automatic certification of movies that do not have explicit
scenes and dialogues of violence and sex. Producers of
such movies will not have to wait in the queue for Censor
Board clearance. Deterrent punishment will be meted out

Untitled-10 232 11/7/2016 11:19:35 PM

Election Manifestoes * 233

to any movie-maker who abuses this facility and to theater
owners who screen such movies.

3. Exempt quality movies, which will be certified ‘Q’, from
entertainment tax.

4. Encourage viewers to form local Darshak Sanghs — on the
lines of consumer organizations —to monitor the quality
of movies being screened in their area.

5. Set up theaters at all district headquarters and large
population centres for screening art and popular movies.

6. Reserve 50 per cent of the places on the Censor Board and
Censor Panels for women.

7. Create a special fund for promoting regional cinema.

8. Introduce legislation to ensure minimum wages and
retirement benefits for movie artistes and crew.

In the field of performing and literary arts, our broad approach
will be:
1. Preservation, propagation and popularization of our
diverse cultural heritage.
2. Creativity and experimentation.
National integration through arts.
4. Taking arts to the people and bringing people’s arts to
national limelight.
5. Recognition and honour of and support to outstanding

»

persons in creative pursuits.

6. Debureaucratization of arts and culture and freeing them
of excessive Governmental interference.

7. Creation of basic supportive infrastructure for arts and
culture in all the States.

Achievements of Governments in
BJP-Ruled States

THE Bharatiya Janata Party has provided the people with a clean,
efficient and purposeful administration in the States where it is
in power. We have pursued pro-people policies, implemented
programmes that have benefited millions of lives and, above all,
maintained peace and communal amity. Peace and prosperity for
all has been the hallmark of our State Governments in Rajasthan,
Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra (where we share power with
the Shiv Sena), Punjab (where we share power with the Akali Dal)
and Haryana (where we share power with the Haryana Vikas
Parishad). In Uttar Pradesh, although the BJP has been in power
for a few months now, far-reaching decisions have been taken and
action initiated to restore rule of law in a State that had come to
represent ‘jungle raj’ during prolonged Central rule. Attempts have
been made by our adversaries to destabilize these Governments,
but they have failed.

With a firm, but fair hand our State Governments have
cracked down on criminal and anti-national activities. The
criminal-politician-bureaucrat nexus that had emerged during
Congress rule in these States has been smashed. In Maharashtra,
the underworld mafia has been put on the run. Our Governments
have attached significant attention to maintaining law and order,
which has contributed to the economic well-being of the masses.
Complaints of corruption have been vigorously followed up with
impartial inquiries. Prompt action was taken wherever it was called
for without fear or favor.

Special attention has also been paid to the problems of farmers

and socially disadvantaged sections of society. Women’s issues have
been addressed to through innovative schemes. Health, education
and nutrition have been given top priority as these issues affect
the common man the most. All efforts have been made to mobilize
resources for development without burdening the people with
fresh taxes. Infrastructure and job-generating industry have been
the focus of our attention.

We are proud to list some of the salient achievements of our
State Governments.

This Council has been established with the purpose of greater co-
ordination among the BJP-ruled States. The Council also articulates,
from time to time, the aspirations of the States vis-a-vis the Centre.
It has played a major role in formulating fiscal demands of the

Towards a New Culture of National
Consensus and Responsible Citizenry

CONSENSUS-building is an essential part of nation-building.
Cooperation for the larger good of the nation has been a cornerstone
of our civilization. Yet, one of the many baneful contributions of
the Congress Party to India’s post-Independence polity has been
the politics of confrontation and negativism. The BJP believes
that, in a multi-party democracy like ours, constructive dialogue,
consultation and cooperation between the ruling and opposition
parties is, not only desirable, but essential. It has become all the
more necessary since several major national issues confronting
India today cannot be effectively addressed without evolving a
broad platform of national consensus.

Some of the issues where such a national consensus is most
urgently called for are: electoral reforms; Centre-State relations;
population policy; empowerment of women by legislating 33 per
cent reservation for them in all elected bodies; inter-state water
disputes; environmental protection; and effective institutional
guarantees for the welfare of the weaker sections of society in the
course of economic reforms.

Specifically, our Party and Government shall do the following:

1. We shall not practice ‘political untouchability’ vis-a-vis
any party;

2. In all issues of national importance where a national
consensus is needed, we shall adopt a policy of dialogue
and consultation with other political parties;

3. The consultative mechanisms and procedures in Parliament,
towards which the Congress Party always had a casual or
contemptuous attitude, will be revived; and,

Untitled-10 240 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM

Election Manifestoes * 241

4. We shall actively seek the views, suggestions and, wherever
feasible, participation of citizens and organizations outside
the sphere of politics.

An equally important dimension of democracy and nation-
building, which the Congress Party totally neglected in the past five
decades, is the need to build a responsible citizenry. Democracy is
not only about rights, but also about responsibilities and duties.
However, since the rulers themselves threw their responsibilities to
the winds and turned Statecraft into crass commerce and politics into
an unscrupulous power game, the average Indian naturally became
cynical about politics. His awareness about his responsibilities as
a citizen weakened and, to that extent, his conscious contribution
to nation-building also diminished.

As the adage Raja kaalasya kaaranam (The ruler is responsible
for the times) reminds us, the blame for this sad of State of affairs
rests with the Raja and not the Praja. The BJP pledges that, when it
is in power, the people will see a qualitative change in the culture
of governance. There will be a marked change in the mindset and
behavior of those in Government. Their duties and responsibilities
will take precedence over their perquisites.

Though such a change in the culture and content of governance
is the first prerequisite for building a New India, it alone is not
enough. A change in the mindset and behavior of citizens in their
daily lives is also equally necessary for building a strong, prosperous
and proud nation. On the occasion of the Swarna Jayanti of our
Independence, therefore, the BJP makes the following appeal to
every Indian to inculcate the spirit of the Freedom Movement:

1. ‘We, the people of India, shall not discriminate on the
basis of caste, creed, class, gender, language, or region in
any of our actions and decisions in life. Instead, we shall
behave with all our compatriots in the belief that we all
are equal children of Bharat Mata.’

2. ‘We, the people of India, whichever profession or vocation
we are in, shall work with honesty, dedication and
discipline in the spirit of a New Work Culture.’

3. ‘We, the people of India, shall always give priority to
our patriotic duties and responsibilities over narrow self-
interest, even as we zealously strive for the realization o
our rights enshrined in the Constitution.’

The BJP’s Appeal to Dear Countrymen

TO translate this manifesto into reality, we appeal to our all
compatriots to vote for the BJP and its allies to power in the elections
to the 12th Lok Sabha. A moment comes when the right choice can
change the course of a nation’s history. This is the moment to make
a decisive choice between the BJP and a decrepit, morally bankrupt
Congress; between the BJP and opportunist parties that have no
ideological conviction like the Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party;
and between the BJP and the Communist parties who have a hideous
history of betrayal of the national interest at every crucial juncture.
In the coming election:
¢ The choice is between stability and another mid-term
election soon.
¢ The choice is between an able Prime Minister and prime
ministerial pretenders.
¢ The choice is between a Government that will change the
life of every Indian for the better or one that will make a
bad condition still worse.
¢ The choice is between nationalism and a Foreign Hand.
The BJP gives a solemn assurance to the people of India: ‘We
shall sincerely strive to fulfill all the commitments set out in the
manifesto. If the BJP is voted to power, the India that enters the 21st
century and the next millennium, will be an India that will hold her
head high and whose citizens will be enjoying the long-awaited
fruits of progress made possible by a Government committed to
Su-raj (good governance). Guided by a 10-year perspective, our
Government will aim to achieve what others could not in the last
fifty years. Our victory will be people’s victory. It will be the victory
of Bharat Mata.’

Our Vision, Our Faith,
Our Commitment

It is out of the past that the future is moulded.
It is the past that becomes the future...
—Swami Vivekananda

Even as this century draws to a close and the millennium to ins, India
stands at a critical crossroad of history. Centuries’ old hopes and
aspirations of our people yearn for a true expression. The destiny
of our land and its people cries for fulfilment. At such crucial turns
historical choices are made and instruments of change adopted.
That destined vehicle of change is the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Never before in the long history of our land has the country
been governed by such a morally rudderless and financially corrupt
regime. Seldom have our trusting people been duped by a baser
band. With the people’s hopes belied and their aspirations thwarted,
our ancient land stands today face to face with the option of a
real change, a chance for a true departure from the last 50 years
of Congress misrule, an alternative and an option: The Bharatiya
Janata Party.

Our people are looking towards the BJP to become just this
instrument of change. The party is ready to shoulder this great
duty and responsibility. The task is nothing short of rekindling
the lamp of our eternal ‘Dharma’, that Sanatan thought which

our sages bequeathed to mankind — a social system based
on compassion, cooperation, justice, freedom, equality and
tolerance.

To reallse this goal, the BJP will launch a new social, economic

Untitled-10 247 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM

248 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

and political order. It will strive to transform the existing system of
governance, to make it responsive and answerable to the concerns
of our citizens. It will strive to make the economy cater to the
largest demands of the largest number. The party will endeavour
to place in the service of the nation a political organisation that is
conscientious and clean. Above all, the BJP will secure for India
a place in the comity of nations which befits its vast cultural,
intellectual, economic, scientific and human wealth.

We realise that correcting the mistakes of the last 50 years of
Congress misrule, of piecing together the shattered dreams of our
citizens, of restructuring our polity which has been delivered a body
blow by the present regime, of restoring 10 the state’s authority and
reviving faith in the Government, is by no means an easy task. But
we also realise that only the BJP has the ideological commitment,
moral conviction and political courage to shoulder this task and
gently guide our nation into the next millennium. The present
millennium began with the subjugation of our ancient land; let
a reinvigorated, proud, prosperous and strong India herald the
next millennium.

In this noble mission, we shall be guided by our Manifesto — it
contains our commitments to the nation and its citizens. Our state
governments in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi have demonstrated
that for the BJP, these commitments constitute a sacred covenant
with the people. We do what we say. This Manifesto shall be the
covenant of our government.

With a BJP Government at the Centre, the next five years
will be devoted to implementing our Manifesto based on the
four concepts of Suraksha, Shuchita, Swadeshi and Samrasata.
Hindutva, or cultural nationalism, shall be the rainbow which
will bridge our present to our glorious past and pave the way
for an equally glorious future; it will guide the transition from
Swarajya to Surajya. Our Manifesto reflects the application
of these four concepts in good governance and their role in
moulding the nation we dreamt of on the dawn of Independence
— a prosperous and strong India, a country where every citizen
regards this land of ours, this Bharatbhoomi, that stretches from

Untitled-10 248 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM

Election Manifestoes * 249

the Indus to the seas, as his sacred motherland.

The BJP believes in one nation, one people, and one culture.
We are, therefore, committed to promoting social reconciliation
rather than conflict. We are resolved to put an end to the politics of
competitive communalism, of appeasement, and of casteism. The
politics of pitting caste against caste, community against community
and class against class has torn asunder our social fabric. The BJP
will reweave this fabric into a harmonious pattern.

Our Nation, Our State,
Our Government

A New Direction, A New Dispensation.

Nearly half a century of Congress misrule has all but shattered the
internal polity of the country. There is not one institution of the
Republic left that can be said to now be in a state of total health.
The Legislature, the Executive, unfortunately the Judiciary, and
even the media have been afflicted by the mindlessness of the
Congress’ exploitation and loot of our country.

The Bharatiya Janata Party well recognises that to correct
this great wrong of the past five decades requires the skill and
commitment of a Vishwakarma. With humility, we address ourselves
to this task.

The first is to restore to our state its authority. Perhaps never
since the scourge of the Pindaries has the writ of our state been as
enfeebled as by this Congress misrule. The primary task, therefore,
is to restore to the state, and to governance, its honour and its
prestige — izzat and iqbal. For this the BJP will institute a set of
measures. This is a challenge that is principally moral and only
then functional. The BJP commits itself, therefore, to:

1. Addressing purposefully to the many challenges being

posed to us in Jammu & Kashmir and in the North-East of
India. We are of the view that in both these strategically
important border regions of the country, misgovernance,
neglect and emotional separation from India lie at the root
of the problems. Terrorism and challenges to the state will
be met forthrightly; changes in law where warranted will
be brought about expeditiously; the approach will be firm
but always fair.

Untitled-10 250 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM

Election Manifestoes * 251

To translate this Manifesto into reality, to fulfil our destined
role of leading India into the next millennium, the Bharatiya
Janata Party seeks the support and cooperation of all our
citizens.

2. Launching a major nationwide drive to identify influx
of illicit arms and their possession. Proliferation of small
arms affects directly the law and order in the country as
also the security of the nation. We recognise that narcotics
smuggling and narco-terrorism are linked. The country
must be rid of both. The law in this regard will be made
more effective and implemented.

3. Toning up the administration (as enumerated subsequently)
and reforming its functioning, accountability and
responsibilities.

4. Rationalising the number, structure, composition and role
of paramilitary forces, including recent initiatives like
National Security Guard (NSG), Rapid Action Force (RAF)
and Special Protection Group (SPG). We will review the
personal security arrangments: We believe that the security
of the high dignitaries of the country is the responsibility
of the state. This security, however, should neither be
exaggerated nor intrusive. It should not ever be at the cost
of the collective convenience of the citizens of the country.
The BJP will reform this.

An Agenda for Change
Constitutional Reforms
The BJP believes that Centre-State relations, which have been
ona downslide for the past 50 years, need to be improved. We also
believe that reforms are needed for a stronger Union and equal
rights for all citizens.
1. The BJP will implement the main recommendations of the
Sarkaria Commission, such as:
(a) Restoring the balance of resources in favour of the
States;
(b) Ending the misuse of Art 356 to dismiss state
governments and dissolve state assemblies. We will
explore the possibility of making it mandatory for the

Untitled-10 251 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM

252 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

Union Government to seek Parliament’s approval by
two-thirds majority for dismissal of state governments
and,

(c) Consulting state governments before appointing
Governors.

2. We promise to carve out Uttaranchal, Vananchal, Vidarbha
and Chhattisgarh and give them full statehood. We will
further consider setting up a commission to examine
the formation of smaller states. Delhi will be given full
statehood.

3. The BJP will provide Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh in J&K
state with regional development councils.

4. We will abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, which puts
Jammu & Kashmir on a separate and separatist pedestal,
for the state’s full and final integration with the Union.

5. We will set up an inter-state council under Article 263 of
the Constitution to settle all inter-state and Centre-State
disputes to avoid ad hoc responses to issues like that of
Cauvery waters.

6. The BJP is committed to Article 44 of the Constitution. We
will adopt a Uniform Civil Code which will be applicable to
every community and foster a common Bharatiya identity,
apart from ensuring gender equality. Regressive personal
laws will cease to have legal validity.

7. The manner of appointment of constitutional functionaries
will be reviewed.

8. We will maintain a national register of citizens and
introduce a multipurpose identity card.

Electoral Reforms

The BJP carries a conviction that amongst the many causes
that have brought the state of our polity to its present plight, a
major factor is faulty elections. We will, therefore, immediately
on assuming office, implement various electoral reforms. For free,
fair and fearless elections, the BJP will:

1. Update and adopt the Goswami Committee report;

2. Grant statutory status to the Code of Conduct drawn up

Untitled-10 252 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM

Election Manifestoes * 253

by the Election Commission and give it teeth;

3. Introduce a scheme of state-funding of candidates to all
legislatures;

4. Provide suitable incentives for open, official corporate
funding to all recognised political parties;

5. Undertake fresh delimitation of Lok Sabha and Assembly
constituencies on the basis of the 1991 census;

6. Make it mandatory for political parties to submit audited
accounts for public scrutiny annually;

7. Examine the feasibility of introducing the list system;

8. Expedite the process of issuing identity cards to all voters
and make it a mandatory requirement for voting;

9. Scrutinise all voters’ lists to ensure that no legitimate voter
is excluded;

10. Take steps to curb expenditure on elections by imposing
a ban on advertisements, cutouts, etc;

11. Introduce electronic voting machines to hasten the process
of counting;

12. Examine the possibility of simultaneous elections to the
Parliament, State Assemblies and Panchayats;

13. Ensure speedy and exemplary punishment for those who
indulge in booth-capturing;

14. Officials found guilty of involvement in poll rigging will
be given exemplary punishment;

15. Amend the anti-defection law whereby a member of
any Legislature who changes parties will lose his or her
membership of the House; and,

16. Prevent the misuse of Doordarshan and A.LR. by the ruling

party.

Corruption & Its Cure

The BJP treats this affliction as the single greatest wrong that
the Congress misrule of the past 50 years has brought about on
our land. The corruption that now corrodes our country is of the
spirit, it is moral, and it is also financial. The challenge thus to
governance is principally of setting an example — of impeccable
probity and unimpeachable accountability of all public men and
women. This must not cover simply the elected representatives

Untitled-10 253 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM

254 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

of the people but also the executive, the police and, indeed, even
the judiciary, where the touch of corruption can easily be felt.
The BJP will address itself to this challenge and task, by adopting
measures that are mentioned here. We do not claim that this is
either the ultimate blueprint for the reduction of corruption or the
last word on it. It is an expression of our commitment; a first step
to setting right a very great wrong of many years’ malignancy; a
beginning and that, too, with ourselves. For a clean public life in
which morality and ethics find due recognition, the BJP will:

1. Make it obligatory on every elected representative to
make, public his entire income and wealth within 90 days
of election;

2. Introduce extensive regulations and requirements upon
those who hold public office so that no conflict of interest
is ever permitted to influence a proper discharge of their
duties;

3. Appoint a Lok Pal to entertain complaints of corruption
against anybody holding public office, including the Prime
Minister;

4. Take measures to modify and reform the methodology
of government approval for contracts, schemes and
large money value agreements so as to make them more
transparent. The powers of patronage, the right to say
‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to simple daily requirements of the citizens
will be reduced drastically. A government that intrudes
the least, we hold, governs the best. We will endeavour
to combine this with open and transparent governance;

5. Expeditiously deal with cases of corruption unresolved
and in which no action has been taken in the past 10 years;

6. Take steps to ensure that investigative and intelligence
agencies like RAW, IB and CBI are not used to subserve
the political designs of the ruling party.

Judicial Reforms
For speedy, fair and inexpensive justice, the BJP will:
1. Appoint special judges to clear the huge arrears at all
levels of the judiciary;
2. Fill the vacancies in the High Courts and the Supreme

Untitled-10 254 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM

Election Manifestoes * 255

Court without any further delay;

3. Legislate to the effect that courts do not give unending
adjournments and complete cases within one year.

4. Constantly review the salaries and pension benefits of all
judges so as to attract the best legal talent to the judiciary;

5. Expand and strengthen the existing legal aid facilities for
economically weaker sections of the society; and,

6. Set up a National Judicial Commission which will be
responsible for making judicial appointments in the High
Courts and the Supreme Court.

Panchayati Raj
For better local self-governance at the village-level, the BJP will:
1. In the light of recent experience, make changes in the
Constitution 73rd and 74th amendments to further
strengthen the Panchayati Raj system; and,
2. Endeavour to make the panchayats financially self-sufficient.

Administrative Reforms

For a caring, just and accountable administration, to provide
high quality services the citizens value and for a new paradigm in
public administration, the BJP will:

1. Make the district administration accountable for any
outbreak of violence; institute a time-bound inquiry;
publish the findings; punish the guilty; and, compensate
the victims;

2. Update and implement the National Police Commission
report in a time-bound manner;

3. Ask each Ministry /Department to set clear performance
standards, including cost consciousness, in quantifiable
terms and monitor the adherence to these standards;

4. Introduce a scheme of fixed minimum tenure for some
identified posts at higher ranks, e.g. Chief Secretaries,
Secretaries to Government, DGPs, etc;

5. Disfavour extensions to bureaucrats and police officers;

6. Institute an annual Sardar Patel award for the best three
district officers, as a beginning;

7. Ensure uniform housing and other related facilities for

Untitled-10 255 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM

256 * Party Document Vol-1

officers in the same grade and in the same station. The
system of allotment of houses will be made transparent;
8. Introduce a system of allowing lateral entry of personnel
from the private sector, NGOs, educational/research
institutes into government;
9. Identify areas from which government must withdraw so
that departments can be wound up ina phased manner;

10. Strengthen the department of administrative reforms at
the Centre and in the States; and,

11. Give the citizens what is their due. A huge divide today
separates the citizen, the society and the state. This is
principally on account of the state not treating the rights
of the citizens as sacrosanct; not fulfilling its obligations
towards the citizens sincerely; and, not providing to the
citizens the services that are its bounden duty. The BJP
will, therefore, identify such areas as warrant immediate
correction, as they affect the daily life of the ordinary
citizen, and implement reforms in them within a given
timeframe.

Shri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya

The BJP is committed to the concept of one nation, one people,
one culture — our nationalist vision is not merely bound by the
geographical or political identity of India, but defined by our
ancient cultural heritage. From this belief flows our faith in ‘Cultural
Nationalism’ which is the core of Hindutva. That, we believe, is
the identity of our ancient nation — Bharatvarsha.

Hindutva is a unifying principle which alone can preserve
the unity and integrity of our nation. It is a collective endeavour
to protect and re-energise the soul of India, to take us into the next
millennium as a strong and prosperous nation. Hindutva is also
the antidote to the shameful efforts of any section to benefit at the
expense of others.

We hold that only by recognising the limitless strength of
cultural nationalism, can the nation be moulded. When the BJP
joined the movement for the construction of the Shri Ram Mandir
at Ayodhya, it was to strengthen just these foundations.

On coming to power, the BJP Government will facilitate the

Untitled-10 256 11/7/2016 11:19:36 PM

Election Manifestoes * 257

construction of a magnificent Shri Ram Mandir at Janmasthan in
Ayodhya which will be a tribute to Bharat Mata. This dream moves
millions of people in our land; the concept of Rama lies at the core
of their consciousness.

Our Economy, Action And Direction

Economic Growth and Employment Through Swadeshi

Four decades of Congress misrule have ruined the economic
creativity of our country; these decades failed to place the country
ona sound economic footing, befitting India’s stature as the largest
democracy in the world. The experiments of the Congress, with
vastly divergent models, have brought the country, from time to
time, to the brink of crisis. The passive victim of all these experiments
has been the long suffering citizen of our country; even as under-
nourishment, malnutrition, illiteracy and deprivation afflict a
large percentage of them; even as the quality of life gets fractured
between India and Bharat.

We commit ourselves to bringing certainty in economic policy.
The Bharatiya Janata Party is proud of India’s heritage and has
an abiding faith in the creative genius of every Indian. We are
committed to an economy that enables India to achieve its destiny
in the forefront of the nations of the world.

In 1991, the present government claimed that it inherited an
economy which had a slender foreign exchange reserves. Accepting
IMF conditionalities, it initiated a programme of deregulation of
industry, trade and exchange rate policies, a radically different
approach to foreign investment. The consequential foreign
exchange reserves that it will be leaving, as a legacy to the successor
government, are, however, fragile, being composed mainly of
quick-sand components of foreign institutional investments and
FCNR deposits. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is only a minor
component of them. An enormous $7 billion becomes ripe for debt
servicing in 1996-97 itself. In its zeal to contain fiscal deficits task in
which it failed, the fiscal deficit continuing around 7% of GDP —it

Untitled-10 258 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

Election Manifestoes * 259

pruned developmental expenditure beyond acceptable limits, in
consequence constraining growth.

Despite the proclaimed deregulation, over the past five years,
all earlier structures and institutions of the License Quota-Permit
Raj remain intact. Social infrastructure has been neglected and the
lot of the poor and deprived has further deteriorated. The country’s
defence requirements were also neglected, thereby putting the
nation’s security in jeopardy.

The neglect of infrastructure by this government has left a
legacy of a fractured physical infrastructure —roads, railways,
post, power, telecom—are grinding to near immobility, in the
process constraining growth elsewhere in the economy. In
its methodology for containing the budget through limits on
monetisation of the deficit, this government has compulsorily
resorted to heavy borrowings, which in turn, has resulted in
liquidity to the rest of the economy and a heating up of the
interest rates. Our domestic industry, starved of liquidity, is in
danger of slipping into recession.

In totality, this government will leave an economy more fragile
and shattered than what it inherited in 1991. The challenges thus,
to us in our bid at governance, are formidable.

Our Economic Thought

In outlining our strategy, we recognise that the post Cold War
world has adopted the market place for fast economic growth.
However, our thought is defined by the following:

(i) Market may ensure growth, but it cannot ensure redistribute
equity and justice. The state continues to have a role to
play;

(ii) The poor and deprived have, therefore, to be helped by the
state to cross the poverty line and to attain a sustainable
minimum quality of life;

(iii) On the economic front, the old order, based on comparative
advantage of labour or resources, is giving way to a new
order built on the basis of human resources, skills and
technology. A proper policy can make it India’s strength;
and

(iv) A society such as ours has to innovate its own strategy,

Untitled-10 259 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

260 * Party Document Vol-1

to adapt to the high-tech challenges of a supposedly
borderless world, without the attendant social stresses,
economic instability and the abandonment either of its
identity or of its own socio-cultural ethos. This is the essence
of our Swadeshi approach: A self-reliant India, asserting
its national economic interests, not as autarchy, but as a
pre-requisite to meeting the challenge of globalisation;
of preserving our identity without compromising
our sovereignty or self respect. We reject unbridled
consumerism and believe in adherence to sustainable
consumption and growth.

Foreign investment will be required and encouraged for world
class technology. But when foreign savings have to supplement and
assist the economy in circumstances where domestic savings are
inadequate, we compromise with the nation’s long term interests.
While many countries which started late but arrived much earlier
than India, managed their growth on savings levels around 35-40%
of GDP, the Indian domestic savings rate has steadily declined to
a low level of 20% of GDP during Congress rule. This is grossly
inadequate for even the current level of investment, let alone the
levels required for a faster growth of the economy. Not only have
private savings declined, more worrisomely, governmental savings
are now virtually nil.

We recognise two immediate priorities — first, providing the
physical and economic infrastructure that is appropriate for the
stipulated growth in our GDP; second, providing the required social
infrastructure for a minimum sustainable quality of life.

To attain these and yet contain fiscal deficit requires a different
approach. The BJP will work towards pruning non-developmental
expenditure; minimise the commercial activities of government;
severely cutting back on bureaucracy; shedding the structures of
controls and regulation; and re-equipping itself for its new role
of providing a framework for free market operations for growth,
accentuating programmes for poverty eradication and social
Infrastructure.

Untitled-10 260 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

Election Manifestoes * 261

Fiscal Reform and Taxation

We believe that taxation alone cannot be the base for revenue.
A stable and fast growth is possible only through a high order of
investment matched by an appropriate level of domestic savings.
The present government has done a great disservice by encouraging
avoidable consumerism and diverting the depleted savings into
speculative rather than safe and productive channels.

¢ We will structure our fiscal reforms so that savings and
contracted savings are augmented to levels that will take
care of a higher order of investment needed for faster
growth;

¢ In taxation, we will ensure that not only levels and rates
of taxation are such that growth is not constrained, but
that the burden-sharing of taxes is equitably distributed
among all affluent sections of society. We will mitigate
the undue rigours of indirect taxes — today indirect taxes
constitute 71 % of tax revenue —so that productivity and
growth are not hampered.

We will devise a suitably structured valued added tax (VAT)
so as to ensure better burden-sharing among ‘goods and services’
that contribute to value addition.

¢ In tariffs we will ensure that the domestic sector gets a
level playing field, and does not become uncompetitive;

¢ We will also strive to lighten the debt burden on the nation.
This in turn will contribute to interest rate stabilisation;

¢ We will not hike Excise Duties on items of mass
consumption;

¢ We will examine the aspect of sales tax reform and
equalisation;

¢ We will ensure operational autonomy of the RBI;

¢ We will adopt firm measures to prevent the generation of
black money;

¢ We will rationalise and simplify the present tax structure
and raise the Income Tax exemption limit to Rs. 60,000;

¢ We will provide weighted deductions taking number of
dependents on earning member;

¢ We will exempt all investments in approved organisations,
private OR public, from the levy of Wealth Tax;

¢ Wewill give tax reliefs to employment-oriented industries
in non-municipal areas;

¢ We will ensure minimum contribution to government
exchequer by all profit-earning business units. The concept
of ‘zero business units’ will be done away with;

¢ We will give special tax concessions to writers, artists,
academics and others engaged in intellectual and cultural
pursuits.

Price Stability and Consumer Protection
It is our firm belief that the price level can be controlled
only through maximisation of production and a minimisation of
costs of production. This is to be achieved through technology
upgradation, economics of scale and free competition. Towards
this end, the BJP will:
¢ Ensure an efficient, low-cost, corruption-free PDS, so that
there is a regular, assured, timely and adequate supply of
commodities to the consumers in the rural, tribal, remote
and backward areas of our country;
¢ Supply better quality foodgrains through the PDS by
enhancing the norms for quality standards rather than
easing them as has been done by the Congress;
¢ Make pulses, cooking oil and soap also available through
PDS, in addition to food-grains, sugar and kerosene;
¢ Improve the Consumer Protection Act of 1986, and ensure
its application; and,
¢ Encourage consumer movements.

Black Money and Corruption
Starting from its Jana Sangh days, the BJP has been waging
a relentless battle against the twin evils of corruption and black
money. We are committed to rooting out corruption, thus also the
malignancy of black money.
¢ We will encourage capital creation through funds from
such a parallel economy, retaining the right of government
to tax the revenue flows from such created capital.
¢ The BJP will open up sectors such as social forestry,
wasteland development and housing for rural and urban
poor.

Untitled-10 262 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

Election Manifestoes * 263

¢ We will also review the rationale of the Urban Land Ceiling
Act, in this context.
Infrastructure
We hold that power, telecommunications, transport (surface,
sea and air) constitute the basic building blocks of our development.
With hardly 50% of the roads surfaced, about 40% of the traffic
volume is handled by the National Highway System (NHS) which
constitutes hardly 2% of the road network.
Our Railway network has grown only by 16% over five decades.
The ports have become the greatest constraint on our world trade.
The dimensions of the power and telecommunications situation
cripple development.
¢ Weneed to actively develop a National Waterways network;
¢ To meet our minimum needs, a staggering 10,000 MW
have to be added annually for the next 15 years. Irrigation
needs press upon our resources. All these call for large
investments.
¢ We propose, therefore, to lay the foundations of a strong
bond market in the country which can take care of the
massive financial requirements. We invite foreign capital
in the field of infrastructure.
¢ We will initate a framework which will facilitate quick
redressal of the acute infrastructure crisis based on
international co-operation and partnership.
¢ We will strive to confine the role of the state to that of a
facilitator, withdrawing in favour of suitably structured
independent regulatory authorities.

Public Sector
At present the policy relating to public sector is in disarray.
¢ The BJP believes in confining the public sector only to
sensitive areas where the nation’s security is involved and
to areas where the presence of public sector is necessary
for providing a moderating or counter-poising role to the
ill effects, if any, of an unchecked private sector.
¢ Public sector presence will continue in areas furthering
social objectives.
¢ The remaining public sector that would continue will be

Untitled-10 263 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

264 * Party Document Vol-1

managed with the least interference by government.

In the case of disinvestment from ailing, non-profitable or sick
public sector undertakings, the BJP will constitute a Disinvestment
Commission for taking care of disinvestment from the country’s
public sector.

¢ While disinvesting, care will be taken so that the workers’
interests are not harmed.

¢ The National Renewal Fund will be realigned to take
care of the constant requirements of retraining and
redeployment of workers that may be necessary in a fast
growing economy.

* Sales proceeds from PSU disinvestment will be utilised
only on capital expenditure.

Foreign Trade and Capital

Foreign Trade Policy has in the past degenerated into one of
providing palliatives. It has now become necessary to strengthen
the interface between industry and trade.

¢ We will select core industries and a system of destinations
and initiate an integrated production for export planning
with selective intervention so that this sector, so vital to
the economy, acquires dynamism.

¢ We will also strive to forge such alliances with or
memberships of regional trading blocs that will give further
impetus to our exports.

The BJP welcomes foreign investment, because we hold that
it supplies knowledge, technology and know-how and sharpens
the quality and competitive edge of our economy.

¢ We will, however, strive to minimise our dependence on
foreign savings.

¢ We will prioritise foreign investment in sectors that will
promote exports in preference to sectors that will cater
solely or exclusively to the domestic market.

¢ Keeping in view that dissemination of world class
technology is an objective of foreign investment, we will
give preference to overseas investors who have domestic
partners.

¢ We will encourage foreign investment in infrastructure,

Untitled-10 264 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

Election Manifestoes * 265

areas of high technology and R & D within India.
¢ As for MNCs in consumer non-durables, we do not consider
them as areas of priority.

Industrial Policy

Industry in India has to be enabled to become more productive,
more innovative. Only then will it fulfil its main goal: Enhance the
national wealth, provide greater employment in ever increasing
numbers and thus assist the growth of other sectors, including
agriculture. For, we ecognise this inseperable interdependence.
Our exports must compete with the best in the world, add to our
resources and fiscal health, and thus enable India to achieve the
status that we believe is its destiny. The BJP assures all about
creating a healthy investment and industrial environment.

The BJP believes in the continued role and relevance of the
small-scale sector. This important segment of our national economy,
which has been entirely ignored by the Congress and whose
very existence is threatened by the present policy of economic
liberalisation, will receive all encouragement and help from a BJP
Government.

The following principles will guide the industrial policy of
the BJP:

A. Economic Sovereignty

The party regards the preservation of the nation’s economic
interests as a component of our external economic relations.
Globalisation, to us, is not a synonym for the obliteration of national
economic interests. Indeed, in the ensuing global competition we
need to be constantly mindful of preserving them.

B. Modernisation

BJP stands for a mode 24 and progressive India, open to new
ideas, new technology and fresh capital. A modern India to the BJP
is not a westernised India; a pale copy of the western economic
models.

C. Decentralisation

Untitled-10 265 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

266 * Party Document Vol-1

We stand for a decentralised economic order. The BJP stands for
political as well as economic democracy. The role of the government
must change from the restrictive to the supportive and encouraging.

The BJP will, therefore:

¢ Debureaucratise industrial approvals and cut down the
plethora of restrictive controls. Industrial Development and
Regulations Act will be replaced by Industrial Development
Act;

¢ Encourage research and development as part of the process
of industrial growth and over-all modernisation;

¢ Hazardous industries will be permitted only in specified
areas. Separate industrial satellites will be set up exclusively
for such units;

¢ Small-scale sector will be given all importance and
encouragement. We will establish agencies to help the
small-scale sector in purchasing, marketing and selling
their products; and,

¢ Ensure a healthy capital market.

Our Concept Of Employment
And Labour’s Role

Creating Jobs and Opportunities

Apart from employment which will be created in the normal
course by the growth of the economy, special employment schemes
will be undertaken by the Bharatiya Janata Party to eradicate
unemployment.

The BJP proposes to introduce a scheme of voluntary National
Service to undertake the task of national reconstruction and also
in order to instill a sense of discipline and nationalism among the
youth of the country. This service will aim at reclaiming wasteland
for commercial use — for instance, after reclaiming the waste land,
it will be used for horticulture, social forestry or any other purpose
that will provide the youth involved in the reclamation with
continued income. Similarly, the National Service will be used for
river management schemes.

Apart from this, the BJP proposes to:

1. Increase employment opportunities in all sectors of the
organised economy;
2. Introduce policies and programmes to:
(i) Develop agriculture, particularly in regions which
are at present less developed and backward.

(ii) Promote industrial growth with special attention
to village, cottage and small-scale sectors. Special
emphasis will be laid on agro-industry.

(iii) Undertake large-scale housing activity that will
generate both jobs and additional shelter in both
rural and urban areas.

Untitled-10 267 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

268 * Party Document Vol-1

(iv) Provide transport facilities with special emphasis in
improving availability of transport in rural areas.

(v) Augment employment opportunities in villages
through Schemes like Antyodaya, Gokul Gram, Gopal
Gram, Saraswati Yojana as already being implemented
by BJP governments in Rajasthan and Gujarat.

(vi) Provide and improve infrastructure, especially in
rural areas, such as roads, small dams and water
conservation projects.

(vii) Promote vocational training.

Labour

BJP believes in healthy trade unionism. It will:

1. Rationalise and simplify Labour Laws;

2. Recognise unions on the basis of secret ballot and have
provisions for comprehensive bargaining;

3. Introduce worker participation from the shop floor to the
board room in all public sector projects, public limited
companies and foreign companies operating in India;

4. Protect workers against inflation;

5. Evolve an effective mechanism and ensure better
implementation of laws to protect labour from occupational
health hazards arising from industries like asbestos, cement,
slate, mica, chemicals, textiles, etc. The workers will have
the right to be informed about the possible health hazards
they could be exposed to on the shop floor; and,

6. Not allow an exit policy without fulfilling corresponding
obligations towards labour.

Government Employees

BJP will set up a permanent Employees Welfare Board witha
view to resolving the long-standing problems related to:

1. Time scale promotion;

2. Revision of pay scales and award of bonus;

3. Implementation of awards;

4. Housing; and,

5. Social welfare measures and travel concession for retired

personnel. Oo

Our Scientific Talent, Our Technology

Harnessing Nature For Human Welfare

The BJP believes that science and technology must play its due
role in transforming India into a prosperous and strong country.
The BJP will apply appropriate scientific and technological
methods for increasing productivity, eradicating poverty,
hunger and disease and providing meaningful employment
along with the basic amenities of life. We believe that science
and technology need to be harnessed to improve the lot of the
vast section of our population living below the poverty line. We
hold that science is not merely harnessing nature for material
wealth but is as well for liberating and enriching the mind
and enlarging the human spirit. The BJP will use science in the
service of the poor and develop technology that has a humane
face. Towards this end, we will:

1. Foster a scientific temper among the people;

2. Use science and technology for increasing productivity
and generating employment;

3. Implement a vigorous programme of science education
and research for improving quality of life;

4. Establish a network of centres for application of science
and technology to rural areas, implement ‘lab-to-land’
programmes and develop a strong low-cost agro-Industrial
base;

5. Put new life into National Laboratories to develop them
as centres of excellence in applied research;

6. Direct these laboratories to evolve appropriate technology
for Indian needs;

7. Accelerate the production of scientific literature in regional

Untitled-10 269 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

270 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

languages and evolve a national terminology for science
and technology;

8. Create the right working conditions for our best brains to
remain in India and serve the country and not migrate to
other lands;

9. Make a systematised effort to bring national laboratories
and industry together by setting up ‘Technology Parks’ to
be patronised by industry. This will promote cooperation
between industry’s resources and talent in laboratory;

10. Safeguard national interests and our intellectual property
rights by encouraging research and development;

11. Undertake research in the field of drugs, micro-biology,
bio-technology, bio-fertilisers etc.; and,

12. Strengthen research in indigenous systems of medicine.

Our Foreign Policy

India, the New Millennium, the World

In a post-Cold War world India will be confronted by many new
challenges and opportunities. To meet them, to benefit from the
opportunities, mindful of the existing global disequilibrium and
in consonance with India’s national interests, our foreign policy in
the emerging decades will be based on the human values of peace,
equality and cooperation.

The BJP holds that as a departure from the recent past, Indian
diplomacy should be conducted in tune with India’s position as
a strong power and a major player in the world arena. A billion
people who do not depend upon anyone for feeding or clothing
themselves are a power which cannot be ignored. Our nation needs
to regain its lost pride and the BJP alone can undertake this task.
While we believe in partnership with everyone, we reject the very
thought of patronage by anybody. The BJP’s foreign policy will be
guided by the following agenda:

1. Sovereign equality amongst nations; a rejection of political

or economic hegemonism.

2. Promotion of Asian solidarity; development of South
Asian Regional Cooperation; and, emphasis on improved
relations with neighbouring countries. The BJP does not
accept outside interference in this region as being beneficial
for it.

3. Pakistan continues to follow a policy of fomenting
insurgency seeking to create instability and unrest in India.
The BJP stands committed to thwarting all these attempts.
In this context, we state:

(a) The BJP affirms unequivocally India’s sovereignty over

Untitled-10 271 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

272 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

the whole of Jammu & Kashmir, including Pakistan
occupied Kashmir; and,

(b) The BJP declares that it will not accept any interference
in our country’s internal affairs.

4. Our relations with the USA will be based on mutual respect
and a congruence of interests. We note, however, that
US policy for this region continues to suffer from lack of
vision and that it disregards India’s political and security
interests.

5. India and Russia have a long tradition of good relations
and have much to gain from the compatibility of their
geopolitical interests in Asia. The BJP will endeavour to
further explore the avenues of bilateral cooperation in this
direction.

6. Our relations with the People’s Republic of China offer an
opportunity to now put them on a footing of friendship
and cooperation. For this we need to resolve the border
question in a fair and equitable manner. It cannot, however,
be ignored that the People’s Republic of China continues
to support Pakistan militarily and otherwise.

7. The BJP greatly regrets the continuing bloodshed in Sri
Lanka, particularly as India all through its history has had
warm fraternal ties with all sections of the population in
that country. The BJP is confident that within a united Sri
Lanka it should be possible to fulfil the aspirations of the
Tamil people.

8. The BJP pledges to maintain warm and friendly relations
with Nepal, with which India has the closest cultural,
religious and historical ties. The BJP will work actively
for resolving all outstanding issues. We welcome the
restoration of democracy in Nepal.

9. The BJP views with great sympathy the struggle for
restoration of democracy in Myanmar. It extends its
support to the task of reconciliation and reconstruction
in that country with which India has a long border and
age-old religious, cultural and historical ties.

10. The BJP will try to consolidate further the close and friendly
ties between India and Bhutan.

Untitled-10. 272 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

Election Manifestoes * 273

11. Inour relations with Bangladesh, illegal immigration into
India from that country has proved a major irritant. This
issue has cast its shadow on our bilateral ties and needs
to be resolved early.

12. Millions of sons and daughters of Mother India, settled
abroad as Overseas Indians, are considered by the BJP as
an asset to the country. Their emotional attachment to the
motherland is still deep. This must find due expression.
Schemes will be drawn up to attract substantial investments
by non-resident Indians. They will be welcome to set up
industrial units and industrial parks, and invest in the
infrastructure. The BJP will examine afresh the issue of
dual citizenship.

13. The BJP will launch a vigorous campaign for a permanent
membership for India in the UN Security Council.

The BJP stands committed to peace amongst all nations;
prosperity for all the peoples of the world; and, an international
role for India that befits this great and ancient nation.

Our Nation’s Security

Protecting Our Country

The BJP accords the highest importance to the security of our Nation,
our Society and our Citizens. We charge the present government
with imperilling our security, internal and external, as never before.

Our defence expenditure has been cut steadily in real terms
during the Narasimha Rao regime. This has seriously compromised
our combat effectiveness. The present Congress government has
been functioning without a full-time Defence Minister for over
three years, and this negligence of India’s sword arm has begun
to affect the morale of our gallant forces.

The BJP will correct this damaging imbalance. We will accord
due importance to all security related issues — the emerging
global realities and regional complexities demand this as the very
minimum response from our government.

Internal Security
The nature of the state and its relationship with society has
a direct bearing on the level of the citizens’ national commitment.
An insensitive and uncaring state erodes the citizens’ allegiance to
the nation. The BJP will restore national commitment to its rightful
place by establishing a harmonious relationship between state and
society. We will:
1. Defuse tension in long-festering trouble spots;
2. Ensure protection of life and property from insurgents
and foreign mercenaries;
3. Provide our security apparatus with a free hand to deal
with terrorism;
4. Revitalise and reinforce law and order machinery;

Untitled-10 274 11/7/2016 11:19:37 PM

Election Manifestoes * 275

5. Institute police reforms and upgrade the capability of the
force; and,

6. Legislate tough deterrent laws against terrorist and
disruptive activities (TADA was repealed to pander to
vote bank politics) while safeguarding democratic rights.

Jammu & Kashmir

The absence of political far-sightedness and clarity of national
objectives has resulted in our nation continuing to have to pay
a price even 50 years after Jammu & Kashmir became a part of
the Republic. The failure of successive Congress Governments to
formulate a Jammu & Kashmir policy that takes into account the
State’s internal problems has led to a situation where this strategic
border state has emerged as the principal challenge to Indian
nationhood. The BJP realises the magnitude of the challenge and
dedicates itself to the task of not only solving the internal problems
of the state but also reclaiming the portion of our territory which
has been illegally held by Pakistan for nearly five decades. Without
repeating the mistakes of yesteryears and merely reacting to
Pakistan’s moves, we will:

1. Immediately strengthen the civil administration by
inducting able and honest administrators;

2. Provide a free hand to our security forces to deal with
the menace of terrorism and induction of men and arms
from Pakistan, while ensuring that democratic rights are
not violated;

3. Cleanse the local police and administration of malcontents
who have aligned themselves with the terrorists or are
pro-Pakistan;

4. Declare Doda a disturbed area and invoke the Armed
Forces (Special Powers) Act to prevent this district from
becoming a haven for mercenaries and terrorists;

5. Launch a massive welfare programme for all regions of
the state and ensure that there is no seepage;

6. Hold free and fair elections in the state after terrorism has
been brought under control and every person, including
the Pandits who have been forced out of the Valley, is
provided with an opportunity to participate in the polls;

Untitled-10 275 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM

276 * Party Document Vol-1

7. Rehabilitate all persons displaced from terrorism-afflicted
areas of Jammu & Kashmir; and,
8. Set up regional councils for Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh.

North-East
The north-eastern states of our country continue to suffer
from the violence perpetrated by insurgency and ethnic strife. Poor
governance, a callous administration, seepage of development
funds, and Congress’ politics of manipulation have contributed
to the alienation of the people and the growth of insurgency.
In Assam, ULFA and Bodo militants have begun to strike with
regularity; in Nagaland and Manipur the NSCN continues with
its depredation; and, in Tripura, militant tribal outfits have once
again reared their ugly heads. The tide of illegal immigration from
Bangladesh has only worsened the situation. The BJP will address
itself to the problems of our north-eastern States and institute a
grievance redressal system monitored from Delhi. It will also take
the following steps to restore the rule of law in the troubled States:
1. Check the inflow of foreign arms and terrorists from
training camps across the border;
2. Strengthen the security apparatus and intelligence network;
3. Provide all citizens with identity cards on a priority basis;
4. Check the narcotics trade and attendant ills in the region;
and,
5. Plan and execute an integrated and accelerated economic
development programme.

Himalayas

Over the past five decades, our Himalayan bastions have
been strategically pierced. Despite that, the attitude of successive
Congress governments has remained unchanged. Strategically,
the government has failed to restore a balance there, leave alone
regain the initiative. In the process, we have also lost large national
territories to the People’s Republic of China, thus demonstrating
an absence of strategic thought about our Himalayan bastions. The
BJP will evolve a security policy for the Himalayas so that India’s
national interests are fully safeguarded.

Untitled-10 276 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM

Election Manifestoes * 277

External Security

We believe that pro-active diplomacy, especially defence
diplomacy, coupled with adequate preparedness of our armed
forces, is the key to securing our frontiers against aggression. This
requires both strategy and tactics. The BJP will:

1. Set up a National Security Council;

2. Re-evaluate the country’s nuclear policy and exercise the
option to induct nuclear weapons;

3. Though the BJP stands committed to a nuclear-free world,
we cannot accept a world of nuclear apartheid.

(i) The BJP will thus not agree to the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) unless there is a simultaneous
agreement for a time-bound global elimination of
nuclear weapons in their entirety.

(ii) The BJP will not agree to the Fissile Material Control
Regime(FMCR).

(iii) The BJP will not agree to the Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR).

4. Expedite the serial production of Prithvi and make Agni
I operational for the deployment of these missiles. In
addition, hasten the development of Agni IJ;

5. Immediately upgrade conventional weapons and weapons
systems of the armed forces;

6. Strengthen the intelligence-gathering system, inclusive of
all intelligence agencies, initiate a Centre-State initiative on
intelligence gathering and sharing, step up air surveillance
of our territory, and acquire state-of-the-art electronic
equipment;

7. Strengthen the Air Force fleet with new generation aircraft;

8. Make a qualitative and quantitative improvement in our
naval capabilities;

9. Invest in R&D in areas of defence and missile technology
so that we become increasingly self-reliant;

10. Peg defence-related expenditure to real requirements; and,

11. Re-examine the role, structure and composition of the
numerous para-military forces and reorganise and reform
them.

Jai Jawan

The BJP is rightly proud of our valiant soldiers who have
dedicated their lives to defend our nation from external aggressors
and internal subversives. We believe it is our duty to take care of
our serving jawans and look after those who have retired from
service, as well as their families. To fulfil this duty, the BJP will
adopt the following programmes and policies:

1. The terms of service, including pay and allowances,
housing, education for children and pension, of all ranks
will be improved so as to attract men and women of high
calibre. The present shortage of men and officers does not
have to be met by lowering standards of entry;

2. Widows and dependents of jawans who die in action will
receive higher benefits and compensation;

3. Pension disparities will be solved and anomalies sorted
out expeditiously;

4. Hospitals for veterans will be set up throughout the country
so that no ex-serviceman, irrespective of his rank, is denied
medical care;

5. Ex-servicemen’s welfare will be included in the concurrent
list;

6. The services of our retired soldiers will be used to the
maximum extent possible, especially in insurgency-
affected areas. Wherever there is a stipulated percentage
for employing ex-servicemen, it will be fulfilled;

7. Necessary changes will be made in agricultural and urban
tenancy laws to secure the proprietary rights of servicemen;
and,

8. District Sainik Boards will be strengthened.

Illegal Immigration:
Demographic Invasion — A Threat to Our Security

We believe that illegal immigration from our neighbouring
countries, especially Bangladesh, has a direct impact on our nation’s
security and has an unsettling effect on our demography. Given
the sheer dimension of numbers there are as many as 1.7 crore
illegal immigrants, the bulk of them Bangladeshis, living in various

Untitled-10 278 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM

Election Manifestoes * 279

parts of the country. Illegal immigration is not only transforming
the geography, but the sociology, the economy, indeed even the
politics of this country. India is facing an explosive issue. If our
demographic balance is allowed to be disturbed by inept policies
and political considerations, various demographic entities are
bound to come in conflict, thus adversely affecting our security
environment. The invasion of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh
has led to an alarming growth ina section of the population in our
North-East, in Assam, in West Bengal, parts of Bihar and Delhi.
In certain areas, a section of the population has grown by almost
100 per cent.
The BJP proposes to:
1. Complete barbed wire fencing along the India-Bangladesh
border, beginning with the plains, to prevent infiltration;
2. Detect illegal immigrants, delete their names from voters’
lists and arrange for their deportation without any further
delay;
3. Declare all property deals between Indians and illegal
immigrants as null and void;
4. Amend immigration rules and other laws to impose
stringent checks on illegal entry into India; and,
5. Expedite the issuance of identity cards to all citizens o
the country.

Our Villages, Our Farmers,
Our Poor

Towards a Revitalised Rural Economy

Our country has an abundance of natural resources, fertile lands,
flowing rivers, rich mineral deposits and verdant forests. More
than anything else, we have a large army of farmers that shoulders
the onerous task of feeding our people. But the wrong priorities
of the last 50 years of Congress misrule and the lopsided model
of development pursued by policymakers have impoverished vast
sections of our farmers, rendering agriculture economically non-
viable. Worse, bulk of the monies earmarked for infrastructural
development, health, education and civic amenities has been
canalised to the urban areas despite the fact that the majority of
the population lives in villages.

Less than a quarter of the country’s population, 23.31 per
cent, lives in urban areas, compared to the overwhelming 76.69
per cent which lives in villages. As many as 71.4 per cent of our
people are economically dependent on agriculture: This sector
of our economy, therefore, generates the highest employment as
well as provides the biggest market. Yet, this sector continues to
be neglected by Congress policy-makers.

The Bharatiya Janata Party believes that India cannot emerge as
a powerful nation until the lot of our farmers is improved, adequate
attention paid to the agricultural sector, an all-out war launched
against poverty, and investments are made in agro-industry as well
as small-scale and cottage industry catering to the requirements
of our villages. Our country’s progress is linked to the well-being
of our villages, our farmers and our poor.

Congress’ Policy: Not to Have a Policy on Agriculture

In the absence of any well thought out agricultural policy
focussing on rural development and reconstruction, agriculture is
fast becoming a losing proposition for our farmers. While fixing
agricultural prices, successive Congress governments have not
taken into account the expenses incurred by our farmers on seeds,
fertiliser, power, water, pesticides, machinery and labour. No effort
has ever been made to bring about parity in the prices of industrial
and agricultural produce.

As a result, our farmers are forced to sell the fruit of their labour
at low prices even while they have to pay ever-increasing prices
for the necessary inputs. Not surprisingly, this has contributed to
the impoverishment and indebtedness of our farmers, pushing vast
sections of them dangerously close to or even below the Poverty
Line. According to the Planning Commission’s own estimates, almost
42 per cent of our rural population lives below the Poverty Line.

No less alarming is the fact that the number of our villagers
dependent on per acre of land has been steadily increasing,
compared to other countries where this dependency has dramatically
decreased with governments investing in agro-industry which offers
alternative sources of employment. No effort has been made to set
up an adequate number of small-scale and cottage industries in our
rural areas to absorb idle hands. This has also contributed in no
small measure to the impoverishment of our farmers. In 1950-51,
the ratio of the disparity between the per capita income in rural and
urban areas was 1:2; in 1995-96 it stood at 1:4. Similarly, while per
family income has risen by 52 per cent in urban areas since 1952,
it has increased by a mere 7.8 per cent in rural areas.

Ironically, these neglected villages form a vast market and from
this market, as much as Rs 48,000 crores flow to our urban areas
every year. By killing our villages, we will be destroying this market.
Conversely, by developing our villages, we will be strengthening
this market, which in turn will benefit our urban areas. In other
words, urban India cannot survive without rural India.

But this simple truth has been ignored for the last 50 years.
Today, three out of every four Indians live in villages, condemned
to a life of exploitation and increasing social, political and economic

marginalisation.

BJP’s Agenda For Our Farmers, Our Poor

We pledge to reverse this trend of social, political and economic
marginalisation of our rural population and empower our farmers.
We are committed to restoring agriculture to its rightful place
and thus steering our people into an era of prosperity and social
equality by the opening decade of the new century.

No country can be great if its people remain poor. Our first
task will be to wipe out the dark curse of poverty. We will allocate
greater resources for effective poverty alleviation programmes;
we will invest in agriculture and small-scale industry; we will
build from the bottom up, for that is the only way we can build
an enduring edifice of development.

To develop rural India, the BJP will:

1. Allocate 60 per cent of plan funds for agricultural and

rural development;

2. Treat villages as the basic unit of development and provide
each village with basic facilities like roads, irrigation,
drinking water, education, health and sanitation;
Provide shelter to the homeless in our villages;

»

4. Develop agriculture, enhance production and improve
living standards in our villages by
(a) Fixing agricultural prices after taking into account all

expenses incurred by farmers;
(b) Reducing the per acre cost of production;
(c) Increasing the average per acre production;
(d) Reducing the overall dependence on agriculture;
(e) Providing alternative employment to displaced farmers;

5. Give agriculture the same benefits as industry;

6. Set up an Agricultural Costs and Prices Commission in
which farmers and agricultural specialists will together
comprise two-thirds of the members. The Commission will
be autonomous and its recommendations will be binding;

7. Announce the total cost of inputs, the total expenditure
incurred by farmers, and thereafter announce the support
prices;

8. Link support prices to the price index;

Untitled-10 282 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM

Election Manifestoes * 283

9. Ensure parity between agricultural and industrial products
in respect of pricing;

10. Conduct extensive research to evolve methods of dryland
farming;

11. Give priority to the farmers’ interests while determining
the exim policy for agricultural produce;

12. Enforce prompt payment for agricultural produce. There
will be automatic interest addition to payments delayed
beyond two weeks;

13. Extend crop and animal insurance to all agricultural
produce. Insurance schemes will also cover natural
calamities;

14. Establish a chain of warehouses with facilities for grant of
advance payments of up to 80 per cent of the agricultural
produce deposited;

15. Encourage the use of fruit juice in the production of all
beverages;

16. Allow free movement of foodgrains throughout the country;

17. Free sugar industry from licensing, and production of
molasses from all restrictions on production and movement,
as well as ensure that farmers receive an adequate share
of the total prices;

18. Maintain the subsidy on fertilisers;

19. Improve the Public Distribution System;

20. Establish farmers’ service centres;

21. Give comprehensive documents to farmers which cover
land records, ownership and all other relevant papers;

22. Reform land acquisition laws and ensure that agricultural
land acquired for any purpose receives prompt and full
compensation at market rates;

23. Free bonded labour and rehabilitate them; and,

24. Launch employment guarantee schemes in rural India
that will cover the largest possible number of people.

To revive village industry, the BJP will:

1. Establish an extensive chain of tiny and small-scale
industrial units;

2. Give the greatest impetus to this sector. To make agriculture-
based sustainable, the BJP will sharpen the edge of agro

Untitled-10 283 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM

284 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

rural industries and food-processing;

3. Provide all facilities, including easy access to credit and
marketing to rural artisans and craftsmen;

4. Set up a National Artisan Development Bank;

Set up special institutes for skill upgradation; and,

6. Give a thrust to wasteland development, social forestry
and horticulture.

a

To provide irrigation facilities, the BJP will:

1. Launch time-bound irrigation projects and complete
ongoing projects;

2. Give priority to small and minor irrigation projects;

Remove disparities between districts within states;

»

4. Encourage the use of alternative sources of irrigation
through incentives and better water management;

5. Ensure that farmers are made to pay only for the water
they consume; and,

6. Draw up a master plan for flood control and harnessing
of flood waters for irrigation. Offer prompt compensation
for crops lost in floods.

To provide power for agriculture, the BJP will:

1. Encourage rapid electrification of our villages so that no
village is left without power by the turn of the century;

2. Ensure adequate supply of power for agricultural activity;

3. Set up small power stations and sub-stations in rural areas
for supplying power exclusively to villages; and,

4. Electricity Boards will be made to pay compensation to
farmers if they fail to supply assured quantity of power.
Similarly, farmers will be required to pay their power bill
on time,

To strengthen the cooperative movement, the BJP will:

1. Free cooperatives from political interference;

2. Prevent the intrusion of vested interests;

3. Simplify rules and regulations governing the functioning
of cooperative societies;

4, Make entry in passbooks mandatory for all money deposits;

Untitled-10 284 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM

Election Manifestoes * 285

5. Only those entirely dependent on agriculture will be
allowed to become members of farmers cooperative
societies; and,

6. Ensure free and timely elections to cooperative bodies.

To implement land reforms, the BJP will:

1. Enforce the implementation of Land Ceiling Laws in all
States;

2. Set up designated courts to expeditiously deal with all
land ceiling disputes and monitor enforcement of verdicts;

3. Expedite distribution of ceiling surplus land among landless
farmers;

4. Monitor the use of distributed land and prevent its
alienation from beneficiaries;.

ol

. Reclaim cultivable land lying fallow;

a

. Time-bound registration of all lands; and,
7. Decide ownership rights at the level of Gram Panchayats
without any delay.

To alleviate poverty, the BJP will:

1. Enhance public outlays for poverty alleviation and social
infrastructure;

2. Restructure the PDS, confining it only to the poor and
the needy. Burgeoning food stocks with a vastly reduced
off take and a decline in the per capita consumption of
cereals from PDS are powerful indicators of poverty rather
than the misleading inflation indices. PDS prices and the
regulated intervals of offtake will be suitably adjusted so
that the scheme becomes meaningful for fighting hunger
and malnutrition. PDS will also be dovetailed to provide
‘Food for Work’ in employment programmes linked with
poverty eradication;

3. Identify poverty through indexation reflecting not only the
level of consumption of calories but also the minimal social
infrastructure status such as literacy, housing, drinking
water, health and sanitation;

4. Implement ‘Antyodaya’ schemes throughout the country
because we hold that sustainable employment is at the core

Untitled-10 285 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM

286 * Party Document Vol-1

of poverty eradication. These Antyodaya schemes will be
targeted at the poorest of the poor: Five crore families will
be selected for immediate relief;

5. Allocate more resources for food-for-work programmes
so that they can be implemented round the year, as well
as monitor their implementation; and,

6. Introduce Langar Yojana and Annadan Yojana to ensure
that no man, woman or child goes hungry.

To ensure cow protection, the BJP will:

1. Impose a total ban on the slaughter of cows and cow
progeny by amending Article 48 of the Constitution to
cover bulls and bullocks, and prohibit all trading (state as
well as private) in the slaughter of cows and cow progeny;

2. Implement a policy for improved cattle-breeding; and,

3. Provide tax exemption to the income of Goshalas and
Pinjrapoles.

The BJP recognises the fact that from times immemorial, cow-
protection has remained one of the basics of Indian culture and
Indian agriculture, and it is on the patient back of the cow and its
progeny that the entire structure of Indian agriculture rests. Over
70 million animals are employed in farming operations in Indian
villages, more than 80% rural transport needs are met by the
bullock-cart. Our livestock is also an effective protection against
environmental degradation.

The BJP regretfully observes that millions of cows and cow
progeny are slaughtered every year, most of them for export.

Our Human Wealth

Literacy and Health For All

The Bharatiya Janata Party is committed to the creation of a Bharat
whose citizens will not suffer from the dual affliction of illiteracy and
malnutrition. We believe that the state should invest in developing
every citizen’s potential to contribute to the regeneration of our
country. To achieve that, we will stress on health and education,
both of which are challenges that have to be met by the first decade
of the 21st century. India has to emerge as a powerful, self-reliant
and proud nation. True development will be possible only when
we draw sustenance from our citizens; they are our true wealth.

Education
The past five years have witnessed this core area of human
resource development being increasingly deprived of state support.
As a result, quality education is fast becoming the preserve of the
social and economic elite of the country. The vast multitudes, who
have been victims of inequity, continue to be denied the cherished
ideal of literacy. The BJP will stress on providing equal opportunity
of education, literacy and information.
Towards this end, we will:
1. Increase state spending on education progressively to at
least six per cent of our Gross National Product;
2. Spend more on primary education and enrol the help of
non-government organisations in this area;
3. Provide free education in order to universalise access to
primary education;
4. Offer incentives in the form of free text books, nutrition
programmes and stipends to check dropout rate so that at

Untitled-10 287 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM

288 * Party Document Vol-1

least 80 per cent children, both boys and girls, who enrol
complete primary school education;

5. Reduce learning period and introduce self-employment
oriented vocational training programmes at high school
level;

6. Introduce an anti-cheating law which will be applicable
to all States and whose abuse will be prevented through
adequate safeguards;

7. Launch community-level adult education programmes to
provide functional literacy to at least 90 per cent of our
adult illiterates in both villages and the cities;

8. Set up a special monitoring authority to scrutinise the
quality of education and remove gender disparity;

9. Ensure autonomy to universities, encourage them to
mobilise resources for research and higher education, and
provide academic freedom to our scholars, especially in
the social sciences;

10. Improve the pay and emoluments of teachers at all levels
and remove anomalies in college/university promotion
rules;

11. Enrol industry’s help to set up more technical and
agro-industrial institutions that will provide affordable
education;

12. Abolish the system of capitation fees and monitor the
functioning of private engineering and medical institutions;

13. Launcha scheme for low interest bank loans for meritorious
students who want to go in for higher education; and,

14. Thwart attempts by foreign universities, colleges and
institutes of dubious reputation to open branches in India
and prevent the outflow of foreign exchange on studies
abroad unless the course is relevant to our needs and
requirements.

Health

We believe in increasing state investment in health and
nutrition programmes because this is the only path to the creation
of a productive workforce by the beginning of the next century.
Our goal will be health for all. Towards this end, we will strive for:

Untitled-10 288 11/7/2016 11:19:38 PM

Election Manifestoes * 289

1. Ending the scourge of malnutrition;

2. Drastically reducing our infant mortality rate and underfive
mortality rate by spending more on pre-natal and pos-natal
health care programmes;

3. Immunising every child against killer diseases;

4. Providing every panchayat with a free primary health care
centre with facilities for mother and child care, as well as
access to these centres;

5. Canalising a substantial portion of the health care allocation
on preventive rather than curative aspects;

6. Promoting awareness on cleanliness and disease prevention;

7. Re-evaluating existing programmes to tackle sexually
transmitted diseases, with special focus on AIDS;

8. Making the screening of blood at blood banks mandatory
and provide for punitive punishment for any violation;

9. Holding doctors, para-medical and non-medical staff at
government hospitals and health care centres accountable
and instituting a mechanism for swift disposal of all
complaints;

10. Revising pay and emoluments of staff at Government
hospitals and health care centre to attract the best talent;

11. Promoting alternative medical sciences with special
emphasis on Ayurveda and Unani systems;

12. Protecting traditional medicinal plants, trees and cures;

13. Preventing drug prices from escalating to a point where
they become non-affordable for the masses;

14. Introducing health insurance schemes at a minimal cost
to the subscriber; and,

15. Instituting a mechanism to monitor and collate healthrelated
information.

Our Population Policy

Towards a Sustainable and Balanced Growth

Our people are our primary concern — their basic needs of health,
education and employment must precede everything else. To ensure
an equitable disbursement of resources so that the largest number
of our people benefit from development policies, we must arrest the
country’s runaway population and growth. An increasing population
can only mean a decreasing share of the fruits of development.
Successive Congress Governments have ignored this crucial area
of development planning, often for petty political motives. This
has resulted in a steep rise in population and severe demographic
imbalances. The Bharatiya Janata Party believes that children
are born — and have the right — to be happy, and not merely
for existence. We will, therefore, put population-related issues,
especially family planning, firmly back on the national agenda, and
launch a people’s movement against the impending population
explosion through persuasive policies. The BJP proposes to:

1. Act on the reports of the National Development Council
and the Swaminathan Committee to formulate a National
Population Policy that will stabilise the population growth
by the first decade of the new century;

2. Enact a law that will debar those with more than two
children from holding elected office, with 1996 as the
cutoff year;

3. Provide incentives to those among the economically
weaker sections who opt for the ‘two-child’ norm in the
form of special facilities for health, education, nutrition
and employment opportunities. At the same time, the BJP
will also introduce disincentives like limiting subsidised

Untitled-10 293 11/7/2016 11:19:39 PM

294 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

ration and maternity benefits to two children with 1996
as the cut-off year. These disincentives will apply to all
sections of society, irrespective of their social, economic or
religious status to discourage large, unsustainable families;

4. Ensure universal access to family planning information
and quality facilities by involving non-government
organisations, and promote awareness among the people,
especially women, through counselling and educational
programmes

5. Introduce family planning methods and facilities that will
allow women greater freedom of choice without imperilling
their health;

6. Launch a special campaign for women to seek about
negative practices and encourage reproductive health
services;

7. Offer a special incentive in the form of a fixed deposit that
will mature in 21 years for those couples who have only
a girl child under a ‘Dattak Putri Yojana’.

8. Make family planning an integral part of policies to ensure
widest applicability of these incentives and disincentives.

Our Environment

Only One Earth

The BJP holds as a firm conviction that our ‘only one Earth’ is the
endower of all our wealth and natural resources. This, however, is
not for endless exploitation. Our environment has to be protected,
not only to prevent the sanctity of Mother Earth from being
profaned but also because our forests, our rivers and our skies
sustain a multitude of lives. No less important is the crucial role that
environment plays in our nation’s security. Environment must be
protected by subscribing to the concept of ‘sustainable development’,
a philosophical tenet that is integral to our civilisational and cultural
consciousness. The BJP will:

1. Introduce a National Environment Policy incorporating
a healthy balance between development needs and
preservation of natural resources. The interests of and
consultation with states will be fully ensured. To implement
the policy, the Ministry of Environment and Forests will
be recast as the Ministry for Ecological Security;

2. Implement better management and harnessing of river
waters as well as sources of ground water;

3. Control land, air and water pollution by industry and
urban centres. Municipal sewage treatment plants will
be made obligatory;

4. Formulate a programme for developing sustainable cities,
with special emphasis on waste management and use of
natural resources like water;

5. Make environment studies a part of school, college and
university curriculum and make environment issues an
integral part of the visual media so that our children

develop a caring and protective attitude towards the
ecological system that sustains our lives;

6. Protect the traditional and other rights of Vanvasis and
Girijans over forest resources and produce;

7. Involve local self-governments at all levels, both in villages
and cities, in implementing the National Policy;

8. Provide easy access to information on conservation and
sustainable use of natural resources;

9. Ban the import of hazardous chemical wastes for recycling
by any industry or for dumping;

10. Minimise the use of non-biodegradable material for
packaging by the consumer non-durable products industry;

11. It will restrain the conversion of forests or grazing areas
for other purposes;

12. Adopt aforestation policies to be fulfilled within a given
timeframe and prevent the degradation of forests by
natural or manmade causes. The cornerstone of the BJP’s
forest policy will be a part of the total framework of
land management, adoption of a dynamic programme
of productive forestry and moving to private investment
in forestry from total state management of forests. A
programme will also be drawn up for the conversion of
degraded forests, wasteland and marginal land into quality
forests;

13. Deny exploitation of offshore resources, especially marine
life, by big trawlers;

14. Promote R&D in environment-related studies and eco-
technology for application in agriculture, industry and
the services sector;

15. Provide incentives to manufacturers of eco-friendly
products;

16. Not sanction tourism-related projects that disturb the
environment and cause degradation.

Our Social Philosophy

Harmony and Equality through Integral Humanism

The Bharatiya Janata Party’s social philosophy, which is the bedrock
of its social agenda, is rooted in integral humanism. It rules out
contradictions between society and its various components, as also
between society and the individual, or, for that matter, between
the family, the basic building brick of our social structure, and the
individual. From this stems the BJP’s commitment to the eradication
of social and economic disparities that have prevented India from
emerging as a modern, dynamic nation; to the creation of a socially
integrated Bharatiya society which can proudly enter the new
century. The BJP will help all socially and economically weak and
backward sections of society, through special welfare and other
schemes, to reach their full potential, For us, it is a historic task
which we are resolved to fulfil.

Equity and Equality

1. The BJP will adhere, through its policies and programmes,
to the ideals, principles and goals of equity and equality
as enshrined in our country’s Constitution;

2. The BJP will promote a casteless socio-economic order
which will effectively provide access to equal opportunities
to all citizens, irrespective of their caste, creed, religion or
gender;

3. The BJP will ensure that the place of an individual in society
will not be determined on the basis of his birth; and

4. The BJP will dismantle practices, customs, beliefs, usages
and institutions which are divisive and discriminatory, and
which in any manner hurt the dignity of the individual.

Untitled-10 297 11/7/2016 11:19:39 PM

298 * Party Document Vol-1

Untouchability

1. The BJP condemns unequivocally the practice of
untouchability which is not only against the law of the
land but runs counter to the very concept of integral
humanism. Not surprisingly, the first brick of the Ram
temple at Ayodhya was laid by a member of the Scheduled
Castes, Kameshwar Chaupal.

2. The BJP will endeavour to create an ethos of equality in
social and inter-personal relationships.

Weaker Sections

1. The BJP will make the existing institutions and Constitutional
safeguards for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
operationally more effective.

2. The BJP views the provision of special facilities and special
opportunities, including reservations, in the Constitution
as practical steps to advance the deprived and under-
privileged sections of society. The BJP will continue with
the existing policy on reservations till social and economic
equity is achieved.

Our Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes

The BJP’s goal is to achieve social equality for all Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes through political and economic
empowerment. To achieve this goal, the BJP will:

1. Stringently enforce laws against untouchability;

2. Inquire into all cases of atrocities, publish the findings,
punish the guilty and rehabilitate the victims as
expeditiously as possible;

3. Lay stress on education, vocational training and skill
upgradation;

4. Take prompt action to fill up the backlog in jobs reserved for
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The reservations
policy will be backed up with a statute;

5. Set up a financial agency on the lines of NABARD to
cater to the individual and institutional credit needs of
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes;

Untitled-10 298 11/7/2016 11:19:39 PM

8. Wipe out the evil of bonded and child labour and
rehabilitate the victims;

9. Launch a massive housing programme for the homeless
in villages;

10. Allot pattas for land, home site and homes in the name of
wives/widows/ daughters;

11. Take necessary steps to protect tribals from exploitation,
especially by contractors, and indebtedness;

12. Amend the existing forest policy to restore to the Vanvasis
their rightful share of forest wealth and produce, as well
as provide viable marketing facilities;

13. Expedite the processing of the claims of Vanvasis and
Girijans for pattas in forest and hill areas;

14. Disallow the diversion of monies from Plan and Tribal
SubPlan funds meant for the welfare and development
of Vanvasis and Girijans;

15. Prevent land alienation through conversion of tribal lands
for industrial and other purposes;

16. Formulate and implement a National Policy for the
rehabilitation of families displaced by development
projects. This rehabilitation policy will be multi-dimensional
and not merely provide financial compensation or
means of livelihood. Governed by the principle of ‘total
rehabilitation’, it will include social, economic, educational,
environmental, occupational and cultural aspects.

17. Encourage the setting up of inter-state regional coordination
councils to implement a common welfare programme for
tribals living in contiguous areas of neighbouring states.

18. Erect a befitting memorial in honour of Maharishi Valmiki
and Babasaheb Ambedkar in the national Capital.

Our Socially and Educationally Backwards

The BJP is committed to providing both social and economic
justice to the socially and educationally backward classes (Other
Backward Classes) through the instrument of reservations. At the
same time, we hold that the path to progress of all sections of our
people lies not through social divisions brought about by casteist
politics but through social harmony. The BJP advocates:

1. Continuation of reservations for the Other Backward
Classes till they are socially and educationally integrated
with the rest of society;

2. A uniform criterion for demarcating the ‘creamy layer’;

3. Flow of reservation benefits in an ascending order so that
the most backward sections of the OBCs get them first;

4. Ten per cent reservation on the basis of economic criteria
to all economically weaker sections of society, apart from
the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and the Other
Backward Classes; and,

5. Special programmes to provide education and vocational
training as well as awareness campaigns.

Enabling Our Disabled

As many as five crore of our people have been socially,
politically and economically marginalised because of their physical
and other disabilities. Successive Congress governments have not
only abdicated their responsibility towards these less fortunate of
our citizens, but also resisted their empowerment and, therefore,
their inclusion in the national mainstream. The level of official
apathy can be gauged from the fact that during the last year of its
tenure, the Rao Government allocated Rs 42 crore for the welfare
of the disabled, which works out to Rs 8 per person.

The BJP believes that those who have been excluded from
playing a participatory role in the nation-building process by
being stigmatised as ‘disabled’, should be empowered so that they
become productive, proud citizens of our country. Towards this
end, we propose to:

1. Order a special survey to collect data about the number

of people who are physically and otherwise disabled and

Untitled-10 300 11/7/2016 11:19:40 PM

Election Manifestoes * 301

the nature of their disability;

2. Use this data to formulate policies aimed at empowerment

rather than merely welfare;

Actively campaign to remove social prejudices;

4. Sensitise the bureaucracy to the needs and aspirations of
the disabled people;

5. Provide employment in all suitable categories of government
service through a policy of equal opportunity;

6. Give incentives to the private sector to provide disabled
people with job opportunities;

7. Offer medical, counselling and rehabilitation facilities at
health care centres by increasing budgetary allocation
and encouraging state governments to make a matching
contribution; and,

8. Ensure that disabled people have access to public utilities
and services.

Our Minorities

Wherever and whenever the Bharatiya Janata Party has been in
power, it has ensured peace and security for all sections of society,
irrespective of their religious identity. The BJP is committed to
further strengthen this achievement. This is in stark contrast to the
insecurity faced by minority communities under Congress rule.
We have been steadfastly opposed to appeasement as state policy
since it benefits only those sections which profess regressive and
retrograde social norms in the guise of protecting their religious
beliefs. The BJP will be guided by its policy of ‘justice for all,
appeasement of none’. A resurgent India will enter the 21st century
with the resolve of one nation, one people and one culture. To
achieve this goal, we will:

1. Guarantee all minority communities equal opportunity
for economic development;

2. Lay stress on education and vocational training;

3. Provide incentives to those who are self-employed,
especially artisans, and those who want to set up their
own business enterprise;

4. Launch community programmes to create awareness
among women members of minority communities;

Untitled-10 301 11/7/2016 11:19:40 PM

302 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

5. Ensure equality for all and discrimination against none on
grounds of religion in matters of education by amending
Article 30;

6. Disband the Minorities Commission and entrust its
responsibilities to the National Human Rights Commission;

7. Set up special courts for speedy trial of those accused of
participating in communal riots;

8. Protect wakf property from being usurped and misused
by unscrupulous individuals and organisations and help
wakf boards to become self-sustaining bodies so that they
do not have to be dependent on government doles;

9. Set up trusts along the line of the Tirupati Temple Trust
with official nominees for managing the affairs of dargahs;

10. Ensure that no religious property is misused or usurped;

11. Ban all foreign funds irrespective of the organisation which
is the recipient;

12. Make fraudulent conversions, including those done by
holding out the promise of economic or social benefits,
punishable offence and introduce a system of registering
all conversions;

13. Ban the publication of job advertisements that mention
religious identity as a criterion; and,

14. Set up a Commission of Inquiry (similar to the Neogi
Commission) to inquire into the activities of foreign
missionaries and other organisations that have been
receiving foreign funds.

Human Rights

The BJP subscribes to the view that human dignity, justice
for all and protection of the individual from the tyranny of the
state are among the basic tenets of Hindutva. We are committed
to upholding the human, democratic and civil rights of every
individual, irrespective of the person’s caste, creed, religion or
gender. But, we will not allow this commitment to be used as a
shield by those who commit inhuman atrocities and thus forsake
their claim to human rights. The BJP believes that the state should
be fair to all citizens, but firm while dealing with those who militate
against civil society. The BJP will not allow any foreign interference

Untitled-10 302 11/7/2016 11:19:40 PM

Election Manifestoes * 303

in our country’s internal affairs on the pretext of monitoring human
rights violations. We will:

1. Strengthen the existing National Human Rights Commission
through more powers, additional resources and better
infrastructural support;

2. Disband the Minorities Commission, which has only
succeeded in feeding separatist sentiments and giving rise
to imagined grievances, and entrust its responsibilities to
the National Human Rights Commission;

3. Take swift action on the basis of the Commissions findings
and punish the guilty; and,

4. Include the study of human, democratic and civil rights
in school curricula.

Displaced Communities: Protecting their Rights

Separatist violence and Islamic fundamentalism/ terrorism in
Jammu and Kashmir has forced more than 300,000 people, including
250,000 Kashmiri Pandits and Punjabi and Dogra Hindus, apart
from thousands of Sikhs and even some Muslims, to flee their
homes and hearths. Most of the displaced Pandits are living in
abysmal conditions in refugee camps in Jammu and other parts
of the country. Together, they perhaps form the largest internally
displaced community in the world, forced to live as refugees in
their own motherland, condemned to the mercy of an uncaring
and callous Congress government at the Centre and its puppet
administration in Jammu and Kashmir. The Bharatiya Janata Party
has mobilised its own resources, men and material to provide
succour to these unfortunate victims of government apathy and
terrorist violence. But a lot more needs to be done.

Similarly, thousands of Buddhist Chakmas have fled the
Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh in the face of persecution by
Muslim settlers from the plains and the Bangladesh Rifles. Most of
them are at present living in camps in Tripura. Regardless of the
grim future that awaits them back home, the Government of India
has shown unnecessary haste in trying to repatriate them —an action
that is largely motivated by the petty politics of the Congress. The
BJP is opposed to such forced repatriation in the absence of foolproof
security guarantees from the Government of Bangladesh.

Untitled-10 303 11/7/2016 11:19:40 PM

The escalating conflict in Sri Lanka between Sinhalese and
Tamils is posing a demographic threat to South India with a large
number of Tamil refugees beginning to pour into this region. Such
a movement is bound to increase the influence of the LTTE which
may, in turn, promote separatist tendencies.

We must also address ourselves to the concerns of nonresident
Indians, especially those who had settled in Hong Kong and now
find the future uncertain with Britain handing over this territory
to China in 1997.

The BJP proposes:
For Kashmiri Pandits

1. As urged by them for social cohesion and cultural
preservation, designate the Pandits who have been
forced out of Kashmir Valley as an internally displaced
community.

2. Provide adequate financial relief, proper health, housing,
education and employment facilities on a priority basis to
all displaced families.

3. Take adequate steps to protect their assets and properties
in Kashmir Valley till such time they are able to return
home.

4. Elections in the Valley should be held only after the
displaced people are able to return to their homes.

5. Ensure proper documentation of the displaced Pandits
and their assets.

For Chakma refugees

1. Resettle Chakma refugees, the bulk of whom are at present
in Tripura, in camps in other contiguous States and provide
financial support to their governments so that they do not
have to take on the economic burden.

2. Provide full citizenship to those Chakmas who do not
want to return to Bangladesh and whose children were
born in India.

3. Negotiate with Bangladesh for the phased repatriation
of those Chakmas who want to return, provided Dhaka

Untitled-10 304 11/7/2016 11:19:40 PM

Election Manifestoes * 305

guarantees their safety and well-being.

4. Ensure full security for the Chakmas who live in refugee
camps so that they are not harassed or threatened.

5. Maintain an official register of Chakma refugees and their
whereabouts.

For Sri Lankan Tamil refugees
1. House them in refugee camps and monitor their movements.
2. Prevent their association with local organisations or opening
local chapters of Sri Lankan organisations.
3. Screen the antecedents of the Tamil refugees and disallow
asylum to those who have or had links with Tamil terrorists.
Maintain a register of all such refugees.

ol

Repatriate Tamil refugees as soon as the situation is
conducive for their safe-being.

For non-resident Indians
1. Provide citizenship to those Hong Kong based Indians
who wish to return to their motherland.
2. Help rehabilitate the returning Hong Kong based Indians.
3. Examine afresh difficulties in granting dual citizenship to
non-resident Indians all over the world.

Our Identity, Our Culture

The Cornerstone of Bharatiyata

The Bharatiya Janata Party believes that modernisation does not
mean the mechanical imitation of a particular way of life. It will
redefine the concept of development to accommodate the Bharatiya
way of living, belief system and values to reach the ultimate goal
of Bharatiyata. We hold that it is necessary to emphasise the
linkage of development elements to cultural elements, including
local relevance, relevance to geographical and environmental
factors, historical traditions, traditional knowledge and skills. We
believe that cultural factors play an important role in energising
a nation. For a resurgent India whose people can proudly flaunt
their Bharatiyata, the BJP will:

Untitled-10 306

1. Strengthen and revitalise our cultural institutions;

2. Revive and rejuvenate our positive cultural traditions and
values;

3. Include Indian cultural studies and ‘Naitik Siksha’ as part
of school curriculum;

4. Establish a Bharatiya Sanskriti Kendra in each district;

5. Declare all places of pilgrimage as national heritage centres;

6. Encourage the study of Sanskrit and strictly enforce the
three-language formula in schools;

7. Promote Bharatiya classical music and performing arts
through state support; and,

8. Discourage indecent representation of women in
advertisements and publications; young minds. Sex and
violence on the silver screen are beginning to gnaw at the
moorings of our cultural ethos.

To check this abuse of popular cinema, the BJP will:

11/7/2016 11:19:41 PM

Election Manifestoes * 307

1. Provide film-making the status of industry so that producers
can be made accountable for their resources and expenses;

2. Enable film-makers through suitable provisions in law
to raise resources from financial institutions to curb the
influence of underworld financiers and mafia dons;

3. Analogous to the concept of the Customs ‘green channel’,
provide automatic certification for films which do not
contain explicit scenes and dialogues of violence and
sexproducers and exhibitors of such films will not have to
wait in the queue for Censor Board clearance. Deterrent
punishment will be meted out to any producer who abuses
the facility; theatre owners who screen such films will also
be penalised;

4. Exempt quality films, which will be certified as ‘Q’ from
entertainment tax;

5. Encourage viewers to form local Darshak Sanghs — on the
lines of consumer organisations — to monitor the quality
of films being screened in their area;

6. Set up special theatres at district headquarters and
metropolitan cities for screening art and quality films;

7. Appoint 50 per cent women on the Censor Board and
Censor Panels;

8. Create a special fund for promoting regional cinema; and,

9. Introduce legislation to ensure minimum wages and
retirement benefits for film extras and crew members.

Our Youth — Our Future

In the Vanguard of Change

Our youth form the backbone of our vibrant nation and they
alone can shape the destiny of this country. The BJP has a tryst
with the youth of India and will harness their creative energy for
bringing about social, cultural and political change. We will aim
at transforming Yuva Sankalpa into Yuva Shakti, which, in turn,
will be the catalyst for reinvigorating India.

We will inculcate in the country’s youth a sense of pride in
our ancient traditions and heritage. We will instil in them a sense
of self-confidence so that they can take their rightful place in the
vanguard of change.

Towards this end, through its policies and programmes, the
BJP will:

1. Inculcate in the youth a sense of being indebted to society
at large and thus prepare them to repay this debt by
involving themselves in development programmes and
social, cultural and economic activities;

2. Initiate schemes both at Government and Non-Government
levels to achieve overall development of young talent;

3. Mobilise the youth to fight regressive and retrograde
social practices and customs by making community
service a compulsory and integral component of college
and university curricula;

4. Set up a National Youth Commission and a Youth
Development Bank to design and implement comprehensive
employment oriented education policies as well channelise
youth power for the purpose of nation-building;

5. Encourage the youth to form ‘Yuva Sena’ and ‘Dharti

Untitled-10 308 11/7/2016 11:19:41 PM

Raksha Vahini’ for voluntary community service with the
ultimate aim of generating employment;

6. Launch a massive self-enterprise programme to provide
employment opportunities to the educated unemployed;

7. Allocate adequate time for youth programmes on
Doordarshan;

8. Promote sports through enhanced expenditure on training
and rehabilitate sportsmen after they retire from the field;

9. Establish a network of youth hostels throughout the country
and provide travel concessions; and,

10. Encourage the study of yoga and promote our cultural

heritage by incorporating them in educational curriculum.

Our Achievements

Peace, Progress and Prosperity

Wherever and whenever the Bharatiya Janata Party has formed
a state government, it has provided the people with a caring,
fair, clean and strong administration. The emphasis of our state
governments, be it in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi or Maharashtra
(where it shares power with the Shiv Sena), or earlier in Uttar
Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, has been on
ensuring peace, progress and prosperity.

The distinctive feature of our State Governments is their
singular achievement in curbing communal and caste conflict. This
is in stark contrast to the situation that prevails in States ruled by
the Congress or the Janata Dal where the law and order machinery
has virtually collapsed. A shining example of our achievement on
this front is the communal peace that prevails in Maharashtra which
till recently was wrecked by riots and social conflict. Similarly, the
BJP government in Gujarat has ensured peace.

This has been achieved by cracking down on anti-social and
anti-national activity. The underworld mafia, which flourished under
Congress rule, has been brought to book. The criminal-politician
nexus has been broken. Blackmarketeers, and other criminals, who
survived because of Congress patronage, have been put behind
bars or are facing prosecution.

The emphasis on enforcing law and order is not without reason.
For, unless there is peace, there cannot be progress and prosperity.

In the field of development, our state governments have
focused their attention on the rural sector, because the majority
of our people live in the villages. Not only have effective steps
been taken to solve the problems of our farmers, but innovative

Untitled-10 310 11/7/2016 11:19:41 PM

Election Manifestoes * 311

schemes have been introduced to generate employment and fight
the scourge of poverty.

For instance, the BJP government in Rajasthan has earmarked
more than 60 % of Plan allocation for rural areas. As many as
12.86 lakh farmers and artisans have benefited from the state
government's decision to write off loans amounting to more than
Rs 300 crores. The state government has also written off irrigation
loans amounting to Rs 124 crores and introduced more effective
means of irrigation. Tax relief on seeds, a wide range of agricultural
produce and equipment has further helped the farmers. Similarly,
the state government has reduced sales tax on fertlizers and made
a five-fold increase in agricultural loans.

On the social front, the government has introduced innovative
schemes like Gopal Gram Yojana and Saraswati Yojana. The first
scheme not only aims at improving the quality of livestock but also
providing people with a sustained income. Similarly, Saraswati
Yojana has a two-fold purpose: Universalising primary education
and providing employment to the educated youth of the villages.
Schemes like Shiksha Karmi Project and Guru-Mitra Yojana have
also contributed immensely to increasing literacy levels. Vikalp, a
specially designed family planning programme based on incentives
and which protects the girl child, has been immensely successful.

The Rajasthan Government has also introduced a new industrial
policy to attract both Indian and foreign investors. The policy has
already begun to pay rich dividends. The government has signed
MOUs for the setting up of new power plants. Soon, the state shall
have the largest solar power plant.

In Gujarat, the BJP government has maintained communal
harmony in the trouble-prone areas. Latif, a notorious criminal
involved in bootlegging and anti-social activities, has been
put behind bars. His underworld activities in the border areas
of Kutch and Saurashtra have come to a grinding halt. Those
involved in adulteration of petrol with solvents, which had
become an extremely profitable crime during Congress rule, are
facing prosecution.

With law and order restored, the state government has turned
its attention on development activity. Work on the Sardar Sarovar
Project is progressing at a remarkable speed. Bonds worth Rs 300

Untitled-10 311 11/7/2016 11:19:42 PM

312 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

crores were issued and the amount obtained in seven days from
the cooperative sector. Simultaneously, those displaced because
of the project have been rehabilitated,

On the industrial front, the state government has adopted an
investor-friendly policy which has evoked a tremendous response.
An increasing number of Non-Resident Indians have begun to
show keen interest in investing in Gujarat. At the same time,
the interests of the agricultural sector are not being ignored. For
instance, 42 % of the power generated in the state is channelised
for agricultural use, compared to 34 % for industry. New power
plants are being commissioned to meet future requirements. In
the last three years of Congress rule, not a single MW was added
to the installed capacity.

On the social front, the state government has reduced bus fares
by 20%, a move which has brought tremendous relief to millions
of people. Poor families are being provided with wheat at Rs 2 per
kg. More than 40 lakh families have already been covered by this
poverty alleviation scheme.

The biggest success of the Gujarat Government has been the
Gokul Gram Yojana, a scheme to develop the villages and provide
a better quality of life to villagers. The aim is to make the 18,090
villages of the State self-reliant and provide them with basic
facilities ranging from roads to drinking water to schools and proper
sanitation. Since this is a participatory model of development, the
government has sought the people’s participation. The response
has been tremendous: Even NRIs have come forward to contribute
to the scheme.

To empower women, the state government has introduced
schemes like Kuvarbai-nu-Mameru and Ghar Divda. Daughters of
poor families receive financial support at the time of their marriage.
Tribal girls have been provided with bicycles so that they can attend
school. The Daridra Narayan Yojana has encouraged children from
poor families to attend school. Under this scheme, children get free
uniforms and books in addition to monetary incentives.

On the agricultural front, farmers are now allowed to buy
land in any part of the state. New insurance policies have been
introduced to provide extensive cover. The quality of seeds,
pesticides and fertilizers has been improved and there has been

Untitled-10 312 11/7/2016 11:19:42 PM

Election Manifestoes * 313

a three-fold increase in the allocation for drip irrigation. Farmers
today get adequate power supply.

In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena-BJP Government has spared
no effort to break the vicious grip which the mafia had established
over the administration. The law and order machinery has been
strengthened and the police made accountable.

In Maharashtra, too, the emphasis has been on restoring law
and order and implementing schemes aimed at providing a better
quality of life for the people. This is most obvious in the rural areas
where even small farmers today are provided with power for their
pumps and insurance cover for their crops. The government has
undertaken a massive programme to provide drinking water to
every village.

To protect the poor from inflation, the state government has
frozen the prices of five essential commodities. The poorest of the
poor are covered by the jhunka-bhakar scheme: For a rupee, a
person can have a meal. Those who cannot afford to pay for health
care, have been provided with free health services. Meritorious
students from poor families are being provided with all incentives
to ensure that they do not drop out of schools. A programme has
been adopted to provide free housing to 40 lakh slum-dwellers in
Mumbai.

The state government has initiated steps to ensure that those
who perpetrate crimes against women are punished immediately.
Kamdhenu Yojana provides women with sustained employment.
For the girl child, a special scheme has been introduced to ensure
that her education and health care needs are taken care of. The
Maharashtra Government has taken the first bold step to dismantle
the practice of polygamy.

Above all the state government has restored probity in public
life: They have provided the people with a clean and transparent
administration. The Enron deal was scrapped because the cost was
inflated. A committee of experts renegotiated the deal with Enron
and the new agreement has resulted in savings worth Rs 25,000
crores. The cost per unit of power has also been brought down by
54 paise The biggest gain is that by bringing down the project cost,
the Maharashtra Government has set new parameters for power
projects elsewhere in the country.

The BJP Government in Delhi has achieved the unique
distinction of fulfilling 94 of the 100 promises which the party
had made within two years. This despite the fact that the state
government is hamstrung by restrictions imposed by the Union
Government. The focus has been on improving the quality of life
of a common man.

The BJP had promised that if voted to power, it would pursue
the prosecution of those involved in the November 1984 anti-Sikh
riots. We are proud of the fact that our government has successfully
reopened the investigations which were suppressed by the Congress.
Some of the guilty people have been brought to book. The others
will also be brought to justice.

The BJP Government has provided Delhi with a corruption-free
administration. Several steps have been taken to end ‘inspector raj’
and simplify rules and regulations. Schemes have been introduced
for employment generation and to encourage entrepreneurs. Those
living in slums have been provided with basic amenities.

These are only some of our achievements, the highlights of our
governments’ performance. Much more remains to be done and we
are committed to completing the task we have set for ourselves.

Let’s Commence A New Chapter

This then is the blueprint which the Bharatiya Janata Party will
implement on coming to power. The task will be undertaken by
the party’s inspiring team of leaders, each one of whom has an
unmblemished record of self-less service to the nation. It is through
this blueprint that the BJP will bring about radical change in the
country’s polity, society and economy. It is this blueprint which
will be the bedrock of a new India where every citizen shall be free
from fear, hunger and discrimination. This blueprint will pave the
way to the next century and the new millennium.

But to implement our commitments we need your support. The
sweeping change that has become so necessary to save the nation
can be brought about only with your help. To begin with, you
have to change the leadership at the helm of the country’s affairs
and vote out the Congress. The time has arrived for a nationalist
government which will lead India from the dark curse of poverty
to prosperity; which will free the administration from the clutches
of criminals and restore probity in public life; which will reinvest
the state with authority and strengthen our security forces; and,
which will secure our country’s frontiers so that we do not have
to suffer once again the humiliations of this millennium. Such a
government can be provided only by the BJP.

The past five decades have been a tragic story of missed
opportunities and self-serving opportunist politics. The Congress
has abused power and authority for the benefit of few and to the
detriment of millions of Indians. The leaders of the Janata Dal have
demonstrated their inability to think beyond themselves. The Left
parties, orphaned by the passing away of Communism all over the
world, are struggling to come to terms with an ideological vacuum.

Untitled-10 315 11/7/2016 11:19:42 PM

None of these parties can boast of ideological commitment, moral
courage and political conviction. On the other hand, the BJP has
emerged as the only national alternative, a party that stands apart
for its ideology, commitment and courage.

We are standing at an important crossroad of our nation’s
history. The BJP appeals to all patriotic Indians to join the noble
mission of national reconstruction — the task of creating a strong
and prosperous India. Let us be partners in a new era of equality,
peace and progress.

This We Believe

The country stands today ona major cross-roads of history. A right
turn - and the country would be well on its way to fulfilment. A
wrong turn - and the country would be in serious trouble.

The electoral contests so far have been mainly bouts between
various shades of Congressmen. Today for the first time Bharatiya
Janata Party the Party of Independent India, offers itself as an
independent and complete alternative to the current confusions.

The country has been advancing at snail’s pace when it has
not actually been declining. Prices are rising and employment
generation rate is falling. The foreign debt trap is closing on us.
Communal violence has rocked several States. For the first time
in history we had immolations by the frustrated flower of Indian
youth. State-Centre relations are seriously strained. Opportunistic
alliances have brought Democracy itself into disrepute. Secessionism
has raided its ugly head in Punjab, Kashmir and Assam. And what
is worse, there is sinister cooperation between these separatist
terrorists and the people’s war group in Andhra and LTTE in Tamil
Nadu. In the face of this challenge, other parties have gone casteist
communalist or both.

Different Political Parties exploited even the tragic Gulf War
to carve out and corner communal vote banks. The leaders of these
parties have conclusively proved themselves non-leaders. Taking
advantage of this confusion, communists are making attempts to
gain some respectability. .

The Bharatiya Janata Party as the party of Nationalism,
Holism and Integral Humanism, offers a complete, new and higher
alternative to the current dismal scene. As the party of Swadesh
and Swa-dharma, it is wedded to our country, our people and

Untitled-10 319 11/7/2016 11:19:43 PM

320 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

our culture. It believes in consensus and cooperation, and not in
contrariety and conflict. It would uplift the poor and the down-
trodden, without pitting caste against caste, without inciting class
against class.

As the party of law, order and justice, it would ensure the
security of life, limb and honour of all citizens. It seeks the restoration
of Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya only by way of a symbolic
righting of historic wrongs, so that the old unhappy chapter of
acrimony could be ended, and a Grand National Reconciliation
effected. Hindus and Muslims are blood-brothers. But on account
of historical reasons their relationship has not been harmonious.
It shall be the endeavor of BJP to make all Indians fraternal and
friendly once again.

BJP is no prisoner of any dogmas. We will debureaucratise the
Economy to maximise production. We will make even the Sarkari
Sector productive and profitable by throwing open some of the
public sector units to people’s participation.

The BJP will modernise the country on the basis of Science
and Technology, even while strengthening the cultural roots of
our national life. We want to do a thousand things to uplift the
people and upgrade the country. And we have the first Principles,
the sound policies, the wise leadership and the dedicated cadres
to do them and do them well.

Towards A Clean Political System

From the Himalaya to Kanya Kumari, this country has
always been one. We have had many States, but we were always
one people. We always looked upon our country as Matribhoomi,
Punyabhoomi. The Atharva Veda says ‘Janarn bibhrati bahuda
vivachasam’ -Nana Dharmanam Prithvi yathou kasam.’

(This our motherland gives equal protection to people speaking
different languages and professing different faiths).

We have never had a theocracy, with a State Religion, in
India. In fact, it is not possible in India because of its inherent
magnanimous cultural heritage. This being our tradition there is
no room for discrimination against anybody on grounds of caste,
creed, language or region. It is the duty of the state to ensure justice
for all citizens and for all sections of society. The Bharatiya Janata

Untitled-10 320 11/7/2016 11:19:43 PM

Election Manifestoes * 321

Party is wedded to National Unity and National Integrity and a
balanced development of all regions and all sections. To these ends
we will have, politically, not only a strong centre but also strong
autonomous States.

Law And Constitution

The polity will accordingly, be reformed along the following

lines:

1. BJP favours restructuring of Centre-State relations in view
of the quick economic development and decentralisation.
BJP will implement the Sarkaria Committee Report on
Centre-State relations;

2. Article 356 permitting dissolution of a State Government
by the Centre, will invoke only when the Constitutional
machinery has in fact broken down, and not to promote
any partisan interest;

3. The BJP recognises that regional imbalances have developed
in some states because of their size. The party would
appoint a commission to report on formation of smaller
states which are economically and democratically viable.
Initially BJP will have Uttranchal, Vananchal and Union
Territory of Delhi as three new states of the Indian Union;

4. Certain regions in some States have an acute sense of
neglect. These regions e.g. Ladakh and Jammu in J & K
State, and Marathwada and Vidarbha in Maharashtra -—
will be given Regional Development Councils;

5. The States will be given a fairer share of Central revenues;

6. We will appoint an Inter-state Council under Article 263
to settle all inter-state and State-centre disputes;

7. We will delete the ‘temporary’ Article 370 from
the Constitution, which more than anything else,
psychologically separates J & K state from the rest of the
country;

8. Article 30 permits minorities to run their own schools. It
will be rationalised and suitably amended to ensure justice
& equality to all irrespective of religions;

9. We will guarantee to all minorities, whether religious or
linguistic, peace and security and full opportunities for

322 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

progress and development;

10. We will set up a commission to study and report
whether the Presidential system of Government will
give us a more stable Government than the present
Parliamentary system;

11. BJP will examine the feasibility of introducing list system;

12. We will appoint a Law Commission to study various Civil
Laws. ancient, medieval and modern, to evolve a Common
Civil Law for the whole country to give our citizens a
feeling of unity and brotherhood;

13. We will maintain a National Register of citizens; and

14. In place of the minorities commission which entertains
complaints of discrimination only from minority sections
we will have a Human Rights Commission to look into
complaints of injustice against any section of society.

Fair Elections

Free and fair elections are the life-breath of democracy. From
time to time there are reports of doctored electoral rolls, booth-
capturing, physical violence. Money power and muscle power have
assumed sinister proportions. To restore health to our electoral
system we will:

1. Arrange for public funding of elections;

2. Introduce identity cards with photographs for all voters;

3. Replace ballot boxes by electronic voting machines, to
prevent rigging and booth-capturing;

4. Give the right of vote by postal ballot to Indian citizens
living abroad;

5. Permit company donations to parties - until State funding
is introduced, to keep black money out of the political
process;

6. Strengthen the independence of the Election Commission
by making its expenditure a charge on the Consolidated
Fund of India - as is the case with the Comptroller and
Auditor General and the Supreme Court and various High
Courts;

7. Hold State Assembly and Lok Sabha Elections simultaneously
and regularly every five years, avoiding, as far as possible,

Untitled-10 322 11/7/2016 11:19:43 PM

Election Manifestoes * 323

any mid-term polls;

8. Give legal teeth to the Election Commission’s Code of
Conduct by making violation of the same a corrupt practice
under the Election Law;

9. Empower the Election Commission to monitor Akashvani
and Doordarshan broadcasts and ensure that the same are
not misused for any partisan purposes;

10. Fix a realistic limit on a candidate’s election expenses and
then include in it not only the money spent by him but
also by his party and friends; and

11. Introduce public auditing of party funds.

Shri Ram Mandir at Janamsthan

BJP firmly believes that construction of Shri Ram Mandir at
Jamnasthan is a symbol of the vindication of our cultural heritage
and national self respect. For BJP it is purely a national issue and
it will not allow any vested interests to give it a sectarian and
communal colour. Hence the party is committed to build Shri Ram
Mandir at Janmasthan by relocating super imposed Babri structure
with due respect.

Clean Public Life
BJP attaches the greatest importance to the probity and quality
of public life. To this end we will
1. Inquire into all cases of serious corruption in high places;
2. Require all those holding public office to make an annual
declaration of their own and their dependents’ assets; and
3. Set an example in simple living, to give a new, higher tone
to public life.

North-east

We have long had many problems in the North-East beginning
with Naga insurgency. And now we have a Bodo problem and also
the ULFA problem in Assam proper. BJP will examine outstanding
regional and sectional problems, redress all legitimate grievances
and, for the rest maintain law and order with a firm hand. To this
end we will

1. Have electrified barbed wiring all along the Indo-

Bangladesh border, to keep infiltrators out;

Untitled-10 323 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM

324 * Party Document Vol-1

2. Check and identify infiltrators, strike out their names
from the electoral rolls and arrange to send them back to
Bangladesh;

3. Declare all property deals between locals and infiltrators
as null and void;

4. Give all adult citizens in the North-East identity cards
with photographs, on a priority basis;

5. To monitor and keep watch on receipt of foreign funds so
that it is not used for conversion in the garb of religious
activities;

6. Abolish the Inner Line Permit System in all the seven
North Eastern States;

7. Safeguard the interests of bonafide refugees fleeing because
of religious or political persecution in Bangladesh;

8. Secure the honourable return of Chakmas to Chittagong
Hills, Bangladesh;

9. Plan and organise an integrated and accelerated economic
development of the North-East; and

10. Incorporate Manipuri and Nepali in the Eighth Schedule
of the Constitution.

Punjab
The BJP holds Cong. (I) wholly responsible for the Punjab
problem. Had the Congress Govt. not toppled the duly elected
Govermnents, of Prakash Singh Badal, not once, not twice, but three
times, there would have been no Bhindaranwale, no ‘Blue Star’, no
‘Black Thunder’. Later, it was the loot and murder of thousands of
innocent Sikhs in Delhi and else-where in 1984 that has angered
the Sikhs, given a handle to Pakistan and encouraged terrorism.
However, the fact that not all the machinations of Pakistan and not
all the provocations of their terrorist agents, has soured Hindu-Sikh
relations, is proof positive that the heart of the Punjab is sound.
To mend matters in the Punjab, we will
1. Create a kilometer-deep Security Belt all along the Indo-
Pak border - as has already been done by Pakistan on its
own side - to prevent all movement of terrorists, smugglers
and their lethal cargo;
2. Post Army Units in the acutely disturbed border areas to
maintain order and restore confidence;

Untitled-10 324 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM

Election Manifestoes * 325

3. Give relief and provide rehabilitation to the widows and
orphans of 1984 outrages;

4. Punish the guilty men of the 1984 terror; and

5. Have the various grievances of the people of Punjab
examined in depth by experts, including social scientists
and redress them suitably.

Jammu, Kashmir And Ladakh
The BJP views with concern the recent developments in the
Kashmir valley. Widespread violence in the State has led to an
anarchical situation. This has paralysed tourism, the backbone of
the Kashmir economy.
The Pakistan - inspired violence against Hindus has caused
those Kashmiris to become refugees in their own land. The BJP will
1. Weed out Pakistani elements from the valley;
2. Hold free and fair elections in the State as soon as conditions
stabilise there;
3. Have separate Regional Development Councils for Jammu
and Ladakh;
4. Make relief and rehabilitation facilities available to Kashmiri
refugees, settling them particularly in the hills of Pir Panjal
Range; and
5. End all uncertainty about the future status of the State by
deleting Article 370 of the Constitution.

Telangana

Ever since the Razakar excesses in 1947-48 and the Communist
rebellion in 1948-50, the Telangana area of Andhra Pradesh has been
more or less disturbed. In the last few years, People’s War Group,
a Naxalite outfit, has been virtually running a state within a state
there. The Congress (I) and T.D.P. have been competing for the
support of P.W.G., which has been holding people to ransom and
killing scores of BJP men, and anybody else who would stand up
to them. BJP will go to the root of the Telangana land problem and,
for the rest, crush the lawless elements and restore law and order.

Untitled-10 325 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM

326 * Party Document Vol-1

ULFA

Under Congress (I) mismanagement, even a peaceful State
like Assam has produced a terrorist outfit like ULFA.

Here again, BJP will redress legitimate grievances and for the
rest, discipline unruly elements and restore order.

Law and Order

The BJP views with concern the alarming rise in social violence,
involving different castes and communities. All this violence is
mainly due to exciting feelings to carve out certain Vote Banks and
then cornering them. The party expects the District Administration
to take all steps necessary to maintain Law and Order. Should there
still be any serious eruption of violence, BJP will

1. Institute an inquiry;
Publish the findings of such an inquiry;
Punish the guilty;
Compensate the victims; and

Te WN

Transform the Police Machinery into an efficient and
dependable instrument of Law and Order.

Justice and Judicial Reform
In a situation of rapid social change, the judiciary holds a
pivotal place. It can ease social tensions by dispensing quick,
inexpensive and impartial justice. We are sorry to note that on
all these counts the Judiciary’s performance has been less than
exemplary, particularly since the Congress (I) came up with the
ploy of a committed judiciary, that is a Judiciary committed to the
ruling party. To stop further erosion of this hallowed institution,
and restore it to its earlier state, the BJP will
1. Take suitable measures to clear the arrears;
2. Through suitable measures BJP will ensure the cases, by
and large, are decided within one year;
3. Discourage interminable adjournment of cases for years
on end;
4. Improve the emoluments of judges to attract better talent;
5. Raise the retirement age of High Court Judges to 65 - that
of the lower judiciary to 60;
6. Give attractive pensions to judges;

Untitled-10 326 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM

Election Manifestoes * 327

7. Enhance judicial powers of Nyaya Panchayats to ensure
speedy justice and to carry to the doorstep of the people;

8. Provide mobile courts for the rural areas;

9. To provide free legal aid to SC and ST to enable them to
procure their rights and position as SC and ST; and

10. The role of executive in judicial appointment will be

rationalised to keep it within the framework of spirit of
the Constitution.

Panchayati Raj and People’s Power
The Panchayat system formed the bedrock of the democratic,
social and political set-up in India since Vedic times. It was this
democratic set-up that absorbed the shock of invasions and protected
the integrity of Indian life. In modern times Gandhiji commended
‘Power to the People’ in a ‘structure composed of innumerable
villages’ in which there will be ‘ever-widening, never-ending circles.
Life will not be a pyramid with apex sustained by the bottom but it
will be an oceanic circle whose centre will be the individual.’ Lok
Nayak Jaya Prakash Narayan also worked for Panchayati Raj and
Deendayalji pleaded for a statutory status for the village Panchayat
and the city municipality - in the Constitution. The BJP will
1. Effectively decentralise power;
2. Give a constitutional status to local bodies from Village
Panchayats to Metropolitan City Corporations; and
3. Involve the Panchayats in all rural development work
and make 10 per cent of the Development Budget directly
available to them.

Economic Growth with Social Justice

The Indian economy has reached a point of total collapse as a
result of the knock-out blows it has been dealt, by a succession of
profligate and irresponsible governments led by Congressmen and
ex-Congressmen. These people have literally robbed the country
and left its hapless citizens high and dry, staggering from one crisis
to another and trapped in a rising vortex of high prices, murderous
taxes and soaring debts.

The nation is on the verge of bankruptcy and has been reduced
to begging for hand-outs from all and sundry. Indian ambassadors go

Untitled-10 327 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM

328 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

abroad to beg for loans and even the Prime Minister has to genuflect
before heads of foreign nations. As a result India’s international
rating has sunk to a new low. India is one of the few countries in
the world without a proper government, without a proper budget
and without a proper economic policy.

The net result is an upside-down economy in which farmers
who produce cotton cannot afford to buy cloth; and masons who
put up five-star hotels, have no roofs over their heads. For certain
consumer durable there is no dearth of demand. It is estimated that
60 per cent of the consumer durables are purchased by less than 40
cent of the population. In other words, the Developmental effort
during the past four decades has resulted in a Socio-Economic
dualism.

All these trends have to be reversed, and the Bharatiya Janata
Party will reverse them. BJP government will ’ bring out White
paper on State of the Economy soon after assuming power.

The core sector of our economy will be MAN. State should
retreat from commercial activities and instead, concentrate on
basic functions such as maintaining law and order, justice, welfare
programme, infrastructure etc. We will make our Economy truly
Swadeshi by promoting native initiatives. It will be an Economy
of the People, by the People and for the People.

Through our pragmatic Economic strategy we promise to:

1. Hold the Price Line;

2. Liberate the Economy from the clutches of the bureaucratic

controls;

3. Not to hike Excise Duties on items of mass consumption for

five years and indeed, rationalise the whole tax structure;

4. Reduce non-plan expenditure drastically. Balance the

Revenue Budget (Zero budgetary deficit under Revenue
Account) and reduce the overall debt burden;

5. Ensure development of Rural Economy with remunerative

prices to the farmer and network of agro-based industries;

6. Make Public Sector productive and profitable, invite

equity participation in some of the public sector units with
adequate safeguards;
7. Use Science, Technology and native wisdom to raise annual

Untitled-10 328 11/7/2016 11:19:44 PM

Election Manifestoes * 329

growth rate of Economy from around 5 per cent at present
to 7.5 per cent;
8. Create a full fledged Ministry for Handicrafts and Village
Industries;
9. Implement Antyodaya scheme throughout the country;
and
10. Launch a nation-wide Employment Guarantee Scheme.

Agriculture: Integrated Rural Development
Agriculture is our First Priority. The Indian peasant is the
salt of the earth and he is the backbone of the country’s economy.
When he prospers, India prospers. We have waived the loam of
poor agriculturists in Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and
Rajasthan. But the Kisan will continue to flounder in poverty unless
the burden of the people depending on agriculture is reduced. A
countrywide network of agro-industrial complexes in rural areas
should relieve the burden and provide the real answer to the problem
of poverty of the peasantry. BJP aims at rural development where
farmer will not be forced to borrow.
The party has offered a new deal to the farmers in terms of
its Charter of Rights of Kisan. The party will
1. Ensure remunerative prices-to farmers;
2. Ensure minimum wages to the farm labour;
3. Ensure abundant supply of water and energy, the farmers
have a natural right to these basic inputs;
4. Remove all restrictions on the movement of farm produce
throughout the country;
5. Maintain parity of prices between agricultural and industrial
products;
6. Issue Pass Books to Kisans and Implement the land laws;
7. Allocate 60 per cent of the plan money, both central and
state, for rural development;
8. Encourage cultivation of pulses, oil-seeds, course grains,
fruits, vegetables and other cash crops;
9. Speedily complete on-going irrigation projects, organise
efficient flood management and relief;
10. Launch a million small, labour-intensive rural projects.
Cluster of agro-centers would be promoted which would

Untitled-10 329 11/7/2016 11:19:45 PM

330 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

take up activities directly relating to agriculture and also
meet other requirements of villagers. This would help to
generate employment to rural youths who are not actually
required in agricultural activities. e.g. Scientific storage
facilities, food processing units, cottage industries etc.
Investment in rural industries will be given appropriate
fiscal incentives;

11. Introduce cattle and crop insurance schemes and also
update the old Famine Code;

12. Improve roads and other means of communication
to facilitate quick transportation of agricultural and
horticultural produce to towns;

13. Provide market value compensation in case of land
acquisition in one installment, and provide jobs to those
uprooted in the process;

14. Protect the traditional rights of villagers in Gochar Bhoomi
and Nistar land;

15. Make Water, Power, a School and a Health Centre available
in all villages; and

16. Restructure the Agriculture Cost and Price Commission and
make it more broad-based, with adequate representation
to those engaged in farming.

Cow Protection and Cattle Wealth

The BJP recognises the fact that from times immemorial, cow-
protection has remained one of the basics of Indian culture and
Indian agriculture, and it is on the patient back of the cow and its
progeny that the entire structure of Indian agriculture rests. Over
seventy million animals are employed in farming operations in
Indian villages, more than eighty percent rural transport needs are
met by the bullock-cart. Cow and its progeny continue to be the
major source of power, manure and fuel, including bio-gas. Cow
is also an effective protection against environmental degradation.

The BJP regretfully observes that about three million cows are
slaughtered every year, most of them for export. The party would
put a total ban on the slaughter of cows. It will

1. Amend article 48 of Constitution to cover bulls and bullocks,

Untitled-10 330 11/7/2016 11:19:45 PM

Election Manifestoes * 331

and prohibit all trading (state as well as private) in the
slaughter of cows;

2. Implement a policy of Go-Samvardhan or development
of cow and cattle-breeding, including the improvement of
sheep and goat breeds, to bring about a White Revolution
in the country; and

3. Provide tax exemption to the income of Goshalas and
Pinjarapoles.

Industrial Policy

Industry in India has to be much more productive and
innovative to be able to fulfill its main role viz provide employment
in increasing numbers and inputs to other sectors, including
agriculture. It has also to earn foreign exchange competition with
the rest of the world and create resources for overall growth. The
BJP promises healthy investment environment so that entrepreneurs
find domestic market more attractive and challenging.

The following four main principles will characterise the
industrial policy of the BJP—

A. Self-reliance:

The party regards self-reliance as an over-riding component
in our external economic relations, including the import of capital
and technology. We will keep multinationals out of consumer
industries.

B. Modernisation:

BJP believes in a modern and progressive India. Open to new
ideas, no matter where they come from provided they suit our
requirements and ethos. We will not allow technology to degrade
man. Our people with their intelligence, industry and character
are the true and abiding wealth of India.

C. Decentralisation:

There is far too much power concentrated in the Government,
and it must be decentralised. The party stands for political as well
as economic democracy as also for an open society, where the
government has only an indicative and not a commanding role. It
will not be necessary for people to come to Delhi and waste time

Untitled-10 331 11/7/2016 11:19:45 PM

332 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

and money over licences and other clearances.

D. Daridra Narayan Sewa:

Consistent with the above three principles, the party will aim
at securing to every Indian citizen a minimum of material welfare
in terms of food, clothing, shelter, health and education.

The BJP pledges to:

1. Debureaucratise the industry, cut down the plethora of
controls which have mushroomed over the years, and which
breed corruption and dampen enterprise. We will clear
projects promptly and quickly. Industrial Development and
Regulations Act will be replaced by Industrial Development
Act;

2. Reconsider the role of the public sector in the light of its
contribution to development and society and draw up
firm guidelines for its re-organisation into a more efficient,
productive, profitable and people-oriented sector;

3. Improve the efficiency and profitability of crucial Public
Sector Units like Railways, oil and gas production, ports,
Nuclear Energy, Defence, etc. through better management;

4. Encourage people’s initiative in Public Sector Units
involving trading, hotels, tourism, consumer goods, etc.,
by offering them to the public in capital market with
appropriate safeguards;

5. Foster Swadeshi spirit in every economic and industrial
activity and reduce the country’s dependence on foreign
countries and foreign agencies. Foreign capital will be
encouraged in high-tech, import substitution and strictly
export oriented areas. Within the set guidelines clearance
will be given with minimum paperwork;

6. Promote agro-based industries;

7. Apply MRTP to business houses with assets value crossing
Rs. 1,000 crore and more; or with more than one-third of
the market share;

8. Encourage research and development as part of the process
of industrial growth and over-all modernisation;

9. Encourage businessmen to function as trustees of the

Untitled-10 332 11/7/2016 11:19:45 PM

Election Manifestoes * 333

public good;

10. Hazardous industries will be allowed to set up at safe
distance. Separate industrial satellites would be set up
exclusively for such units;

11. Protect our Economic Sovereignty and ensure that the
existing Patent laws, which safeguard Indian national
interest, remain intact under any external pressure;

12. Small-scale sector will be given due importance and
encouragement. We shall set up agencies to help small-
scale industry which will help in purchasing raw materials
and selling finished goods;

13. BJP government will evolve national management cadre.
Both public sector as well as private sector will draw their
requirements from this cadre; and

14. While conducive environment will be created to strengthen
capital market adequate measures will be taken to safe-
guard interests of small equity holders.

Handicrafts & Village Industries: To Play Pivotal Role

BJP firmly believes that national goals such as employment
generation, export earnings could be met through our ancient
craftmanship such as handloom & handicrafts, gems & jewelry
etc. For instance, investment of Rs. one crore in village industries
creates job opportunities for 202 persons while the same investment
in organised industrial sector can provide job to only 48 persons.
Besides, more than 40 per cent of our export earnings comes from
these so called smaller initiatives. BJP pledges to recognise their
importance in the national economy and look at them with enhanced
expectations.

1. A separate ministry will be set up to look after interests
of Handicrafts and village industries.

2. To preserve and promote native craftsmanship ‘National
Artisan Development Bank’ would be set up. Government
would contribute the necessary initial capital of this bank.

3. These native artisans will be made to feel proud of
themselves with due recognition in the society. Attempt
will be made to bring them together under cluster of

Untitled-10 333 11/7/2016 11:19:46 PM

334 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

artisans.

4. Native Artisans such a weavers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths,
carpenters, shoemakers, potters etc. Will be provided with
basic amenities such as housing.

5. Processing units, marketing facilities, marketing consultancy
etc. will be provided so that native artisans will get
remunerative returns for their special skill, which at present
is exploited by middlemen.

6. Similarly skill of tribal people will receive special attention.

7. In government media such as T.V., native products of
artisans will get adequate coverage without fees.

Fiscal Reform
The current economic mess is a direct consequence of the
mismanagement of the economy by the government. While the
government controls everyone and everything, nobody seems
to control the government. BJP believes that the government too
must function within the limits of strict financial discipline—on
the following lines
(i) The Government must live within its means. Revenue
Budgetary Deficits will be reduced to Zero and fiscal
deficits will be brought down from 9 per cent to 5 per
cent of Gross Domestic Product. BJP believes in imposing
a statutory ceiling on budget deficits in order to restrain
government spending;
(ii) At present the Reserve Bank has structural autonomy. BJP
Govt. will ensure operational autonomy of RBI:
1. BJP will adopt firm and bold measures to prevent
the generation of black money. It will also appoint a
Taxation Inquiry Commission to suggest guidelines
for taxation over a long-term period in line with future
developments;
2. Rationalise and simplify, the present tax structure,
and bring down the highest rate of income tax to 40
per cent. Raise the income Tax exemption limit to Rs.
48,000;
3. Weighted deductions will be provided taking the
number of dependents on the earning member;

Untitled-10 334 11/7/2016 11:19:46 PM

Election Manifestoes * 335

4. Exempt all investments in approved organisations,
private or public from the levy of Wealth tax;
5. Exempt employment-oriented industries in non-
municipal areas from income tax;
6. Abolish octroi duty and persuade state governments
to make good the loss of municipalities;
7. Arrange uniform sales tax rates throughout the country.
Loss in revenue will be compensated by the Centre;
8. Impose Estate Duty on property and assets worth
more than Rs. One Crore;
9. Share Corporation Tax with the states;
10. Give special tax concessions to writers, artists, and
others engaged in intellectual and cultural pursuits;
11. Non-developmental expenditure will be curtailed
drastically; and
12. Take stringent measures against smugglers and other
economic offenders. Make smuggling a non-bailable
offence and appoint special courts to try such cases.

Price Stability and Consumer Protection

It is our firm belief that price level could be controlled only
through minimisation of production and minimisation of cost of
production through technology upgradation.

Besides, by abolishing deficits on Revenue account and
cutting capital account deficits to half, the BJP will end inflation
and stabilise prices. Additionally

1. Public distribution system would be streamlined so that

needy sections of the society would have access to essential
commodities at nominal prices. Under the present system,
poorest section is forced to buy essential items from open
market. Poor daily wage earners who have to make their
purchases at the end of the day cannot afford purchases
once in a fortnight or so. Public distribution system will
be overhauled to help these sections;

2. Make not only grains, sugar and kerosene, but also pulses,

cooking oil and soap available in these shops;

3. Enforce the Consumer Protection Act of 1986, specially

by constituting Consumers’ Courts in all districts; and

Untitled-10 335 11/7/2016 11:19:46 PM

336 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

4. Build a powerful consumer movement and formulate
a price and profit policy for industrially manufactured
goods.

Employment Policy
The BJP recognises the citizen’s Right to Work in principle.
We shall make every endeavour to accomplish its objectives. Our
many developmental policies that will nearly double the Growth
Rate, will take good care of unemployment —
1. Launch Employment Guarantee Scheme throughout the
country in a phased manner;
2. Introduce a contributory Family Pension Scheme to cover
particularly the daily wage earner; and
3. Implement Antyodaya Scheme to serve the poorest in the
land.

Labour

BJP believes in healthy trade unionism. It will

1. Rationalise and simplify Labour Laws;

2. Recognise unions on the basis of secret ballot;

3. Introduce worker participation from the Shop Floor to the
Board Room in all public sector projects, public limited
companies and foreign companies operating in India;

4. Protect workers against inflation; and

5. Make laws, and evolve an effective mechanism, to protect
labour from occupational health hazards arising from
industries like asbestos, cement, slate, mica chemicals,
textiles, etc.

Government Employees
BJP will set up a permanent Employees Welfare Board witha
view to resolving the long-standing problems related to—
1. Time Scale Promotion;
Implementation of Awards;
Recruitment avenues;
Housing;
Revision of Pay Scales and award of bonus; and

AIF WN

Social welfare measures and travel concession for retired

Election Manifestoes * 337

personnel.

Energy Policy

There is acute energy crisis in India, particularly in villages
which have remained without any dependable source of energy
even after forty four years of Independence. This situation will
have to be tackled on a war footing. BJP will

1. Intensify efforts to find more oil, coal and natural gas
reserves, and economise on their use;

2. Improve the working of power plants which are now
functioning at less than 50 per cent of capacity; Stop the
massive theft of electric power;

4. Introduce power-efficient, energy-saving devices in homes
and factories;

5. Increase forest cover from the present 19 per cent of land
to the desired 33 per cent;

6. Encourage Private Sector’s participation in power
generation; and

7. Encourage alternative sources of energy such as wind,
water, biogas, solar power and ocean thermal energy
conversion.

Transport Policy

1. Speedy movement of goods and people will receive
utmost attention. In this regard, the whole country will
be considered as a single zone.

2. Metropolitan cities like Delhi will be provided with better
transport system;

3. Public Transport system will be improved so as to attract
marginal personal vehicle owners. This will help to reduce
demand for energy. Simultaneously, environmental
pollution could be controlled;

4. Utmost attention will be paid towards development of
Inter modal Transport System. This would mean integrated
development of all modes of transport such as roads and
road transport, railways, ports and shipping;

5. Inland water transport system will be fully tapped; and

6. Air transport system will be overhauled not only to

Untitled-10 337 11/7/2016 11:19:47 PM

338 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

improve operational efficiency but also to take care of
safety elements. Entrepreneurs will be encouraged to come
forward in air transport.

Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments

Under the current balance of payments crisis foreign trade plays
an important role. Export promotion and Import rationalisation
will receive due attention of BJP government —

1. Thrust would be given to promotion of exports and intensive
effort would be made to identify alternative markets and
also thrust commodities;

2. Required infrastructural support would be provided on
priority basis to export oriented units;

3. At the same time import would be rationalised and
restricted to those items which are absolutely essential;

4. Corporate sector would have to fulfill its export obligation
specially if its production is import intensive;

5. Balance of trade would have to be maintained on unit by
unit basis. Right now, performance of the corporate sector
is not satisfactory in this respect;

6. Under-invoicing of exports and over-invoicing of imports
will be strictly dealt with;

7. Excellence in export performance will receive special
recognition;

8. It is estimated that 12 million Indians settled in over 100
countries save around 100 billion U.S. dollars a year.
Scheme would be drawn to attract substantial portion of
these savings;

9. NRIs would be welcome to set up Industrial units. ‘Science
Based Industrial Parks’ would be set up which would
cater of the NRIs not only with regard to infrastructural
facilities required for their industrial units but would
also be complete with basic amenities such as education,
housing, health care and entertainment. This would help
us to raise resources as well as reversing the brain-drain;

10. The present principle of linking Indian rupee to basket of
currencies will be re-examined; and
11. Tourism will get special attention.

Science And Technology

The BJP believes that Science and Technology (S & T) should
be allowed to play its due role to transform India into a prosperous,
modern and enlightened society. The party would unhesitatingly
apply appropriate scientific and technological methods for increasing
productivity, eradicating poverty, hunger and disease and to provide
meaningful employment along with the basic amenities of life to
the vast percentage of population living below the poverty line.
The party holds that science is not merely harnessing nature for
material wealth but is as well liberating and enriching mind and
enlarging the human spirit. The BJP would use science in the service
of the poor and would develop technology with a human face —

1. Foster a scientific temper among the people;

2. Use Science and Technology for increasing productivity
and generating employment;

3. Implement a vigorous programme of science education
and research for improving quality of life;

4. Establish a network of Centres for Application of Science
and Technology to rural areas, implement lab to land
programmes and develop a strong low cost agro-industrial
base;

5. Put new life in National Laboratories. develop them as
centres of excellence in applied research;

6. Direct these laboratories to evolve Appropriate Technology
for Indian needs;

7. Accelerate the production of scientific literature in regional
languages and evolve a national terminology for science
and technology; and

8. Create the right working conditions, for our best brains
to remain here and serve the country and not migrate to
other lands.

A systematised effort would be made to bring national
laboratories and industry together by setting up of ‘Technology
Parks’ which would be maintained by the industry. They would
help to bridge the gap between talents and commercial needs and
promote co-operation between industry’s resources and expertise
in labs.

Towards a Vibrant Social Order

The Bharatiya Janata Party looks upon the people of India as
true wealth and strength of the country.

Since the majority of people of India live in the cluster of
villages, BJP will give special attention to their welfare and progress.
To this end we will

1. Carry water and electricity to every village;
2. Connect all villages to national centres of activities by
road transport;

local water resources; and

a time bound programme;

Laws to secure the proprietary rights of servicemen;

4. Include ex-servicemen’s welfare in the concurrent list;

5. Strengthen District Sainik Boards; and

6. Start more Sainik schools.

Sindhis

Sindhis are the only community in India to have lost their
entire territory as a result of Partition. The Party assures the Sindhi
Community of protection and promotion of their identity, culture,
language and literature and fulfillment of constitutional guarantees
enshrined in Article 350A and 350B of the Constitution of India.

Women

BJP looks upon womankind as Matri-Shakti. It will take several

steps to improve their socio-economic status. We will

1. Give preference to women as primary school teachers;

2. Make women equal share-holders in the husband’s wealth
and income;

3. Strengthen family courts, presided over by Women-judges
to try all family-related cases;

the fly-wheel of national progress. Apart from organising their
education and full employment, BJP will

Untitled-10 341 11/7/2016 11:19:48 PM

342 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

1. Utilise their energies to transform society;

N

Associate them in all developmental activities;

3. Mobilise them to fight social evils like child marriage,
dowry, untouchability, drug-addiction;

4. Build more Youth hostels; and

5. Inculcate in them a sense of pride in our traditions and

heritage and confidence in our future.

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
The BJP sincerely believes with all its heart in the upliftment
of SC and ST. To this end we will

1. Energetically enforce anti-untouchability laws;

2. Make free legal aid available to SC in cases under these
laws;

3. Make all village wells available to all castes and
communities;

4. Set up a financial agency on the line of NABARD to cater

hill and forest tribal areas.

Other Backward Castes

The BJP is pledged to the socio-economic uplift of Other
Backward Castes particularly the more backward among them.
BJP in its 1985 resolution and subsequently in its 1989 Election
Manifesto commended the following reservation policy:

1. Reservation should be continued for the Scheduled Castes

and Scheduled Tribes as before;
2. Reservation should also be made for other backward classes

Untitled-10 342 11/7/2016 11:19:48 PM

Election Manifestoes * 343

broadly on the basis of the Mandal Commission Report,
with preference to be given to the poor among these very
classes; and

3. As poverty is an important contributory factor for

backwardness, reservation should also be provided for
members of the other castes on the basis of their economic
condition.

In view of the shocking manner in which the National Front
government implemented the Mandal Commission Report which
resulted in self-immolation of youths and pitted caste against
caste and community against community. BJP feels that the
reservation policy should be introduced taking into consideration
socio-economic ethos. Reservation policy should be used as an
instrument of social justice and promoting social harmony as well.
The question of reservation has to be viewed with open mind free
from all prejudices of any kind.

In addition BJP

1. Will start a chain of first class residential schools where
the really bright children of really poor families of all
castes and communities will be admitted, educated and
otherwise looked after, to come into their own and enter
Services, Business and Professions in open competition;

2. Most of the non-agricultural OBCs are artisans. Foreign
and metropolitan competition has hurt these people badly.
BJP will train and equip them, so that they can find a place
of honour in the new social economy.

The Destitute and Handicapped

BJP will not forget the destitute and the handicapped. It will
not allow anybody to starve. Antyodaya Scheme will take care of
destitutes. We will encourage people to set up institutions for the
care of the physically handicapped and mentally retarded and
make certain jobs available for them.

Population Policy

The Bharatiya Janata Party believes in a stable growth of
the Population — and the quality, physcial and mental, of that

Untitled-10 343 11/7/2016 11:19:48 PM

344 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

Population. We will, therefore —

1. Adopta National Population Policy, if necessary through
legislative measures;

2. Make Family Planning information and facilities available
to the people. Involve all voluntary, social and cultural
organisations in creating an awareness for adopting family
planning as a way of life;

3. Integrate the family planning programme with other
community welfare programmes; and

4. Pursue vigorously the voluntary adaptation of the
‘two children’ norm through adequate incentives and
disincentives for achieving the long term demographic
goals.

Environment

The Bharatiya Janata Party takes serious note of the degradation
of the environment and disturbance of the eco-system. The pollution
of air, water and soil are a serious menace to health. The denudation
of forests, the warming up of the earth, acid rain and the ‘hole in
the sky’ are a threat to the whole life-system itself. We in India
have always looked upon the earth as Divine Mother.

Our land, air and waters, our hills, forests, flora and fauna, are

all sacred to us. We will keep them neat, clean and intact. We will

1. Formulate a National Resources Management Policy and
adopt a holistic approach in planning;

2. Require anti-pollution devices to be installed to process
and clean up industrial and Municipal effluents before
the same are discharged into our rivers;

3. Keep a strict watch on chemical fertilizers and insecticides

for any poisoning of the soil, and ban DDT etc;

Curb noise pollution especially in the cities;

Undertake a massive afforestation programme;

While protecting the traditional rights of Vanavas is, we
will require the planting of three trees for every single
tree that is cut by anybody for any reason;

8. Make environmental concerns an integral part of education;

9. Take special care in the import of technology, and promote

research, for developing indigenous pollution-free
technology.

and an aura all our own. We will
1. Conserve the ancient heritage of India and make people
feel proud of it;

achievements of ancient Indian genius in the fields of art,
science, technology, medicine, agriculture, etc;

violence and vulgarity out of films.

Tourism
The BJP recognises the importance of tourism as an instrument
of national integration, international understanding and employment
generation. India abounds in natural beauty and charming tourist
spots, which have fascinated people from far and wide. We will
1. Promote tourism, both national and international, as an
industry;
2. Evolve a policy of integrating tourism and marketing of
handicrafts and other art works;
3. Take up a scheme of training tourist guides and opening
tourist information centres; and
4. Build Holiday Homes in the hills, on sea beaches and at
pilgrim centres.

Mass Media

The BJP re-affirms its commitment to the freedom of thought

and expression. We will

and not just an implied one, derived from the citizen’s
right to Freedom of Speech;

duty on newsprint and the tax on newspaper advertising;

The Quality of Life

every family to own a house. To this end it will

1. Make land available to cooperative group housing societies;

»

Education
The party view with concern that with the rising cost
of education, the existing socio-economic disparities will be
perpetuated in the field of education. The BJP believes in equalisation
of educational opportunities and build up a system worthy of the
genius of our heritage and the undoubted capacities of our youth.
Towards this end, we will
1. Implement Article 45 of the Constitution to give free
education to all children in the 6-14 age group to enforce
the principle of universal primary education;

Medical system;
2. Retrieve, compile and publish ancient wisdom about
health, herbs and other remedies;

under-nourishment of our own people;

Towards World Fraternity

In four decades of Freedom, India has had to face as many as
four aggressions against our territory. This is, in all conscience, a
high degree of challenge to our territorial integrity and national
sovereignty, with its consequential strains on the Indian Economy,
the Indian Polity and the Indian society.

Diplomacy

Like India, the world is also at cross roads. With the sudden
disappearance of bipolar divide of 45 years, the USSR and the US
are no longer adversaries but partners. Curtain has finally been
drawn over the cold war that has dominated the world for most
of the current century.

International equations are changing fast. In the post cold
war period, neither the USA needs the third world countries to
contain communism nor does the USSR has any use now for its
‘natural allies’ in the developing world. As a result. non-alignment
movement which was created against the backdrop of a bipolar
world, has lost its relevance.

The new situation is a challenging one and at the same time
pregnant with several fresh opportunities to enlarge India’s role in
global affairs. But only economically healthy, militarily strong and
progressive India can carve out a niche for itself. As long as India
goes around with a begging bowl around the world, her voice in
the international affairs will not be heard with respect.

Prevention is always better than cure. That Defence is best
that does not need to be invoked too often to defend our legitimate
national interests. And that, in turn calls for wise and integrated
Domestic,, Economic and Foreign Polices. In the past, our foreign

Untitled-10 350 11/7/2016 11:19:49 PM

Election Manifestoes * 351

policy has suffered from inconsistencies. At times we have treated it
as an exercise in verbal gymnastics and used it as a feather in a Prime
Minister’s cap. At other times we have treated it - as was the case
only recently with the Gulf War — as a football, for irresponsible
parties to kick it around. We are sorry to note that Foreign Policy
discussion and formulation has not been institutionalised in India.
As a result the performance of our diplomacy has been spotty at best.

Pakistan and China continue to occupy territories lawfully
ours. Thousands of Tibetans continue to live in India as refugees.
The Pakistan Establishment is hostile, and even the Bangladesh
Establishment has been less than friendly. The situation in
Afghanistan has fortunately stabilised. But the situation in Sri
Lanka is as disturbed as ever, with serious violence erupting on
both sides of the Palk straits. Burmans next door continue to suffer
dictatorship. And Indians abroad continue to suffer discrimination
in many lands.

The BJP is wedded to National interest and World Peace. To

these ends we will

1. Set up a Policy Planning Committee of experts to formulate
a long-term Foreign Policy for India;

2. Forge a national Consensus on Foreign Policy issues;

3. Work for a stronger SAARC in view of the old bipolar
world giving place to a uni-polar World;

4. Invite Pakistan to come forward to resolve out disputes
in terms of the Shimla Pact and meanwhile develop
cooperative economic and media relations;

5. Promote the idea of aCommon Market of all SAARC states;

6. Constitute a South Asian Environmental Protection
Authority, with representation from non-governmental
environmentalists from all concerned countries;

7. Continue the North-South Dialogue and promote South-
South cooperation;

8. Develop friendly and cordial relations with the countries
of South-East Asia, with whom we have ancient bonds of
blood and culture;

9. Stand by persons of Indian origin abroad in defence of
their legitimate rights;

Untitled-10 351 11/7/2016 11:19:50 PM

352 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

10. Give Dual Citizenship to Indian citizens abroad; and

11. Strive to strengthen United Nations in view of the fact
in the changed situation the world powers are more
inclined to work-through the UN than unilaterally or even
through older groups and factions. Strive to make India an
autonomous power centre in the world with a permanent
seat in the U.N. Security Council.

Defence
Diplomacy and Defence are two sides of the same coin, that is

a country’s relation with the outside world. A sound Foreign Policy

will give us a secure base for a sound Defence policy. However,

recent events have shown that international relations continue
to be governed by the law of the jungle. The way Iraq occupied

Kuwait and USA exceeded the UN resolutions to bring death and

destruction to both Kuwait and Iraq is a warning that we cannot

afford to neglect our Defence. The BJP will
1. Encourage an educated debate on national strategy as a
route to national security strategy;
2. Set up a National Security Council to institutionalize
forward planning;

Give our Defence Forces Nuclear Teeth;

4. Give ourselves a Blue Water Navy that will be the first
Navy in the Indian Ocean from Singapore to Aden;

5. Encourage Research and further Development on
Arjun Battle Tank, Light Combat Aircraft, Army Radio
Engineering Network (AREN) and Prithvi and other
missiles developed by Dr. Abdul Kalam;

6. Identify and eliminate foreign lobbies engaged in arms
trade;

7. Effect economic even while improving Defence capability;

8. Avoid unnecessary duplication and merge paramilitary
forces like BSF, Assam Rifles, Indo-Tibetan Border Police
with the Army and the Coast Guard with the Navy; and

9. Liberalise the Official Secret Act to facilitate an intelligent
debate on defence.

Invite

This then is the programme which the BJP pledges to implement
under a team of inspiring and brilliant leaders and dedicated
cadres of the party of impeccable record of clean public life and
selfless service to the nation. The party is committed to usher ina
new political culture.

India today is in the grip of a serious multi-dimensional crisis
of unprecedented proportions. The national mood is not just of
cynicism but of mounting disgust and rage, not unmixed with
sorrow at the steady deterioration in public morality at the topmost
leadership level. The people feel sad that through an accident of
history this great country should have been saddled with a coterie
of small men who are not only incompetent and corrupt, but who
lack a sense of commitment to the nation, its democratic institutions
and cultural traditions.

In the opinion of the BJP a critical moment of history has
arrived for India. The country cannot afford to miss this moment of
history, this opportunity to throw out the rulers mainly responsible
for this country’s ruination.

The BJP on its part has left no stone unturned in its efforts
to put up a determined and united electoral battle and has
unhesitatingly sacrificed its party interests whenever national
interests so demanded. The Bharatiya Janata Party calls upon the
people to join in its struggle for ushering in a new era of hope and
prosperity, a value based polity and throw out this corrupt and
incompetent Congress.

Introduction

The Bharatiya Janata Party is wedded to the Unity and Integrity
of India. It stands for Law and Order - for Justice, Social and
Economic and for Security, Internal and External. It is committed
to the uplift of the poor and the downtrodden. But BJP is sorry to
note that the Rajiv Government has disappointed the country on
all these counts.

India today is in the grip of a serious multidimensional crisis
of unprecedented proportions. The national mood is not just of
cynicism but of mounting disgust and rage, not unmixed with
sorrow, at the steady deterioration in public morality at the topmost
leadership level. The people feel sad that through an accident of
history this great country should have been saddled with a coterie
of small men who are not only incompetent and corrupt, but who
lack a sense of commitment to the nation, its democratic institutions
and cultural traditions.

Evidence ‘is mounting that the Prime Minister, whose personal
probity is now in serious doubt, has not only been bending words
but telling lies, distorting facts, changing versions, elbowing — — —
ministers of integrity and unabashedly misleading the Parliament
and the Nation even on crucial issues of national defence and
security. The men at the top are not only without integrity but also
without shame. In any other country, such a government would
have resigned long ago. But it is continuing in office and trying
to subvert the democratic process by resorting to fascist methods,
including mugging of the press, instigation of communal riots and
subversion of the judiciary.

Stark failure faces the country on all fronts. Accords have ended

Untitled-10 357 11/7/2016 11:19:50 PM

358 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

up in bloody discords. The Rajiv regime is bathed in blood and
muck from head to foot, from Punjab to, Assam and from Kashmir
to Sri Lanka. Everything Rajiv Gandhi touches ends up ina bloody
mess. A man who waded to his office through the blood-soaked
streets of Delhi will be leaving behind a gory legacy. This country
is not safe in the hands of such a man or such a party. How can
men who lack integrity themselves, and are not above looting the
country, defend the country and protect its integrity and honour?

The power and prestige of great institutions like the Parliament,
the Army and the Judiciary have been eroded; the press has been
repeatedly threatened and harassed; and the electronic media have
been prostituted. The directive principles of state policy have been
forgotten; the Mandal Report on the welfare of backward classes
has been pigeonholed; and never before has Indian womanhood
suffered insult and assault as during the last five years.

By negativing the Supreme Court judgment in the Shahabano
case, the government has put a premium on communalism and
obscurantism. And by recognising Urdu as second official language
in Uttar Pradesh on election eve, it has shown more interest in
Muslim votes than in Urdu language. In the process it has only
given the country so many corpses. By not allowing the rebuilding
of the Ram Janma Mandir in Ayodhya, on the lines of Somnath
Mandir built by the Government of India in 1948, it has allowed
tensions to rise, and gravely strained social harmony.

About the situation on the economic front, the less said the
better. During the last five years, prices have doubled and in many
cases trebled; unemployment has soared by leaps and bounds and
national debt increased three times. And all this while the country
has been thrown open for plunder by foreign interests who are
taking out more from the country than they ever put in. The country
has paid out more to foreigners in the last five years than the entire
debt of farmers which the government refuses to write off.

In this enveloping darkness, the Bharatiya Janata Party stands
as a beacon of light. It is wedded to Desh and Dharma, Samata and
Samanvay. It stands for justice - social and economic - for all, for
the Kisan and the Jawan, for the young and the old, for the poor
and the downtrodden, for women and children, irrespective of
class, creed or gender. It also stands for law and order particularly

Untitled-10 358 11/7/2016 11:19:51 PM

Election Manifestoes * 359

moral order, for without such an order, the country cannot endure
and flourish.

BJP rejects both exploitative capitalism and suppressive
communism. Its approach to life and society, as expounded by our
late Pt. Deendayal Upadhyay, is integrative and holistic. It looks
upon the farmer in the field and the worker in the factory as two
mighty wheels of our modern Rashtra-rath. It believes that the nation
cannot progress until those who have remained at the bottom of
the social pile for centuries are helped to elevate themselves and
join the mainstream on a footing of equality.

BJP believes in positive secularism which, according to our
constitution-makers, meant Sarva-Dharma-Sama-Bhava and
which does not connote an irreligious state. It certainly does
not mean rejection of our history and cultural heritage, the very
foundations of this great nation. The BJP stands for ‘Justice for All
and Appeasement of None’.

This is what we are and this is what we aim to do. Come and
join us in the great enterprise of nation-building, in taking this
country to great heights of prosperity and glory. Following is the
programme which the BJP offers to the people for taking India to
its destiny-a modern, peaceful and prosperous nation on the road
to an exciting future.

National Unity and National Integration

India is one country, and all Indians irrespective of caste, creed or
language are one people, one nation.

The idea of a theocratic state is an anathema to Indian mind
and the BJP believes that State in India has always been a civil
institution which respects all religions equally and makes no
discrimination between one citizen and the other on the grounds
of language, gender, caste or religion.

It is the duty of the State to guarantee justice and security to
all minorities - linguistic, religious or ethnic. The BJP considers
that it is also imperative for national integration that minorities
do not develop a minority complex.

Indian Constitution is quasi-federal. It envisages strong States
with a strong Centre. The BJP believes in maintaining a balance
between the two as visualised in our Constitution.

The BJP also recognises that regional imbalances have
developed in some States because of their size. The party stands
for the formation of smaller states which are economically and
administratively viable. The BJP will

1. Support and strengthen State Governments and not

destabilise and topple them;

2. Give the states a fairer share of Central revenues and

increase the financial powers of the states;

3. Constitute an Inter-State Council under Article 263 to settle

all Inter-State and State-Centre disputes;

4. Appoint State Governors in consultation with State

Governments;
5. Limit the number of ministers to 10 per cent of legislators;

and security, and full opportunities for progress and
development;

7. Delete the temporary Article 370 of the Constitution and
scrap the 59th Amendment of the Constitution:,

8. Appoint a Commission to examine the various personal
laws in vogue in the country - Hindu Law, Muslim Law,
Christian Law, Parsi Law, Civil Law etc. and to identify
the fair and equitable ingredients in these laws, prepare
a draft with a view to evolving a consensus for a uniform
Civil Code;

9. Appoint a Commission to examine the Constitution of
India for making it an effective instrument for containing
centrifugal tendencies;

10. Grant statehood to the Union Territory of Delhi, create
Separate States of Uttaranchal in U.P. and Vananchal in
Bihar, give the status of Union Territory to Laddakh; and

11. Maintain a National Register of Citizens.

Human Rights Commission

BJP will widen the scope of the present Minorities Commission
and convert it into a Human Rights Commission to take care of the
just rights of all individuals, groups and communities.

Fair Elections
Free and fair elections are sine qua non of a democratic polity.
The BJP believes that elections must be held regularly and very
fairly. The BJP will
Introduce compulsory voting for all citizens;
Arrange for public funding of elections;
Ban the company donations;
Introduce Identity Cards for voters;
Use electronic voting machines in all elections;
Give the right of Postal Ballot to Indian citizens living
abroad;
7. Strengthen the independence of the Election Commission
by making expenditure incurred on the Commission as a
charge on the Consolidated Fund of India, as is provided

DIP ONP

in the case of Comptroller and Auditor General and
Supreme Court and High Court judges, and by providing
the Commission with an independent infrastructure;

8. Hold State and Central elections simultaneously every
five years;

9. Examine the feasibility of introducing the List system to
elections;

10. Have party accounts publicly audited;

11. To prevent abuse of governmental power by the ruling
party give legal teeth to the Code of Conduct framed by
the Election Commission; violation of the Code shall be
made a corrupt practice under the Law;

12. Empower Election Commission to monitor all political and
election coverage by the Doordarshan and the Akashvani
and ensure that these media are not abused; and

13. Include in the limitative ceiling of election expenses all
expenditure incurred by the candidate, his election agent,
his party and supporters.

Clean Public Life

Cleansing of the public life will receive BJP’s top priority. The
party holds that the roots of all corruption lie in political corruption.
The party recognises the urgency of evolving effective mechanism
to break the unholy nexus between the corrupt bureaucrat, corrupt
businessmen and the corrupt politician. The BJP is determined
to fight corruption at all levels and will specifically adopt the
following measures —

1. It will enquire into all cases of corruption in the foreign
deals (including the defence deals) by various ministries
and departments of the Government and punish the
guilty.

2. It will enact a law, and create institutions of Lokpal and
Lokayukta bringing the P.M. and the Chief Minister also
under its purview.

3. Streamline procedures and rules relating to purchase,
awarding contracts etc. in government and public sector
undertakings, and also the discretionary powers of political
authorities.

assets.

6. Review and update the existing laws, administrative
procedures and powers for detecting the corrupt practices
and for speedily punishing the guilty.

7. Create an atmosphere of austerity and simplicity by
enforcing strictly the norms of expenditure in government
departments.

The North East

The entire North Eastern region is in ferment. The BJP holds,
the Central Government squarely responsible for the neglect of the
North Eastern Region and its unsatisfactory economic development
and consequent exploitation by the foreign Missionaries.

The BJP would take following steps to meet the alarming
situation in the North East—

1. Setting up of the barbed wire fencing along the Indo-

Bangladesh border;

2. Detection of infiltrators and deletion of their names from
the voters list on a war footing. Steps will be taken for
their deportation;

Issue identity cards to all citizens in border states;

4. Creating a special cell for identification of the landed
properties acquired by infiltrators, such property will be
confiscated;

5. Repealing the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act.
Foreign - contributions will be totally banned. No private
organisation, religious, social or any other will be allowed
to receive any foreign contributions-in cash or kind;

6. Abolishing the Innerline permit system in all the North
Eastern States;

7. Safeguarding the interests of refugees;

8. Taking effective steps for an honourable return of the

10. Implementing a sub-plan for the economic development
of the Tribals.

Punjab

The BJP holds the Congress (I) squarely responsible for what is
happening in Punjab. Punjab situation continues to deteriorate not
because of any lack of power with the government. The government
is possessing enormous powers but lacks a policy and a will to act.

The BJP has always been striving for maintaining social
harmony in Punjab. Several party leaders including the State BJP
President and other colleagues have laid down their lives in this
cause.

The BJP would strive for a fair and peaceful solution of
the Punjab problem. It would adopt the following approach for
containing terrorism in Punjab—

1. Creation of a security belt all along the Western borders

with Pakistan without delay;

2. Secure the assistance of Army to help the civil administration
in the Mand area, if need be;

3. Strengthen the intelligence apparatus;

4. Punishing those who were responsible for the killings of
innocents in Delhi and elsewhere after the assassination
of Mrs Gandhi;

5. Adequately compensating the victims of violence; and

6. Review the structural changes in the economy of Punjab
and to remove the distortions.

Jammu And Kashmir And The Western
The BJP views with concern the recent developments in the State
of Jammu and Kashmir and the continued discrimination against the
people of Jammu. The rabid communal and pro-Pakistan elements are
spearheading a massive hate India campaign in Kashmir valley and
the entire region is engulfed by widespread terrorism. The unabated
infiltration and smuggling all along the western border needs to be
effectively curbed. The BJP suggests that—
1. Effective and immediate measures to weed out the
foreigners from Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan and
Gujarat be taken;

Untitled-10 364 11/7/2016 11:19:52 PM

Election Manifestoes * 365

2. Border with Pakistan should be effectively guarded by
creating a security belt to stop infiltration of trained
terrorists and smuggling of arms and ammunition, narcotics
and other contraband commodities; and

3. A Regional Council for Jammu be formed so that regional
12 imbalances in development be removed.

Law and Order and Protection of Weaker Sections
The BJP views with alarm the rise of social violence in the
country. This includes communal violence, atrocities on Scheduled
Castes and Tribals, and criminal assaults on women. The BJP
believes that the weaker sections need an effective protection from
atrocities and the Party is committed to the security of life, limb,
property and honour of all citizens. In case of a serious eruption
of violence, the BJP commends that —
1. A judicial inquiry will always be held;
2. The inquiry report will be published;
3. Those guilty of incitement to violence or dereliction of
duty will be punished;
4. Allsufferers will be suitably compensated and rehabilitated;
5. An indepth socio-economic study of riot-prone areas to
take effective steps for riot-prevention will be conducted;
6. The Police Force be transformed into an efficient
and impartial instrument of law and order, through
modernisation programme and better service conditions;
and
7. Political meddling in police work be stopped and a
machinery for redressal of Police/ People’s griveances be
created.

Justice and Judicial Reforms
The BJP believes that without an independent judiciary, it
is impossible to have the Rule of Law. Also the judicial system
should be speedy, inexpensive and just. The BJP would under-take
the following measures to restore the independence, integrity and
efficiency of the judicial system —
1. Take effective measures to provide free legal aid to the
poor and specially the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and

Untitled-10 365 11/7/2016 11:19:52 PM

366 * Party Document Vol-1

gradual abolition of the Court-fees;

2. Simplify the legal procedures and increase the number of
judges so that majority of the cases are disposed of within
one year;

3. Provide mobile courts for the rural areas and set up Nyaya
Panchayats with judicial powers;

4. Offer better service conditions and emoluments to judges
at all levels;

5. The Chief Justice of India should have the final say in the
appointment of the High Court and Supreme Court Judges
to be recommended by an independent body;

6. Raise the retirement age of judges to 65, give them full
pension equal to their salary, prohibit them from holding
any office after retirement;

7. Appoint a Commission for suggesting an overhaul of the
Judicial System which is under serious stress;

8. Appoint special courts for different categories of cases so
that pending cases in various High Courts and Supreme
Court are cleared within one year; and

9. Introduce social security measures like provident fund
and group insurance schemes for the advocates.

Decentralisation of Power and Panchayati Raj

The Panchayat System formed the bedrock of the democratic
functioning of the Indian Social System since the Vedic period.
Mahatma Gandhi and Jay Prakash Narayan were strong votaries of
local self-government. The Jana Sangh under the leadership of Pt.
Deendayal Upadhyay had always canvassed for the Constitutional
status of the Panchayats and Municipal boards.

The BJP believes in decentralisation of power and strengthening
of democracy at the grass roots.

The party ensures a Constitutional status to the Panchayats
and other local self institution and assured share of resources so
that they do not depend upon discretionary grants.

The BJP will neither impose Panchayats from above nor will
use them to bypass the State Governments. Oo

National Economy

The Indian economy is presently going through an acute crisis.
In fact it has been stagnating for the last ten years and more so
since 1985. The per capita availability of the items of staple diet
of the nation, in these years has gone down. The nation is more
undernourished today than it was a few years ago. As a result of
wrong plan priorities, the country is producing more colour TV
sets, but not enough steel, more computers but not enough power,
more fancy cars but not enough buses, more superfine fabrics but
not enough cheaper varieties of dhoties and saries. The result of this
lopsided elitist sense of priorities, combined with corruption and
profligacy, is that today there are more people looking for jobs than
ever before, more landless farmers than ever before, more illiterates
than ever before. The consumer is groaning under the burden of
back-breaking prices. There is more sorrow than happiness, more
poverty than wealth.

The BJP hold the ruling party squarely responsible for
deliberately neglecting the agriculture sector in pursuit of mythical
modernisation.

Forty years ago, the disparity between the farmer and his
counterpart in other sectors was not very large. Today it is one to
three; soon, it will be one to four. A country that treats its farmers
with contempt is bound to remain mired in poverty, as India is.
The Country is again resorting to imports of foodgrains after so
many years, which in itself is a tell-tale commentary on the mess
that has been made on the farm front, in fact, in respect of the
entire economy. Thanks to the wrong policies of our rulers over
the years, thousands of crores of rupees from the rural poor have
been transferred to the urban rich, resulting in a colossal rural

Untitled-10 367 11/7/2016 11:19:53 PM

368 * Party Document Vol-1

indebtedness. The BJP will reverse all these ugly trends and give
the country a humane economy. It will take all steps necessary to
achieve full employment, maximise production, stabilise prices
and eradicate poverty and rural indebtedness. For this BJP offers
the following programme:

Agriculture

In the opinion of the BJP the speedy development of the
agriculture and rural sector is the key to India’s prosperity. The
party recognises that more than 65 per cent of Indian farmers are
poor, they need capital and subsidised inputs for their rapid growth.
The Kisan will continue to flounder in poverty unless the burden
of people depending upon agriculture is reduced. A network of
agro-industrial complexes in the rural areas is the real answer
to the problems of poverty of the Indian peasantry. The party is
committed to implement its Charter of Rights of Kisan.

The BJP offers a new deal to the farmers and it will—

1. Write off the debts of the farmers, agricultural labourers
and rural artisans;

2. Allocate sixty percent of the plan money, both Central
and State, for rural development, agricultural and allied
services;

3. Ensure remunerative prices to the farmers, computed after
taking into consideration all the parameters like cost of
inputs and living index etc;

4, Ensure minimum wages to farm labour;

5. Maintain parity of prices between agricultural and industrial
produce;

6. Remove all restrictions on the movement of agricultural
produce throughout the country;

7. Arrange abundant and regular supply of water and energy;

8. Introduce crop and cattle insurance schemes which would
guarantee adequate compensation in case of crop failure,
damage or loss due to natural calamities or outbreak of
epidemics in cattle; also update the age old famine code;

9. Provide market value compensation in one instalment in
case of land acquisition and rehabilitation of the uprooted
in the process;

Untitled-10 368 11/7/2016 11:19:53 PM

Election Manifestoes * 369

10. Issue Pass Books to Kisans and implement the land laws;

11. Reclaim all wasteland and give special attention to dry
farming;

12. Speedily complete the on-going big irrigation projects,
take up thousands of small and minor irrigation projects,
organise efficient flood management and relief;

13. Encourage the cultivation of pulses, oil-seeds, fruits, nuts,
and other cash crops;

14. Protect the traditional rights on village forests and Nistar
Land;

15. Speedily provide the minimum civic facilities like drinking
water, roads and other means of communication, public
health and hygiene;

16. Organise the purchase operations through a wide and
efficient network so as to ensure that all farmers and
particularly the small farmers realise the guaranteed price
and are not forced to make a distress sale; and

17. Restructuring the Agriculture Cost and Price Commission
so that two-thirds of its members are drawn from those
engaged in farming.

Cow Protection and Animal Standard

The BJP notes with concern that in spite of the clear
provision of the Constitution in Article 48 and the Supreme
Court’s emphasis that cow protection is a constitutional mandate
and slaughter of cows is not enjoined in any religion including
Muslim religion, complete prohibition of cow slaughter has yet
not been introduced in various States of India, specially in West
Bengal and Kerala.

The BJP recognises the fact that from times immemorial Cow
protection has remained one of the basic tenets of Indian culture
and it is on the patient back of the cow and its progeny that the
entire structure of the Indian agriculture rests. Over seventy
million animals are employed in the farming operations in Indian
villages, more than eighty percent rural transport requirements
are met by the bullocks. Cow and its progeny continue to be the
major source of power, manure and fuel including bio-gas. Cow is
also an effective protection against environmental degradations.

Untitled-10 369 11/7/2016 11:19:53 PM

370 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

The BJP regretfully observes that about three million cows
are slaughtered every year and most of them for export. The party
would put a total ban on the slaughter of the cows. It will

1. Amend the Article 48 of the Constitution to include bulls,

and bullocks, and to prohibit State-trading in slaughter
of cows; to ensure that no-one has a fundamental right of
trade or business to slaughter cows; and to incorporate
the subject of Cow-protection in the concurrent list;

2. Implement a policy of Go-Samvardhan or development
of cow and cattle breeding including the improvement of
Sheep and Goat breeds to bring about a white revolution
in the country; and

3. Provide tax exemption to the income of Goshalas and
Pinjarapoles.

Industry

The BJP’s industrial policy flows from the following

principles —

1. Self-reliance: The Party’s industrial policy would be

strongly nationalistic in approach and content.
The party, would like to keep multinationals out of the
field of consumer industries. The party regards self-
reliance as an overriding component in our external
economic relations, including the import of technology
and capital.

2. Decentralisation: The party stands for political as well
as economic democracy, so that the benefits of economic
development go to the smallest man. The party believes
that for this decentralisation of economic power, presently
concentrated in the hands of the state or of big business,
is necessary. Primacy for agriculture and Agro-based
industries, Swadeshi and importance to the small and
medium scale sector in industry are commitments that
flow from this.

3. Modernisation: BJP will harness new technologies to the
changing requirements of the country, and build India
as a modern and progressive nation. But it will not allow
technology to degrade man as just another input in Gross

Untitled-10 370 11/7/2016 11:19:54 PM

Election Manifestoes * 371

National Product. Man will be the main focus of our
developmental policies.

4. Daridra Narayan Sewa: Consistent with the above three
elements, the party will aim at securing to every Indian
citizen minimum conditions of material welfare in terms
of food, raiment, shelter, health and education.

The party will leave no stone unturned in carrying jobs
to the people. Generation of employment will be a major
component of BJP’s industrial policy.

BJP will encourage and improve industry all-round. We will—

1. Make the public sector productive and profitable; its
management will be professionalised and a Central service
called the ‘Indian Management Service’ will be formed
to select, train and allocate the professional managers to
these units;

2. Demarcate the spheres of multi-national corporations, big-
scale industry, small-scale industry and cottage industry;

3. Ensure that the existing patent laws safeguarding Indian
national interests remain intact under external pressure;

4. Cut down the plethora of controls which presently exist,
and which breed corruption and dampen enterprises, and
maintain only such of these restrictions as are necessary
for social justice;

5. Foster the spirit of Swadeshi;

6. Reserve more and more consumer items to small-scale
and cottage sectors;

7. Make credit more cheaply available to small-scale industry;

8. Modernise industrial plants; and ensure fuller utilization
of capacity;

9. Promote agro-based industries;

10. Encourage Research and Development to play a live role
in industrial growth;

11. Require businessmen to consider themselves as trustees
of the public good;

12. Publicly honour excellence in industry and commerce;
and

13. Provide tax and non-tax incentives to companies for
making permanent workers share-holders out of a part

Untitled-10 371 11/7/2016 11:19:54 PM

372 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

of their gross profit.

National Textile Policy

The BJP recognises the need to have an integrated textile policy
and would ensure protection to handloom and cottage sectors
of textile industry. To this end the party will demarcate the role
of each of the Sectors viz. organised sector or mills, powerloom
and handloom sectors, and Khadi and cottage industries. The
Party would ensure cheap clothing to the poor and national and
international market to various sectors. The handloom sector would
receive adequate protection. The interests of cotton growers would
also be duly safeguarded.

Taxation

BJP would adopt firm and bold measures to prevent generation

of black-money.

1. Rationalise and simplify the entire tax structure. The
highest rate of income tax shall be 40 per cent;

2. Raise the present exemption limit of income tax to
Rs. 30,000; and introduce differential slab system and
lower rates for fixed income groups;

3. Abolish octroi duty and require the State Governments to
make good the loss of Municipalities;

4. Abolish Sales Tax and require the Centre to make good
the loss of State Governments;

5. Exempt all savings and investments in approved
organisations (including non-government institutions)
from Wealth tax and Estate duty;

6. Share Corporation tax revenues with the States;

7. Take stringent measures against the smugglers and other
economic offenders; and

8. Keep a strict watch on the operations of foreign banks.

Foreign Assets

The BJP will enact and strictly enforce a suitable legislation
so as to require all Indian citizens to disclose their foreign assets
including secret and undeclared bank accounts. The Party will
take all measures including signing treaties for unearthing Indian
unaccounted money in foreign countries.

1. Encourage the growth of small local banks, duly supervised

Untitled-10 372 11/7/2016 11:19:54 PM

Election Manifestoes * 373

and guaranteed by the Reserve Bank of India.

2. Take drastic action against tax-evasion. Motivate people for
savings and protect the honest tax-payer from harassment.

3. Pursue a policy of balanced-budget for the country and
will discontinue the present practice of huge deficits in
the national budget.

4. Impose statutory ceilings on deficits in budget and debts
of the government.

5. Convert RBI into an autonomous institution, responsible
to the Parliament for regulating the monetary policies of
the government.

Prices
BJP will maintain price stability by efficient management of
production and supplies, and by rooting out corruption - which is
a major contributory factor for price rise. With this view the party
will evolve a well coordinated wages, prices and profits policy.
The BJP will
1. Appoint a Price Commission to regulate the prices of
manufactured goods both in private and public sector;
2. Fully and promptly neutralise any rise in prices by increased
DA in both private and public sectors and in private and
Government service, including Central, State and local
government;
3. Open more fair price shops in towns and villages, existing
arrangements will be streamlined; and
4, Make not only grains, sugar and kerosene, but also pulses,
cooking oil and soap and such sundry articles of every
day use available at these shops.

Consumer Protection
The BJP is of the opinion that there must be a co-relation
between cost of production, price and profit. Nobody should be
permitted to pocket super-profits. The party also recognises the need
to enforce strict measures of quality control and price regulation.
With this view the BJP will
1. Build a powerful consumer movement and formulate
a price and profit policy for industrially manufactured

Untitled-10 373 11/7/2016 11:19:55 PM

374 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

oods;

2. Make statutory provision for declaring cost of production
of industrially manufactured items;

consumer for registering his demand for cars, scooters,
installation of telephones, gas, electric connections, etc;

Untitled-10 374 11/7/2016 11:19:55 PM

Election Manifestoes * 375

which have remained without any dependable sources of energy

The People

The Indian people are nation’s greatest assets. They are the real
instruments of transforming the country and building its future. The
BJP is fully conscious of their manifold problems and is committed
to redress their sufferings. It offers the following programme for
different sections of Indian citizens.

Rural Folk
The BJP recognises that rural poor has to be provided or
subsidised a set of social services and an infrastructure for their
speedy development. The BJP will
1. Launch Schemes to supply ample and clean drinking water
to each village, all problem villages to be covered in five
years;

. Energise every village;

. Connect the villages through all-weather pucca roads;

Provide comfortable mass transit;

. Implement schemes to offer health and family planning
knowledge, supplies and services;

. Undertake a massive drive for literacy and continuous
non-formal education to transmit professional knowledge,
and to raise the consciousness of the poor about current
injustices, and their rights;

7. Provide sanitation (with increasingly mechanised and
covered waste and sewage haulage, disposal and recycling;
and

8. Implement Housing Schemes for the poor.

employees and encourage employers to build houses for
staff;

and a will to transform India into a modern, progressive,
prosperous and front rank nation.

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
The BJP stands for all such measures which will bring the SC
and ST people at par with the rest of the society, not in terms of
economic status alone but on broad spectrum of social life giving
them a rightful place of honour to live with a sense of belonging.
The BJP will
1. Enforce laws against untouchability and atrocities very

Reservation Policy

In the opinion of the BJP the question of reservation has to be

viewed with an open mind free from all prejudices of any kind.

For this BJP commends —

1. Reservation should be continued for the Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes as before;

2. Reservation should also be made for other backward classes
broadly on the basis of the Mandal Commission Report,
with preference to be given to the poor among these very
classes; and

3. As poverty is an important contributory factor for
backwardness, reservation should also be provided for
members of the other castes on the basis of their economic
condition.

persons as a component of Social Welfare. The party will

of Social Welfare Schemes. Institutions providing such facilities
would be given tax relief.

Quality of Life

Man does not live by bread alone. He must also have health and
housing, education and sports, and above all a happy environment.

Housing and Town Development

The BJP recognises the right to shelter by all citizens of India.
The party would evolve a National Housing Policy based on the
minimum housing standards for the urban and the rural poor. In

1. Take measures for providing minimum area of land for
housing to each family at cheaper rates;

2. Expand and strengthen housing co-operatives, and
encourage trusts and other establishments for building
houses to be rented or sold;

3. Improve the basic civic amenities in towns and pay special
attention to the problems of slums to improve their habitats;

4. Develop small and medium townships to prevent

overcrowding of metropolitian towns;

Progressively develop all urban centres as garden cities;

Rationalise Housing and Rent Control laws; and

7. Double the number of houses now built annually by various
State Housing Boards.

Education

The party views with concern that with the rising cost
of education, the existing socio-economic disparities will be
perpetuated in the field of education. The BJP belives in equalisation
of educational opportunities and build up a system worthy of the
genius of our heritage and the undoubted capacities of our youth.

Untitled-10 382 11/7/2016 11:19:57 PM

Election Manifestoes * 383

Towards this end, we will

1. Implement Articles 45 of the Constitution to give free
education to all children in the 6-14 age group, evolve a
new strategy for a teacher oriented expansion programme
for this;

are neither State languages nor regional languages, but

7. Include Nepali in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.

Health and Nutrition

Health care to all citizens is the primary duty of the State.
A majority of children born in families below poverty line are
undernourished and show sign of mental retardation chiefly due to
protein deficiency. BJP, therefore, considers hygiene, sanitation and
nutrition as more important than medicines and hospitals. We will

1. Along with Allopathy, recognise and promote Ayurveda

and Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy, Chromopathy and
Nature Cure and in general encourage holistic healing;

schools, and give every child an annual physical check-up;

Science and Technology
The BJP believes that Science and Technology (ST) should be
allowed to play its due role to transform India into a prosperous,
modern and enlightened society. The party would unhesitatingly

ol

Untitled-10 384 11/7/2016 11:19:57 PM

Election Manifestoes * 385

apply appropriate scientific and technological methods for increasing
productivity, eradicating poverty, hunger and disease and to provide
meaningful employment along with ‘the basic amenities of life to
the vast percentage of population living below the poverty line.
The party holds that science is not merely harnessing nature for
material wealth but is as well liberating and enriching mind and
enlarging the human spirit. The BJP would use science in the service
of the poor and would develop technology with a human face.

The party is equally concerned about the rising trends of brain

drain. The BJP will

1. Foster a scientific temper among the people;

2. Use Science and Technology for increasing productivity
and generating employment;

3. Implement a vigorous programme of science education
and research for improving quality of life;

4. Establish a network of Centres for Application of Science
and Technology to Rural Areas, implement lab to land
programmes and develop a strong low cost agro-industrial
base;

5. Put new life in National Laboratories, develop them as
centres of excellence in applied research;

6. Direct these laboratories to evolve Appropriate Technology
for Indian needs;

7. Accelerate the production of scientific literature in regional
languages and evolve a national terminology for science
and technology; and

8. Create the right working conditions, for our best brains
to remain here and serve the country and not migrate to
other lands.

Sports

on the Olympic map of the world. We will
1. Evolve a new dynamic national sports policy aiming
at bringing 10 per cent population on the playgrounds
and winning medals in Olympic and other international
competitions;
2. Provide play fields in schools, colleges, Universities, rural

Untitled-10 385 11/7/2016 11:19:57 PM

areas and open sports complexes in all districts with
modern equipments under a time bound programme;

3. Give remuneration to sportspersons at par with those
available to the sports persons of advanced countries;

4. Ensure job security for sportsmen and admission to the
colleges and technical courses; and

5. Respect the Olympic charter and autonomy of the sports
bodies and will prohibit governmentalisation of sports.

Family Welfare and Population Policy

The BJP recognises the growing concern of the people about
the dangers of a demographic explosion and distortions created
by the mishandling of the population control programmes by
the Congress(I) government. The BJP is committed to the policy
of responsible parenthood and believes that population control
programme should be given top priority while formulating national
plans. It expects all sections of Indian community to fully participate
in these programmes. The BJP will

1. Strive for creating a national consensus for adopting a
National Population Policy and if necessary to take suitable
legislative measures for it;

2. Make Family Planning information and facilities available
to the people. Involve all voluntary, social and cultural
organisations in creating an awareness for adopting family
planning as a way of life;

Environment

The BJP attaches high priority to stop the degradation of
environment. In the opinion of the BJP, the rapid depletion of
natural resources, risks of green house effect, the destruction of
tropical rain-forests, and the hazards of dumping of industrial
waste and discharge of highly toxic materials in air and water
are matters of global concern and world opinion has to be alerted
against them. International efforts are needed to save the planet.
Preservation of environment has been an integral part of Indian
way of life. We look upon India as Bharat Mata and a holy land.
Our land, air, waters, our hills, forests, flora and fauna are all
sacred to us. We will keep them neat, clean and intact. We will

1. Formulate a National Resources Management Policy and
adopt a holistic approach in planning;

2. Require anti-pollution devices to be installed to process
and clean up industrial and Municipal effluents before
the same are discharged into our rivers;

3. Keep a strict watch on chemical fertilizers and insecticides

for any poisoning of the soil;

Improve auto exhausts to prevent the fouling of the air;

. Curb the aggression of noise in the cities;

. Undertake a massive afforestation programme;

While protecting the traditional rights of Vanavasis, we

will require the planting of three trees for every single

tree that is cut by anybody for any reason;

8. Make environmental concerns an integral part of education;
and

9. Take special care in import of technology and promote
research for developing indigenous pollution free
technology.

NS os

Culture
The BJP believes in preserving and propagating the cultural
values which have kept India united through the ages. It will
1. Conserve the ancient heritage of India and make people
feel proud of it;
2. Promote Indian values of life through cultural centres;
3. Acquaint people with the glorious traditions and

Untitled-10 387 11/7/2016 11:19:58 PM

388 * Party Document Vol-1

achievements of ancient Indian genius in the fields of
science, technology, medicine, agriculture, etc;

4. Wage a relentless war against superstitions and outmoded
customs; and

5. Emphasise on culture as a dynamic and synthetic process.

Arts

Art is the essence of life. BJP will encourage all art forms. It
will make the various arts, part of Education, Production and Life.

To promote theatre, BJP will, as a rule, exempt all theatrical
performances from entertainment tax.

The BJP will encourage folk art in various fields.

Films
BJP recognises the great role of cinema in entertainment,
education and national integration. BJP will
1. Have, in addition to ‘A’ and ‘U’ Films, ‘Q’ that is Quality
films, which will be exempt from entertainment taxes;
2. Have special theatres in metropolitan centres to screen art
films and other Quality films; and
3. Implement the recommendations of the Karanth Committee
on National Film Policy.

Tourism
The BJP recognises the importance of tourism as an instrument
of national integration, international understanding and employment
generation. India abounds in natural beauty and charming tourist
centres, which have fascinated people from far distant quarters.
It will
1. Promote tourism both national and international as an
industry and give incentives to those who take it as a
profession;
2. Will evolve a policy of integrating tourism and marketing
of handicrafts and other art works;
3. Take a scheme of training tourist guides and opening
tourist homes and information centres; and

channels.

Mass Media
The BJP reaffirms its commitments to the freedom of thought
and expression. We will

1. Make freedom of the Press an explicit Fundamental Right,
and not just an implied one derived from the citizen’s right
to Freedom of Expression;

2. Encourage the growth of the Press by abolishing the duty
on newsprint and the tax on newspaper advertising;

3. Revive the ‘Prasar Bharati Bill’ of 1979, which sought
to convert AIR and Doordarshan into an autonomous
corporation. The Corporation would have greater autonomy
than that enjoyed by BBC today;

4. Review the Official Secrets Act in so far as it obstructs the
Right to Know and enact a Freedom of Information Law;
and

5. Implement the P.C. Joshi Report on TV software to improve

National Security

The BJP holds that National security is a primary responsibility of
State. Security of the nation is an integrated whole: an amalgam
of the internal, the economic, the social, the political, the military
and the diplomatic. The BJP will, therefore, resolve the social and
political turmoil in strategically sensitive border states like Jammu
& Kashmir, Punjab, North East and Assam. Indian diplomacy can
assist in the protection of our national interests only if it is guided
by a purposeful foreign policy.

Foreign Policy

The conduct of diplomacy by the Rajiv Government has left
India’s foreign policy in tatters. Never has the country faced so
much animosity from so many of our neighbours, as today. It
is BJP’s view that the challenges we face in the field of external
relations, arise from a re-assertion of the altered importance of
non-alignment, as a concept, in a rapidly transforming world. It
is our view that increasingly, we should give emphasis to foreign
economic policy under the time-proved concept of non-alignment.
It is vital to move the world towards a greater and more effective
North-South and South-South Co-operation.

The BJP has stood for, and is committed to mutually beneficial
aim of good bilaterial relations with all our neighbours and a
strengthening of SAARC. We stand for a normalisation of relations
with China, with due safeguards for Tibet, proper recognition of
India’s national interests and honourable solution of the border
dispute. We would work for a comprehensive package of settlement
of all outstanding matters with Pakistan and a widening of the
people-to-people relations between our two countries. We would

Untitled-10 390 11/7/2016 11:19:58 PM

Election Manifestoes * 391

work for an early withdrawal of the IPKF from Sri Lanka. With
Nepal BJP would seek the re-establishment of harmonious relations
based on the concept of interdependent growth.

The BJP stands for a foreign policy committed to world peace,
disarmament and a non-exploitative new international economic
order. The Party will

1. Work towards re-imparting dynamism to the non-aligned

movement;

2. Pursue a policy of peace, friendship and co-operation with

neighbouring countries;

3. Reject the domination of super-power interest in South

Asia and the Indian Ocean;

4. Work towards the establishment of a regional common

market by strengthening South Asian Regional Conference;

5. Work for the establishment of a new international economic

order, take initiative for trade and monetary reform, North-
South dialogue with emphasis on enhanced South-South
Co-operation;

6. Continued efforts for the world-wide rejection of apartheid;

and

7. Continuously work towards the solution of problems of

people of Indian origin living abroad.

Defence

Defence preparedness has suffered grievously in the hands of
Rajiv Government gripped as it is, by ad-hocism and by corruption
surrounding defence procurements. This has brought to a standstill
all policy-making and implementation within the Defence Ministry.
The other great harm that Rajiv Government has caused to the
country is excessive misemployment in an adventurous manner,
of the Indian Armed Forces on Political roles or on militarily
unattainable tasks. This has caused a very serious lowering of
the morale of our Armed Forces, and hence of its total combat
effectiveness. BJP wishes to caution the nation against the extremely
harmful consequences if such a situation is permitted to continue.

The BJP would work actively towards reviving the morale
of the Armed Forces, giving a solemn assurance that the Indian
Armed Forces, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, would not

Untitled-10 391 11/7/2016 11:19:58 PM

392 ¢ Party Document Vol-1

lack either in equipment or in the necessary wherewithals to execute
their responsibilities.

The BJP will exert for —

1. Optimum defence preparedness including production of

nuclear bombs and delivery systems;

2. Diversification of sources of supply of defence hardware,
continued emphasis on maximising indigenous production,
self-reliance and Defence Research and Development;
Greater public accountability of defence expenditure;
Enhancement of Indian Navy’s capability;

5. Identification, and elimination of, foreign lobbies associated

with defence weapons procurement and contracts; and

6. Improve service conditions in the Armed Forces so as

to make careers in the Army, Navy and Air Force more
attractive to the best talent in the country.

This then is the programme which the BJP pledges to implement
under the inspiring leadership of Shri A.B. Vajpayee and Shri L.K.
Advani. The dedicated cadres of the party, headed by these brilliant
leaders of impeccable record of clean public life and selfless service
to the nation, are committed to usher in a new political culture. In
the opinion of the BJP a critical moment of history has arrived for
India. The country can not afford to miss this moment of history,
this opportunity to throw out the last vestige of the dynastic rule
mainly responsible for this country’s ruination.

The BJP on its part has left no stone unturned in its efforts
to put up a determined and united electoral battle and has
unhesitatingly sacrificed its party interests whenever national
interests so demanded. The Bharatiya Janata Party calls upon the
people to join in its struggle for a value based polity and throw
out this corrupt and incompetent government.

Election Manifesto

Untitled-10 393

Untitled-10 394 11/7/2016 11:19:59 PM

Indian polity today stands at a critical crossroad of history. The state
of the nation is examplified by the breakdown of law and order,
an absence of purpose and direction in governance, deep divisions
within society marked by deliberately engineered communal and
castesist passions, and a serious erosion of institutions. Near about
half our citizens continue to groan under the dehumanising yoke
of abject poverty aggravated by spiraling prices. Urban chaos and
rural neglect have degraded the quality of our citizens’ life.

The shocking assassination of the late Prime Minister
and subsequent occurrences are the most horrifying and telling
symptoms of erosion of moral authority and a total decay of the
ruling party.

At such a critical juncture a new direction and a fresh political
initiative was expected from the successor government. Betraying
all hopes, the government of the day, mired in immobility, a
prisoner of the old caucus, continues cynically to repeat yesterday’s
irrelevancies. When decisive action is called for, it merely mouths
platitudes and attempts to transfer responsibility by accusing others.

National integrity, unity, and cohesion are the paramount need
of the hour; the reestablishment of national consensus a primary
task. Today’s challenge cannot be met by yesterday’s government.

The need of the hour is a new polity, anew government, a new
leadership. In the new polity we stand committed to value-based
politics, to democracy, to positive secularism, and to Gandhian
economics.

India needs a new government which is clean, effective
purposeful and representative of the rich diversity of our land.
Such a government must restore the moral authority of the State,
commit itself afresh to the integrity of the nation and guarantee
the security of every single citizen of the country. This Republic of

Untitled-10 395 11/7/2016 11:19:59 PM

ours can no longer be left a Prisoner of the corrupt and criminal.
To fulfill this task the Bharatiya Janata Party offers to the
nation the following programme.

oO

 

Untitled-10 396 11/7/2016 11:19:59 PM

National Politics
National Unity and Positive Secularism

BJP is pledged to defend the unity and integrity of India. It believes
that India, from Kashmir to Kanya Kumari, is one country, and all
Indians, irrespective of language, caste or creed, are one people.

Unity in diversity has been the hallmark of Indian culture,
which is a unique multi-heud synthesis of the cultural contributions
made over the centuries by different peoples and religions. In
Indian tradition, since times immemorial, the State has always
been a civil institution, which makes no distinction between one
citizen and another on grounds of his religion. The very idea of a
theocratic state is alien to Indian political history. So, when India
became independent in 1947, we very naturally declared ourselves
a secular state, unconcerned that Pakistan had opted for theocracy.

It is this positive concept of secularism to which BJP is
committed. Secularism should not be allowed to become a
euphemism for appeasement, alternately of this community, or
that, or a sordid political device to garner bloc-votes.

Ours is a democratic federal Constitution. It envisages strong
States, with a strong Centre. Indeed the whole cannot be strong
unless the constituent parts are strong too. But over the years the
States have been increasingly reduced to glorified municipalities.
The BJP will restore the balance between the Centre and the States
as visualised by our constitution makers. And to that end, it will:

1. Support and strengthen state Governments and not

destabilize and topple them;

2. Appoint State Governors in consultation with State

Governments;

Untitled-10 397 11/7/2016 11:19:59 PM

398 * Party Document Vol-1

3. Enact an anti-Defection Law;

4. Limit the number of ministers to 10 per cent of legislators;
as per the Report of the Committee on Defections;

5. Give the states a fairer share of Central revenues and
increase the financial powers of the States;

6. Delete the temporary Article 370 of the Constitution;

7. Constitute an Inter-State Council under Article 263 to settle
all Inter-State and State-Centre disputes; and

8. Guarantee to all minorities, linguistic and religious, peace
and security, and full opportunities for progress and
development.

Fair Elections

The BJP believes in the primacy of elections. It is convinced
that elections must be held regularly and very fairly. They must
honestly reflect the public mind. And the parties fighting these
elections must also function democratically —and cleanly.

Four evils threaten to subvert the freedom and fairness of
elections — money-power, ministerial-power, media-power and
muscle-power. The BJP is resolved to contain and curb all these evils.

The party will give high priority to electoral reform. More
specifically, BJP will

1. Give the right of vote to all those above eighteen;

2. Introduce Identity Cards for voters;

3. Use electronic voting machines, and to this end, make
necessary changes in the election law;

4. As recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee
on Amendments to Election Law, examine the feasibility
of introducing the List system of elections;

5. Give the right of Postal Ballot to Indian citizens living
abroad;

6. Hold State and Central elections simultaneously every
five years;

7. Make the Election Commission a multi-member body;
strengthen its independence by making expenditure
incurred on the Commission expenditure charged on the
Consolidated Fund of India, as is provided in the case of

High Court judges, and by providing the Commission
with an independent, minimal infrastructure;

8. Extend the jurisdiction of the Election Commission to local
body elections, and to ensure that elections to local bodies
are held regularly;

9. Arrange for public funding of elections, as is the case in
Germany, Japan and most other democratic countries;

10. Have party accounts publicly audited;

11. To prevent abuse of governmental power by the ruling party,
give legal teeth to the Code of Conduct framed by Election
Commission; violation of the code shall be made a corrupt
practice under the law.

Corruption

In the last 4 years or so corruption has not only become way
of life but has in fact been institutionalized and legitimized. An
unholy nexus has developed between the corrupt politician, the
corrupt bureaucrat and the corrupt businessman. The volume of
black-money has grown phenomenally and is now estimated at
around 50 per cent of the total money in circulation.

The BJP holds that the roots of all corruption lie in political and
electoral corruption. While measures to cleanse elections have been
dealt with earlier, with regard to political corruption in general,
the BJP will, inter alia, take the following steps:

1. It will enact a law, and create an Ombudsman-Lokpal and
Lokayaukta — as recommended by the Administrative
Reform’s Commission; and

2. Streamline procedures and rules relating to purchases
awarding of contracts etc. in Government and public
sector undertakings and regulate discretionary powers of
political authorities; political interference and intervention
in day-to-day End Government departments and public
sector functioning of actions, dealing with purchases and
award of contracts etc.; Rationalise and streamline the tax
structure, providing sufficient incentives to savings and
avoiding harassment to honest tax-payers and to avoid
generation of black money; Require all Ministers to make
an annual declaration of assets.

Our North East

All our North Eastern States suffer from unsatisfactory,
economic development, insufficient recognition of local diversity,
inadequate participation in National tasks, unchecked illegal
immigration resulting in demographic imbalances and serious
social destabilisation. The BJP believes that a resolution of all
these problems has to be undertaken jointly and keeping in mind
the peculiarities of the region. In this endeavor the Brahmaputra
Valley and the State of Assam play a crucial role. No integrated
development of the region is possible if Assam continues to remain
unstable.

The BJP will, therefore, give high priority to the solution of
the many problems afflicting Assam. It will work purposefully and
expeditiously for their early resolution.

Whilst cooperating with the efforts of the Chief Election
Commissioner, to carry out a detailed enumeration, leading to a
proper revision and publication of electoral rolls, the party will
simultaneously continue to emphasise the need for adequate
safeguards so that the scrutiny of enumeration lists becomes
meaningful.

Mindful of the national commitment of bonafide refugees in
the region, the BJP will work continuously to protect their interests.

In addition, the BJP will take all effective steps to prevent
further illegal immigration. For this purpose it will work towards
joint, cooperative effort by all the concerned adjoining states like
Tripura, West Bengal and Bihar.

At the heart of the continued impasse in Assam is the alienation
of a whole section of our countrymen, resulting in the citizens of
that state being deprived of their right to participate in current
elections. The BJP will immediately resume the process of negotiation
and reconciliation so that the many problems of the region can be
tackled with the wholehearted participation of the citizens.

Punjab

‘The BJP shares the agony of Punjab with the Punjabis. It
congratulates the people of Punjab on maintaining the peace in
the Punjab in the face of grave provocation.

The BJP holds the Congress (I) squarely responsible for

Untitled-10 400 11/7/2016 11:20:00 PM

Election Manifestoes * 401

encouraging separatist and terrorist elements in the Punjab. As
a result, for four long agonising years, the State has been subject
to an orgy of murder and mayhem. The tragic murder of Prime
Minister Mrs Gandhi, and the bestial carnage which followed in
its wake, also, are poison-fruits of Government's Punjab policy.
The BJP wishes to declare unequivocally that the nation shall
not allow another assault on the country’s integrity, and that there
can be no compromise with those who talk of Khalistan. At the
same time, the BJP will not suffer any harm being done to innocent
people, Hindu or Sikh.
1. The Punjab problem is basically political and we will solve
it politically;
2. Separatism and terrorism will be sternly dealt with;
3. We will adequately compensate the sufferers of violence
during the last three years;
4. The BJP will refer territorial claims and counterclaims river
waters and other outstanding issues, to the Chief Justice
of India, for arbitration within one year.

Law & Order
The BJP views with alarm the rise of social violence in the
country. This includes communal violence, atrocities on Harijans
and tribals, and criminal assaults on women. It is committed to the
security of life, limb, property and honour of all citizens. Whenever
there is a serious eruption of violence
1. There must be a judicial inquiry;
2. The inquiry report must be published;
3. The Report recommendations must be implemented;
4. Men guilty of incitement to violence or dereliction of duty
will be punished;
5. All riot sufferers must be suitably and adequately
compensated and rehabilitated;
6. We will conduct in-depth socio-economic studies of riot
prone areas to take effective steps for riot-prevention.

The Police & The People

The Police is a vital organ of the State. Over the years, the gulf
between the people and the Police has grown very wide. The people
complain of Police Zulum; and the Police complains of political
interference and of bad living and working conditions. The BJP will

Untitled-10 401 11/7/2016 11:20:00 PM

402 * Party Document Vol-1

1. Implement the Police Commission’s recommendations
particularly with regard to the emoluments and service
conditions of police personnel;

2. Modernise the Police Force and convert it into an efficient
and impartial instrument of law and order:

3. Set up a machinery for redressal of Police People’s
grievances;

4. Stop political meddling in police work;

5. Set up local committees of respected citizens to bridge the
gap between the People and the Police.

Justice
The BJP attaches the greatest importance to Justice —Justice
that will be quick, inexpensive and just. It notes with regret that
over the years there has been an all all-round deterioration in this
respect. The Independence of the Judiciary has been seriously
eroded. BJP will take corrective steps to restore the independence,
integrity and efficiency of the judicial system. We will
1. Simplify the legal procedures and increase the number of
judges, so that no case lingers on beyond one year;
2. Appoint Chief Justices strictly in order of seniority;
3. Not harass judges with politically inspired transfers;
4. Offer better emoluments to judges to attract more talent
to the Bench;
5. Raise the retirement age of judges to 65, give them full
pensions equal to their salary, and give them quasi-judicial
work after retirement without extra cash payment.

Human Rights Commission

BJP will widen the scope of the present ineffective Minorities
Commission and convert it into a Human Rights Commission to take
care of the just rights of all individuals, groups and communities.

National Economy

The National Economy is in bad shape. While production is moving
up at snail’s pace, prices are galloping away. More people are
unemployed today than at the time of Independence. The rich
are getting richer while the poor stay poor. Village industries are
dying. Many of our industries are working at only 40 per cent of
capacity. More and more millions are falling below the Poverty
Line everywhere. Last year alone the Public Sector lost Rs. 6,000
crores (Rupees Six thousand crores) only.

The BJP will reverse all these ugly trends and give the country
a humane economy. It will take all steps necessary to achieve full
employment, maximise production, stabilise prices and pull more
and more millions above the Poverty Line, until nobody is left
poor in the country.

Agriculture
Agriculture is our biggest industry. It is the backbone of the
economy. BJP will encourage it in every way. In particular, we will
1. Implement the land laws; quickly complete on-going big
irrigation projects; start thousands of small irrigation
works; subsidies inputs; give remunerative prices; establish
a parity of agricultural and industrial prices;
2. Specially encourage pulses, oil seeds, fruits, nuts and,
vegetables cultivation, and also production of cash crops;
3. Increase milk supply and effect a White Revolution;
4. Attain food self-sufficiency and never again need to import
food-grains.
BJP will encourage and improve industry all-round. We will
1. Make the public sector productive and profitable;

Untitled-10 403 11/7/2016 11:20:01 PM

404 * Party Document Vol-1

2. Demarcate the spheres of multinational corporations, other
foreign companies, big industry, small-scale industry and
cottage industry;

3. Cut down on the plethora of controls which presently exist,

and which breed corruption and dampen enterprise; and

maintain only such of these restrictions as are necessary
for social justice.

Foster the Swadeshi spirit;

Reserve more and more consumer items to small-scale

and cottage sectors;

Make credit more cheaply available to small-scale industry;

Modernise industrial plants;

ae

Promote agro-based industries;

Encourage Research and Development;

10. Require businessmen to act as trustees of the public good;
and

11. Publicly honour excellence in industry and commerce.

Se MOND

Finance

The BJP will handle public funds with the same care and

caution as one would handle one’s own funds.

1. We will not impose any new taxes;

2. We will reduce some taxes. To begin with, the income tax
exemption will be raised to Rs. 30,000;

3. We will abolish octroi duty-and require the State
Government to make good the loss of municipalities;

4. We will abolish Sales Tax and require the Centre to make
good the loss of State Governments, by matching increases
in excise duties;

5. We will rationalise and simplify the entire tax structure.
The highest rate of income tax shall be 49 per cent;

6. All savings and investments in approved organisations
(including non-government institutions.) will be exempted
from wealth tax and Estate duty;

7. Corporation tax revenues will be shared with the States;

8. Smugglers and other economic offenders will be severely
dealt with;

Election Manifestoes * 405

9. A strict watch will be kept on the operations of foreign
banks,

10. We will encourage the growth of small local banks, duty

supervised and guaranteed by the Reserve Bank of India.

Prices

BJP will maintain price stability by efficient management of

production and supplies, and by rooting out corruption.

1. Any rise in prices will be fully and promptly neutralised
by increased DA in both private and public sectors and in
private and Government service, including central, State
and local government.

2. We will open more Fair Price Shops in towns and villages;
existing arrangements will be streamlined.

3. Make not only grains, sugar and kerosene, but also pulses,
cooking oil and soap and such sundry articles of every
day use available at these shops.

Labour

BJP believes in healthy trade unionism. It will

1. Rationalise and simplify Labour Laws;

2. Recognise unions on the basis of secret ballot;

3. Introduce worker participation from the Shop Floor to the
Board Room in all public sector projects, public limited
companies and foreign companies operating in India; and

4. Insulate workers against inflation (specific measures spelt
out in the next chapter).

Full Employment

BJP recognises the citizen’s Fundamental Right to work. All
our economic policies whether it is small dams or cottage industry,
house construction or road building will boost employment. In
addition we will

1. Introduce Employment Guarantee Scheme on the

Maharashtra pattern, throughout the country;
2. There will be pensions for the aged poor; and
3. There will be ‘Antyodaya’ for the poorest of the poor.

Energy
There is a serious energy crisis throughout the world. The
crisis is particularly acute in India with heavy oil imports, serious
power-shortages and high power prices. This Situation will have
to be tackled on a war-footing. BJP will
1. Intensify efforts to find more oil, coal and natural gas
reserves;
2. Improve the working of power plants which are now
functioning at less than 50 per cent of capacity;
Stop the massive theft of electric power;
4. Introduce power-efficient energy-saving devices in homes
and factories;

The People

People, whether in the villages or in towns and cities, have had a
raw deal all these years. BJP will make life more bearable for them.

Villagers
1. Since a majority of the people live in villages, a major
portion of development funds will be invested in the
villages;
2. Drinking water will be made available to all the remaining
about 1.5 lakh waterless villages during the next five years;

. Cow slaughter will be banned;

4. In the first stage all villages with a population of 1,000
will be connected by pucca road;

5. Likewise, all villages with a population of 1,000 will be
given electric connection;

6. Village artisans will be trained and their techniques
modernised. For example, smiths will become mechanics,
carpenters will make furniture, washermen will become
dry-cleaners etc;

7. Local people will be given preference in the matter of local
jobs;

8. Panchayats will be reorganised in the true spirit of
Panchayati Raj;

9. Mobile courts will decide minor disputes locally.

OQ

Townsmen
1. House construction by individuals, trusts, commercial
establishments and cooperatives will be encouraged to
make more houses available at reasonable rents;

Untitled-10 407 11/7/2016 11:20:01 PM

408 * Party Document Vol-1

2. City water, power and sewage services will be improved;

3. All applicants on the waiting list will be given telephone
connections;

4. The menace of goondas will be ended; and

5. All urban centres will be progressively made into garden
cities.

Salariat
The BJP fully appreciates the problems of the salaried class,
now crushed between ‘fixed incomes and rising prices. It will
1. Link salaries in private services also to cost of living index;
2. Encourage employers to build houses for staff;
3. Progressively introduce pension schemes in private service,
private sector and public sector;
4. Lower Life Insurance premia;
5. Increase the return on Provident Fund deposits;
6. Abolish Compulsory Deposit Scheme;
7. Ensure payment of pension and GPF dues within one
month of retirement; and
8. Ask all establishments to build Holiday Homes and organize
cooperative stores, for their staff.

Government Employees
Central Government employees suffer from all the problems
of the salariat; additionally, their salaries are lower than those in
private service. Indeed, fourteen State Governments are paying
higher salaries than the Central Government. BJP will move fast
in the matter. It will
1. Ask the Fourth Pay Commission to submit a quick interim
report, doing urgent justice to the employees;
2. Order full and prompt neutralisation of all increases in
the cost of living index;
3. Immediately pay all arrears of DA instalments that have
become due;
4. Provide residential accommodation to all Government
employees.

Untitled-10 408 11/7/2016 11:20:01 PM

Election Manifestoes * 409

Pensioners

The pensioners are the most hard-pressed in the fixed income

group. BJP will

1. Replace the 1871 Pension Act by a new law, more in tune
with the changed social security concepts;

2. Have a National Pensions Policy to secure social and
economic justice to all citizens;

3. Constitute a separate Pension Commission to examine the
special problems of pensioners;

4. Grant pensioners DA relief on the same scale as to serving
employees; exempt pensioners from payment of income
tax;

5. Re-fix pensions as and when pay scales are revised; and

6. Grant travel concessions to pensioners.

Ex-servicemen

The welfare of ex-servicemen is inextricably linked with the
morale of serving personnel because we believe that today’s soldier,
sail or airman is tomorrow’s ex-serviceman.

The BJP holds that insufficient attention has been paid to
their welfare, pensions, re-employment and other allied matters,
The BJP would work towards a purposeful resolution of all these
problems. We believe that the last Supreme Court judgement has
given grounds for a great deal of disaffection. We would, therefore,
take steps to ensure that:

1. Standard pension rate is kept at not less than 50 per cent

of the total emoluments last drawn;

2. Introduce one rank-one pension system. This would include

all old pensioners irrespective of their date of retirement;

3. Introduce a proper system for taking into account the cost

of living and corresponding adjustments in pensions.

4. Take steps to restore the commuted value of pension or,

completion of the period of commutation;

5. Widows of pensioners who retired prior to 1.1.1964 to
be given the same pension as is applicable in the case of
family pensioners or reservists;

Strengthen Zilla and District Sainik Boards;
Enlarge the terms of reference of the Fourth Central Pay
Commission so as to include the question of pensions.

Quality Of Life

Man does not live by bread alone. He must also have health and
housing, education and sports, and above all a happy environment.

Health
Health is wealth. BJP considers hygiene, sanitation and

Untitled-10 413 11/7/2016 11:20:03 PM

Culture

The BJP reaffirms its commitment to the freedom of thought and
expression. We will

1. Make freedom of the Press an explicit Fundamental Right,
and not just an implied one derived from the citizen’s right
to Freedom of Expression;

2. Encourage the growth of the Press by abolishing the duty
on newsprint and the tax on newspaper advertising;

3. Revive the Prasar Bharati Bill of 1979, which sought
to convert AIR and Doordarshan into an autonomous

Right to Know and enact a Freedom of Information law
on the US lines,

5. Implement the P.C. Joshi Report on T.V. software, to

Films
BJP recognises the “real role of cinema in entertainment

education and national integration. It is also conscious of the damage
that is being caused to the moral and social fibre of the people by
their exposure to violence and vulgarity in films. The censors can
play only a negative role. What is needed is conscious promotion
and development of good cinema. The BJP will

1. Have, in addition to A and U Films, ‘Q’, that is

Quality films, which will be exempt from entertainment

taxes;

2. Have special theatres in metropolitan centres to

Untitled-10 414 11/7/2016 11:20:03 PM

Election Manifestoes * 415

screen art films and other Quality films; and

Committee on National Film Policy.

will make the various arts, part of Education, Production and Life.
To promote theatre, BJP will, as a rule, exempt all theatrical
performances from entertainment tax.

Government has set up a Sports Ministry; but it has issued
Policy Directive. And it has few resources, BJP will arrange that

National Security

National security is a primary responsibility. The BJP would
work towards fulfilling this national duty with a sense of high
purpose. Security of the nation is an integrated whole: an amalgam
of the internal, the economic, the social, the political, the military
and the diplomatic. Internal cohesiveness, and a united and
determined national will is the foundation of a nation’s defence
preparedness. The BJP will, therefore, resolve the social and
political turmoil in strategically sensitive border states like J &
K, Punjab, North East and Assam. Indian diplomacy can assist
in the protection of our national interests only if it is guided by
a purposeful foreign policy.

Foreign Policy

The BJP will continue to follow an independent foreign policy
committed to world peace, disarmament and a new international
economic order. We believe that the task of freeing the world
from economic exploitation, external influences, domination,
and colonialism in all its new forms is yet to be completed. For
this a continued strengthening of the non-aligned movement is
the foundation of our policy plank. BJP will

1. Work towards re-imparting dynamism to the non-
aligned movement;

2. Reject the domination of super-power interests in
South Asia and the Indian Ocean;

3. Pursue a poilcy of peace, friendship and cooperation
with its neighbouring countries;

4. Re-establish India’s Asian identity with emphasis

on a policy of constructive cooperation in South and South East

Untitled-10 416 11/7/2016 11:20:03 PM

Asia;

5. Strengthen South Asian Regional Conference and
work towards the formation of closer economic ties leading to
the establishment of a regional common market;

6. Initiate fresh endeavours for the withdrawal of
foreign forces from Afghanistan — a political solution of the
Afghan problem, free from outside intervention or interference
so that Afghanistan and its identity as an independent, non-
aligned nation could be re-established;

7. Work for the establishment of a new international
economic order; take initiative for trade and monetary reform;
North-South dialogue with emphasis on enhanced South-South
co-operation;

8. Work towards Non-aligned initiatives for a
resolution of the Iran-Iraq war; the problem in Lebanon and the
Arab-Israel dispute;

9. Continued efforts for the freedom of Namibia, and
a worldwide rejection of apartheid; and
10. Continuously work towards the solution of problems

of people of Indian origin living abroad, more particularly the
plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka.

Defence
The Bhartiya Janata Party will exert for:
1. Optimum defence preparedness;
2. Diversification of sources of supply of defence

ardware; continued emphasis on maximizing indigenous
hardware; t d h d
production; self-reliance and Defence Research and Development;

3. Greater public accountabiiity of defence expenditure;

4. Enhancement of Indian Navy’s capability;

5. Identification, and elimination of foreign lobbies
associated with defence weapons procurement and contracts; and

6. Improve service conditions in the Armed Forces

so as to make careers in the Army, Navy, and Air Force more
attractive to the best talent in the country.

Here above is a proud and patriotic programme that the BJP
pledges to implement. And it has the will, the ability and the
integrity to implement it well. Its disciplined cadres are the
envy of other parties. And its collective leadership, headed by

Untitled-10 417 11/7/2016 11:20:03 PM

the inimitable Atal Bihari Vajpayee is the best and the brightest
in the land.

The BJP commits itself to addressing all religious, linguistic
and ethnic groups and work purposefully for a just and speedy
redressal of their due grievances and issues that alienate. It
reaffirms its faith in all Indians being co-sharers in the continuing
task of nation-building and invites all to work shoulder to
shoulder with the rest of their brethren. This process of healing
and reconciliation cannot be undertaken by that very government
which earlier caused the dismemberment of our national
consensus.

The BJP commits itself afresh to the betterment of the Harijan,
the Girijan, the backward, the downtrodden, the working class,
the unemployed, the artisan and the women of India.

The betterment of the kisan, the upliftment of the rural landless
and the amelioration of the lot of the poorest of the poor is our
firm commitment.

To the youth of India we make a special appeal. You are the
future destiny of our land. Come, join us in our endeavour, to
build a new India.

The BJP accepts the challenge of the day, pledges itself to meeting
the need of the hour, invites all citizen’s to share these concerns
and aspirations, and to join with us in our quest for a new value-
based polity.
